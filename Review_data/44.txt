The single important thing thriller work lack loopholes. From story seems smart appears sorted-out Aa Dekhen Zara becomes full holes sieve reach basic plot. At half-point know looking great work art looking forward quick-paced slick piece thrill. And hear cookie crumble, try ignore it. "It can't bad" say. And see crumble know damage irreparable. The inevitable, irrelevant, sleazy dance begins. Some villainous looking men ask sexy lady dance obliges. Except nothing fearsome guys. This one song indescribably out-of-place situation-wise also out-of-synch general tone movie. Not mention it's hilarious see Neil Nitin Mukesh call Bipasha Basu gori (fair skinned). And yet comes along things avoided make film tad bit charming. With something powerful piece equipment make predictions, protagonists don't aim anything lofty altruistic. So, don't see film taking purpose seriously. Unfortunately, takes lightly entire suspense, "damn! What next?" results anti-climatic molehill. Like departments, dialogues inconsistent. The occasionally witty lines dive blech float back average. Thankfully though, Neil Nitin Mukesh's narration character, Ray's thoughts annoying spoon-feeding usually be. I really don't know managed Neil didn't really need emote, voiceover left doubt thinking. That still doesn't mean didn't act well. There's something eyes could conveyed thought allowed to. Bipasha Basu playing DJ, Simi...well, little bit emote audience bothered look neck. Hey! I'm voyeuristic, purpose I damn well appreciate it, right? Well, usual excellent job looking good. Other that, costumes looked like costumes dresses normal person would wear. The rest cast done hideously superficial job. Earlier movie though, I found enjoying pace. It doesn't stop anything anyone. Aa Dekhen Zara smoothly flows one incident another, especially beginning. I especially enjoyed pace romance Ray Simi. In fact, I enjoyed romantic moment cinema long, long time. Later, like rest movie, even pace becomes jerky jumps feels obligated take. Oh, way, looking take away cool action sequences least - let save time, money, energy. There's none. Some light, nice build-up first half burst balloon second.
