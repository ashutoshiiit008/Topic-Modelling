Love Breakups Zindagi deliberately written made film. You see thought put growth characters interactions. Unfortunately, makers aren't able build momentum soon enough. They take long establish chemistry various characters ends little slow. Unfortunately, happens trying imitate life. It takes time establish friendships romantic relationships. The little things attract people take sweet time reveal themselves. Real people give lot thought breaking partner tough decision. But, times slow pace works film times doesn't. In Love Breakups Zindagi mostly doesn't. Sadly, lack trying. I really like simple theme picked make film about, "Opposites attract, choose like-minded partner" ironically, simplicity makes dull. The effort visible. The restraint spending 30-45 minutes film wedding set-up keeping quite visible I actually appreciate too. But, dialogue plain thus boring. Maybe, film left better actors, would pepped film bit. But, Zayed Khan doesn't work romantic hero. Every time tries emote sentimental emotion, brings cringe. Dia Mirza good confused girl wants right thing, nothing special her. Cyrus Sahukar effected dialogue delivery, words don't flow. Tisca Chopra one looks competent fit role, must cake walk her. I usually, avoid talking cameos, Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance brings real, believable reaction Naina (Dia Mirza). It adorable. But cameo, like cameos, dispensible. And hurts biggest culprit Love Breakups Zindagi's failure length. Had cameos chopped off, couple side-stories taken away, film would crisper product rather limp one, likely watch among many things flipping channels. Love Breakups Zindagi one cases rating "watch nothing better do" sounds bit harsh. It doesn't laugh loud super-aawwww moments. But sweet relatable insights relationships. But patient person enjoy them.
