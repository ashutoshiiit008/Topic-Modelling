Sankat City - metropolitan that's metaphor human nature. Each us lot evil us core there's goodness. And incidentally it’s metro environment known make us people are. And yet film starts well time midpoint loses way, becomes repetitive, boring. It also becomes tad loud. Also spoofing old Hindi films done often recent past doesn't impress. Some directorial decisions impressive though. They took huge risk choosing grainy texture gives feel film 70s-80s worked big time. It makes film stand glitzy, crisp images used to. It fascinated end film. A montage interesting, weird characters weaved together. It fun see way labyrinth. Because weird becomes bizarre - yes it's possible. And fun sort-of way. Unfortunately, stretch little long lost - happens last 30-45 minutes. But good performers keep sailing through. The casting lead actors near perfect. Choose Kay Kay Menon role works, doubts there. Rimi Sen Hindi films' best lady-crook. She mastered smirk, know-it-all look, "Damn! Why I get confused? I'm bad girl, I good-good feelings?" expression. Another impressive performance Dilip Prabhawalkar. Though exaggerated come across poor old man needed taken care of. I'm fence-sitter far Anupam Kher concerned. I always look forward films can't handle goes slapsticky mode. And huge chunk role slapstick. The rest cast exaggerated spoof-Bollywood types enjoy them. That's thing Bollywood-parodies days. With intention reminding us yesteryears Bolly's follies, exactly things annoy actual films. And here's circle I'm tiring of. A typical comedy Hindi film slapstick chain implausible events. A spoof - exaggerated. So, imagine exaggeration exaggerated. Doesn’t make laugh, doesn't make clap. Yes, concept dark, comic wacky. Full points that. I wish subtle retained interest till end too.
