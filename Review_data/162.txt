Being kind really difficult. Neither considerate take whole lot effort. And trying put person's proverbial shoes end world. 7-year old Bokya reminds us goodness carry appreciate also forget age. Like Aesop's fables, Jataka Tales, Panchatantra short stories grown with. Dilip Prabhavalkar's Bokya Satbande falls category many kids understand Marathi. It amazing saccharine character like Bokya made believable. Every time I saw say something sounded bit wise age, I could picture one kids showering knowledge using similar language. Though wouldn't necessarily thoughtful times good-naturedly scheming get want. And yet overt, unbelievable melodrama makes way climax. And trying ever sticks sorely. Interestingly none actors wow-what-a-great job, make characters immensely adorable. Little Aryan adopts unique combination mischief maturity absolutely endearing. And see parents, brother, grandmother knowingly willingly giving manipulation. Oddly enough, Dilip Prabhavalkar written books, TV series screenplay film came across over-doing bit. While I found overacting extremely annoying, seemed intentional act made every kid house laugh. What makes film enjoyable, childish sort-of way smart. It doesn't let kid go bounds make actions seem unjustifiable. Bokya naughty don't see behave irresponsibly. Even cover-up something doesn't want parents know, see confide grandmother. Some lines entertain much enlighten. There off-handish remarks seem funny comment society today without sarcastic. In movies portray someone overly-good, many time "other" party painted dark, dark black. There's attempt underhandedly highlight former's brightness here. And aren't character transformations "good" guy's preaching. This must watch kids - Marathi-speaking not. Language won't barrier understand humanity. I took couple 7-year old non-Marathi-understanding kids absolutely loved it. They wouldn't stop yelling 'Boooookya Satbande' couple hours film. And well...I wonâ€™t shy away saying I enjoyed almost much too.
