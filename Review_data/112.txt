It since film made smell earthen floor hut, tulsi (holy basil) courtyard, fragrance rises spill water soil dry, hot land. Baboo Band Baaja isn’t first film set rural Maharashtra, one films leave hurry, matter many Housefulls Golmaals I watch along way. A poignant, touching tale simple family, Baboo Band Baaja made kind honesty sincerity rare find Indian cinema today. Jaggu man runs band plays every occasion village, funeral marriage. A band named son, Baboo. Baboo’s mother odd jobs living big dreams son – wants educate best possible manner, odds. But circumstances can’t even afford buy school uniform. Jaggu, hand, believes son take band, since men family generations. Stuck middle Baboo, bright little kid always thrown class reason other. The film essentially story cards life deals troubled family cope them. The striking aspect film lead cast. Milind Shinde Jaggu, Vivek Chabukswar little Baboo Mitali Jagtap Varadkar mother play parts well that, first time many years, I forgot I watching film. The connect characters, joys, sorrows, lives felt real lights came on, first interval end, felt like jolt back reality. No wonder Mitali young Vivek won National Awards performances film. Director, Pinjani deserves full marks treating film way has. When making film like this, easy get over-indulgent. But Rajesh Pinjani keeps form indulgence minimum, letting village setting spontaneity cast talking instead. Also, special mention must go editor film, Santosh Gothoskar. There one thing I say – edited film love. Baboo Band Baaja really little nuances life director chooses show – love mother child, frustrated existence man resigned fact neither son ever rise financial problems, spirited grandmother warms heart every time protects little child thrashing, pride mother feels son recites tables 2. Every little scene evokes little bit warmth, little bit sorrow, whole lot wonder choices debutante director makes journey film. Baboo Band Baaja manages take slice village life place audiences ordinarily subjected to, well, tripe. Like Deool, one films makes Marathi film industry proud. I hope enough screens showing film subtitles, audience limited people understand Marathi. Baboo Band Baaja film worth investing in, financially, emotionally well.
