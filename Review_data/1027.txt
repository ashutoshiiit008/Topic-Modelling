Let begin saying Vettaiyadu Vilayadu Gautam Menon’s best work. Lauded making content-heavy “different” films, Menon pressuring reputation live to. This 2006 film starring Kamal Hassan seems like sequel hit film Kaakha Kaakha, similar theme portraying turbulences cop’s life. While I still think Minnale best film far, Vettaiyadu Vilayadu enthralling watch performances. Kamal Hassan plays tough, brutal courageous cop Raghavan, larger life courageous persona established first scenes single-handed tackles bunch criminals. Hassan Raghavan kind cop nothing escape, even though stereotypical portrayal, wouldn’t expect anything else coming Hassan. Almost like seeing SRK play passionate lover. The film carries forward series murders take place similar manner – slitting throats, brutally disfiguring young women. Raghavan takes personal interest case colleague (played Prakash Raj) Arogyaraj’s daughter Rani one deceased victims. After brilliant performance Prakash Raj grief-stricken father. Here see similarity Kaakha Kaakha, however since flashback follows short serves merely informatory scene. Interspersed this, Raghavan’s relationship Aradhna (Jyothika), girl meets hotel. They mellow, engaging chemistry film, Jyothika’s de-glam avatar brings beauty like never before. You get suitably engrossed conversations serves respite fast-paced goings film. Uptil point, thoroughly gripped film: calculating guesses cynical trying figure among people around Raghavan could really killer (you’ve seen enough thrillers know killer always someone knew saw film). However, halfway film killer revealed simply put, disappointed. I won’t say where, I kept wondering I disappointed choice villain, whether revealed much early film. The thrilling chase Raghavan killer becomes predictable largely one-dimensional. You know exactly climax going be, times predictability gets viewer, easily distracted Hassan’s screen presence. With muscle (some fat too) brute, over-powering presence convinces scenes nonetheless. Mostly can’t take eyes him. The DVD film separate compilation songs film additional features. Music trademark pathway success Gautam Menon films; however music Vettaiyadu Vilayadu Harris Jayaraj mostly confusing – it’s neither assortment overtly westernized beats traditional melodies culturally relevant lyrics. This quite pity Jayaraj-Menon combination worked extremely well past (Kaakha Kaakha Minnale). I’ve always held notion Gautam Menon’s films don’t age particularly well focuses much considered current contemporary: background score/music, dialogues structure. It would better film stuck age-old tried tested structure murder-suspense. Watch Vettaiyadu Vilayadu however, want blown mind film moments; best manifested Jyothika Kamal Hassan’s connection performances. It makes perfect late-night indulgence film.
