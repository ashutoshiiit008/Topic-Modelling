When I start writing opinion film, I usually close eyes looking one thought wholesome description film. In cases, actor's name deal, film doesn't substantial plot. It would fall apart actor playing said character. This doesn't hold true Paa. The first thought last one Amitabh Bachchan Amitabh Bachchan only. But comes extremely valuable audience's experience core film. Sure, many aspects pertaining challenges single parent faces managing child rare disease. But, enough nuances touched upon make viewing worthwhile. That is, performance gratifying enough. My apprehension film entire become Amitabh Bachchan, star real life father-son relationship equally worse, combination both. I'm glad apprehensions absolutely uncalled for. You realize Auro Amitabh Bachchan make think it. Else wouldn't even realize him. Of course, lot due make-up artiste. Any talk film without salute make-up person costume designer would complete disregard art forms. And yet, none would enough wasn't stooped shoulder, expressive eyes, quivering lips, on. Now, piece becomes essay Big B, let's move aspects film. You cannot refrain nodding head approval portrayal politics even mostly over-idealistic. Amitabh's performance along Vidya Balan's elegant composure completely overshadows Abhishek Bachchan's depiction young, dynamic politician badly need. And despite dealing heavy topics these, entire film light tone, right end. Every time going gets little serious, little Auro, something hilariously spontaneous say - like children always do. Then things over-simplified. Like overall compassion people ages backgrounds treat abnormal child. Also, social acceptance illegitimate child mother tad uneasy digest. It obvious issues intentionally left equation help focus characters relationships. But issues conspicuous absence. Similarly, whole comment parents' complete disregard anything creative source living bad taste. A wee bit exaggerated was, order get extra laughs. Also, maturity 12-13 year olds show seems bit beyond age. The climax seems little melodramatic compared tone rest film. Usually, films deal topics varied politics rare genetic conditions leave feeling 2 different films, one blended two together well. Or interesting enough don't mind seeing one go. It almost two burning issues R. Balki wanted talk one film in. At least, Paa documents state media current affairs country naughts. For longest time now, I've waiting Amitabh film I really enjoyed. Finally, it's here. I wouldn't want adjoin superlatives performance challenges must faced getting right, I would want go find yourself. Yes, thereâ€¦go get tickets family!
