Half hour movie, I amazed well I knew dozen-odd characters. This achieved characters saying things small sub-plot. Pretty impressive, didn't go mundane voiceover route. Unfortunately though, characters continue thing next hour half too. Movies like exist neither shock entertain thrill provide relief daily grind. They made someone thought people hear story. Almost characters gray exist know - judge feel for. Since going slow, I lot time pay attention things "object" camera, he/she saying/doing. Especially, since anything new say/do while. The background stood out. The narrative set crowded set buildings - Bow Barracks. There constant changing noise (children playing, people cooking, etc) background adds flavor scene. The messy rooms reflected personalities occupants. Though raise question organization-crazy mind - none really care sort orderliness?! Oh well... I also enjoyed picturization songs. The style similar songs - shots singer singing, interspersed happenings Bow Barracks. It engaging, nevertheless, mainly singer different every time brought his/her style nuances screen. The camera purposefully moves, style different way rest movie picturized, give slightest video album touch. Unfortunately, screenplay dialogues make drag watch. Thirty minutes shorter movie would improve counts, inevitably repetitive lines would see door. So, kind something needs happen every minute, movie absolute definable purpose - please don't bother. But you, ignore flaws focus characters - wait movie DVD rent not-so-light mood. Parental warning! Loads profanity sexual content. Moderate violence.
