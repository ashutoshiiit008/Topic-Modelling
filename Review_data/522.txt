You know lists newspapers recommend Teacher’s Day? ‘Films based role teachers’, etc., mention films To Sir With Love, Black, Karate Kid, etc. Well, add new film list - em>The King’s Speech. It’s heartwarming, feel-good movie king resorting ordinary man’s help overcome speech disability, deliver important speech countrymen. It’s I call ‘pure gentleman’s film’, steeped British royalty, since concerns Duke York (Colin Firth Oscar winning performance) Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter, gentle, kind determined wife). Right background score, sets, wry humor knighthood, psychological divide royalty masses - typically British film, I’ve seen recent times. (The Queen last gem, comes mind.) The film works performances, witty writing character improvisations. Colin Firth outstanding, speech therapist, Lionel (played Geoffrey Rush). On paper, Lionel’s character certainly far interesting established scenes screenplay allows stand ground treat Duke student / patient, royalty needs watch manners. Writer David Seidler uses Lionel transform Duke deserving King speak mind, also make subtle commentary ridiculous customs monarchy, values outstayed welcome 21st Century. The remarkable quality writing despite based true story World War, Lionel’s approach dealing royalty seems extremely contemporary, rooted current times. A special word cinematographer Danny Cohen’s characteristic wide angles used consistently throughout film. And special word is, marvellous. It’s spectacular camerawork adapts Duke’s speech correction - beginning, wide angles almost bloat head every time facing camera, sign losing mind, frustration stammering habit exposed public. As embraces Lionel’s controversial methods treatment, wide angles slowly disappear begin see King, chin up. It Colin Firth’s film, throughout. He convincing cat caught tongue, transition embarrassed, nervous wreck, man forges bond Lionel becomes worthy ownership throne, classic. Mid-way film, I thanked stars (and tongue) realisation dawned speech, oratory skills language core greatest resistances revolutions history. And continue so. The King’s Speech undoubtedly great film, I think something HAVE watch big screen. I usually prefer films require pause crunching popcorn, I hear dialogue clearly. A deserving big screen watch film element action, music, adventure fantasy, makes experience immersive. The King’s Speech, largely filmed indoors, doesn’t present attributes - therefore, view, command compulsive viewing theatres, especially near-empty ones playing at, on-going World Cup season. I suspect original DVD may release soon - banking Oscar acclaim - could far holistic experience, rounding behind scenes how-did-you-pull-it-off interviews Colin Firth. But I conclude, I must address crucial question: Did film deserve epitome Oscar glory year? My answer firm no. Not good film - raises many chuckle, mostly tongue-in-cheek, never WOW. The Social Network, Inception, Black Swan films make us go WOW, many occasions even make us cringe seats, shield eyes importantly, forget there’s popcorn Coke armrest. That’s immersive, true sense.
