David Fincher known films tend ruminative, bleak inquiries human condition, seen eyes chief protagonist. His earlier Seven Fight Club starred Brad Pitt extremely grim. Here teams writer Eric Roth (of Forrest Gump fame) Brad Pitt The Curious Case Benjamin Button gives us film parts hopeful uplifting, respect take life living. One essential feature human capacity reflect lives; try hard make sense chaos experience. We bound Time; born young inexorably doomed age, die. That something cannot defeat. One tends visualize life journey; journey acquire companions lose them, knowing fully well would come time would lost others too. But happened reverse? Just supposing one born old; journey would start old age end baby hood. This would provide us completely different perspective; would born looking world eyes old rheumy die cradle. This angle film adopts, director writer use outlook fashion story chief character’s (Benjamin Button) life. The similarities Forrest Gump immediately obvious; Benjamin born debilitating physical condition, woman remains love life, moves well defined time periods American History, tries make sense process gives pithy sayings life. The key difference Forrest Gump, History one main characters, Gump existed prop History; History given short shrift (though constantly aware addendum frame). The movie cheesy either (remember line life box chocolates Forrest Gump?), instead comes across rather detailed portrait Benjamin Button. The movie three stages: Benjamin’s childhood, coming age leaves home learn trade, eventual return death. Brad Pitt Benjamin Button portrayal satisfactory Special effects technologies employed transform Brad Pitt's physical appearance various stages film. The special effects well done, including makeup face skin, blend completely frame. But Pitt's acting somehow falls short; child Pitt nothing would demonstrate limitations body respect mental age. We see glimpses mischief, childlike curiosity barring couple fleeting scenes. But it, somehow tremendous opportunity reflect young child (mentally) trapped old aged body would respond completely lost. Benjamin Button’s character also comes across goody goody, nary bad bone body constantly polite clear heart. That something difficult digest, especially physical condition. We see signs frustration, irritation, anger; sweet angel throughout. Contrast Daniel Day Lewis’s performance My Left foot example. The supporting cast tremendous. Taraji Henson Queenie good Tilda Swinton Elizabeth Abott. The portrayal tugboat captain, Captain Mike, considers artist, Jared Harris brilliant. Cate Blanchett adequate throughout; looks particularly radiant plays younger Daisy. David Fincher maintains steady tempo sticks old fashioned story telling; sudden shifts time, fast cuts, handheld cameras either. The tale unfolds leisurely pace, packed incidents, hence pace flag. The period feel beautifully recreated; opening footage clock maker makes clock runs reverse, scenes Benjamin’s childhood old age home, meetings Elizabeth Abbott lobby Russian hotel, look feel natural. The movie seems suggest subversive message – old age bad growing younger something feared avoided. This complete contrast youth obsessed consumer culture prevalent today. The movie also possibly points old age childhood nearly – something Bard Avon also pointed quite centuries ago. This film flows gently; sudden surprises, fortuitous acts God either. Overall film rock solid without outstanding, definitely would want think lives dark comfort theatre.
