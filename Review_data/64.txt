How often seen Indian audience bank hopes director instead stars? From parents readers, voices turned excited soon realized Agent Vinod Johnny Gaddar guy. And it's like stars Saif Ali Khan Kareena Kapoor disliked scoffed at. Hence, resist disappointment director/writer jeer, mock-cheer, tch-tch-tch ultimately slap forehead despair Agent Vinod progresses towards regression. You sense director, Sriram Raghavan's discomfort extra money - like person uneasy among hoity-toity, snotty people, would page-3 event. For know, Raghavan's original story, like earlier ones, might set Mumbai, Pune, Goa Delhi. But, well, would extra money? So, let's make RDX nuclear bomb voila, Morrocco, London, works. We still money left. Hmmm...songs, let's songs. A lavish 'mujra' scintillating mix color light Gothic set trick. Sure, could call pressures commercializing product. But, I'd like give Raghavan little credit that. I think he's smart enough know doesn't need commercialize product. He brand. But, oh well. Who said intelligent person confident handling money? The sign things might right show first sequence. A quote The Good, The Bad The Ugly cuts scene feels like right film. Is spoof? Is tribute? No, it's desert Afghanistan. Should smile reference, engage tortured RAW agent? Thankfully, soon followed slickly choreographed action sequence. But confused genres show feel reassured mind-blowing action look forward to. Like half-decent thriller, Agent Vinod fools you, leads on, makes feel smart characters smile weird smile tells upto something, throws face tattoo musical instrument-cum-weapon ought remember. But juncture, Agent Vinod leaves loophole waiting answered. Whatever made sense, left house interval. The last 30 minutes feels like another film started first one ridiculous finish. The climax climax made angry. Did even realize implying agent India's intelligence agency did?! People know nothing national security would come solution like drinks down. That besides saving wise-cracks, writing way many distractions, story, screenplay characters. For example, every film referenced, Don original Agent Vinod Charlie Chaplin, taken away mystery Agent Vinod trying solve. So eager Sriram Raghavan make reverent tributes didn't realize deviating genre. (Oh, I'd loved way paid respect Anand Johnny Gaddar!) Then, throughout film, characters introduced either killed turn undercover terrorist/agent. I'd love psychoanalyst analyze Agent Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) - he's confused childhood memory; switches aware human gut-feeling insensitive man's man. But then, would mean psychoanalyst I would spending time character writers. Similarly, Irma (Kareena Kapoor) introduced doctor aide terrorist takes refuge soon sees capable man around. The way became pitiable woman drop hat, instant I doubted myself. I wondered whether I'd misunderstood supposed either international agent terrorist. The chemistry Agent Vinod Irma dropped pillow talk Saif Ali Khan Kareena Kapoor. No people, need get excited. It's kind pillow talk put bed. No single character stay long enough make impact engage except Adil Hussain elegant terror him. Ravi Kissen Ram Kapoor fun-type quirky characters, Prem Chopra annoying caricature. For kind terrorist proposed be, seemed weirdly compliant. Others like B P Singh Mariyam annoying accent delivery style consider anything else. And blink-and-miss cameos too. I realize I'm tipping heavy story characterization action film. But lot Sriram Raghavan product. I know smart style narrating story, troubles like action film, especially since wide range Hollywood franchises choose from. Also, somehow Agent Vinod it, doesn't look real Bond, Hunt Bourne. It might impression MI6 capable RAW. Throughout film, I marveled different sound film feet tapped background score continuously. But, add story's character? It felt like background music different trip altogether. Similarly, sure, camerawork, editing action sequences state-of-art seemed like different department necessarily congruent story. Parts added together, certainly. But make film whole? Again, songs, 'Raabta' 'khoya khoya chand' Shaitan. And I can't thank decision-makers enough 'Pungi' part film, I'd liked say nicer things rather didn't.
