It strong movie leave impression even 21 hours passed since movie got over. Even strongest urge yell makers movie asking them, "WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?" The love drab unengaging could be. 2050 looks appealing 5 seconds. And story talking here? I need explanation. How movie set 2050 song every 15 minutes? The phenomenon reduced last years. Are going full circle? At least, I hope then, we'll "ignore" button lurking around somewhere pressed whenever chords play together name music. At least, maybe songs played together interval. What bliss! In queue coffee instead listening lulling music would hate get from. Anyway, time travel made twist gray cells ways unknown them. But, actually manage make boring showing us 48 years now, we'd hologram irritate us shopping, product placements going get worse. I actually enough time amidst super-slow proceedings actually pray I'd 2050. To honest, I hadn't gone major expectations story. I hoping many firsts far technical wizardry Hindi cinema goes. Zilch. I thought sci-fi movie would mean mind-boggling action. There action, 'mind-numbing' would describe better. I intrigued decision open Dalip Tahil random woman playing secretary, relevance rest story. I shocked pace first minutes action movie. I revised expectations right there. Who said action movies move fast pace? They defying narrative style genre, walk towards slamming door 15 minutes. Yet, I couldn't help smirking fluttering animated butterfly. The smirk turned eye-roll second time, 'no way' third exasperated helplessness overtook that. When script loose...did I call something non-existent 'loose'?...anyway, script such, I think unfair judge performances. Lousy lines cannot make even best actors woo audience. Yet, Priyanka Chopra relatively decent job portraying duality two characters. I seriously don't want make call Harman Baweja yet. The Baweja family must poured heart one, I see brickbats coming way. For story that, according director's note official site, conceived 9 years ago, way movie shot felt superficial. Throughout I got feel location stunt chosen story less woven around that. Also, I think disproportionate amount spent marketing blamed. Had created hype, shock watching bad movie might softened. On hand, created movie random logic, goofed-up concept, fake romance, token villain (geez) and....aah late wishful thoughts! You know silver lining though? Poverty eradicated 42 years - I couldn't spot Dharavi Mumbai (the largest slum city). Three cheers one!
