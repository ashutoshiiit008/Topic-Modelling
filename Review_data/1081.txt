So that’s feels. A screen playing Marathi film packed capacity, audience hooting cheering first show day release. Twenty years Tatya Vinchu terrified Lakshya (and audience) sheer audacity existence, he’s back, time third dimension tow. Despite unabashed fan original film, I reminded I 8 I watched first. I walked theatre time, palm ready, far face. Yes, I must confess, I expecting ‘facepalm’. For uninitiated, twenty years back, dreaded gangster Tatya Vinchu, quest immortality, transferred soul doll dying moments help spell taught Baba Chamatkar. The doll, owned ventriloquist Lakshmikant alias Lakshya, wreaks havoc ultimately shot Inspector Mahesh Jadhav. Sounds ridiculous? Well, watched film came out, you’d know much fun film was, despite corn-and-cheese. Surprisingly, despite predictable buffoonery, continuous madcap comic horror (if thing) absence late Lakshmikant Berde – one half soul earlier film (pun unintended) - Zapatlela 2 makes fun children’s film, especially audience children original film came out. Yes, silly film rarely pretends anything but. However, sometimes, sometimes, hackneyed phrase, ‘leave brains home’, genuinely comes handy. My palm face, then, rarely met film, did, genuine indulgent fun. This time round, Tatya Vinchu hunting Lakshmikant’s son Aditya, grown become mechanical engineer, heart hearts wants ventriloquist like father. Aditya, course, blissfully unaware events twenty years ago. Really, I cannot emphasize much reaction film depends whether fan original film not. That ragtag doll voiced legendary Dilip Prabhavalkar took personality own, engraving memory. The doll looks freakishly same, moronic expression face still ability strike comedy-tinged terror heart. Zapatlela 2 works extent, spite virtually plot number pointless subplots revolving around ventriloquist, guard, lady journalist romantic track involving Aditya; works relentless physical comedy. Also, Adinath Kothare, son director Mahesh Kothare, fine job Aditya. Mahesh Kothare reprises role Mahesh Jadhav, Commissioner, well. Again, cherry-on-top menacing return doll, voiced Dilip Prabhavalkar. He’s still angry bloodthirsty, he’s still capable taking full-grown men ease. The doll animation marginally better time, even wasn’t, would least concerns film. Also, I quite surprised notice makers haven’t compromised technique here. The film fairly well-executed, manner shot cut. And you’re going enjoy ludicrousness, may well enjoy shameless exploitation third dimension. Objects thrust thrown alarming frequency, I could hear children cinema hall particularly enjoying experience. Let’s clear; Zapatlela 2 fanboys fangirls, children, bound good time. Take along ride Tatya Vinchu won’t let forget. If don’t fall category, you’ve always got palm face.
