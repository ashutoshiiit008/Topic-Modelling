Gangster Noir. Coppola Scorsese showed us it’s done. Tarantino turned head. And every Hollywood director comes along screws up, sending us running back masters solace. For reason, I expected writer-director Andrew Dominik’s latest film, Killing Them Softly belong latter category. My expectations dove south prominent director, maker one year’s loved talked-about Hindi films, tweeted saying one boring films seen. How glad I I watched film anyway. Killing Them Softly easily one sharpest, smartest-written films year. Dialogue-heavy, yes, point film get boring. Also, film one best-ever endings seen recent times. Two small-time thugs, played excellently Scoot McNairy Ben Mendelsohn, attempt heist little station – robbing poker game involving mafia - older operator manages convince someone else would take fall it. The amateurs, however, don’t know they’ve gotten into. A professional mob enforcer, hitman – Brad Pitt, dressed black, effortlessly ‘cool’ - roped Big Guys look matter bring perpetrators book, speak. The razor-sharp dialogue, mostly tongue-in-cheek, manages keep long character interactions interesting times. And every comes action set-piece make jaw drop. Interestingly, film’s timeline runs Barack Obama - George W. Bush Presidential race, run-up Obama eventually elected President United States America. What give every character every line context. So generous talk recession hitting even mob business, falling rates pro-assassins hard times course, fact US, ultimately money. What film really gets right feel it. The frames aren’t picture perfect; meant gritty. Every shot film primarily set create mood. The cool eventually oozes by-product good actors delivering great lines without making go top. Brad Pitt first-rate ice-cold, no-nonsense hitman roped mob look issue heist. It kind role harnesses Pitt’s natural charm, deadpan expression goes well uber-cool look. He makes late-ish entry film, larger-than-life persona largely kept check, doesn’t come looking like ‘hero’ film. James Gandolfini expensive hitman out-of-town, well past prime alchohol-and-hooker addiction excellent well. Also good see Ray Liotta gangster runs poker game eventually gets robbed amateurs. However, easy understand director I mentioned earlier didn’t like film. Indeed, like him. And you’ll know first ten minutes film going work not. Right word go, lines mouthed characters sharp quips meant evoke certain amount quiet mirth. If aren’t smiling coolth beginning film, little else going like apart well-shot action portions, number case. But drawn start, kind film would itching watch again.
