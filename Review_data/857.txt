It'd safe say five people showed screening I at, least 4 Naseeruddin Shah. And cheat turned be. Not I surprised. And actually, tone talking seconds screen, I thankful wasn't him. The film otherwise, pretty much see trailers. There people can't sleep whatever reason. There people sleep well "bonding" one latter group sleep behalf one former group relieving stress. As told (again trailer itself) someone sleeps sleep, also going dream dreams. There's new knowledge beyond that, characters barely anything new knowledge other. Obviously, dreams makes bulk Sona Spa would boring film dreams weren't deep dark secrets sleepless people. Now, people don't sleep dream people sleeping dream dream, minor technicality thus addressed all. Even so, interesting premise psychoanalysis! The original person's dream representation deepest desires/insecurities. The dream though real sleep-worker believe true. But, none explored all. Instead get superficial philosophical talk using lines supposed sound profound. Except Nivedita Bhattacharya (Meenakshi), Aahana Kumrah (Ritu) guy plays Sachin (Indira's brother) actors mostly stiff three mentioned better comparison. Pooja Pradhan (Indira) actually looks like she's held together make-up plastered face. In fact, cinematography grainy see smallest pore everyone's face. I don't know artistic purpose serves, even real life cannot see face gruesome detail. If saw even fraction detail coming stories insomniacs complete. Or least they'd meaning viewer, even meaning wasn't deciphered understood completely. Watching Sona Spa like 15-20 minute boring dream played repeat two hours. I really wonder Sona Spa would've turned short.
