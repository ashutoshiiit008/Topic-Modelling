The last thing you'd expect movie interesting trailer wouldn't move ahead there. You rejoice 20 minutes almost everything knew story beforehand covered two hours fun look forward to. And nothing happens. If weren't one-liners sprinkled couple decent performances, Ghanchakkar would've complete disappointment. The movie lingers much. It stays situations little long peak situation; dialogue repeats little made impact; many points lines come second two late. By done dusted prediction going happen pretty much always hit bull's eye. Including, final twist. For content has, Ghanchakkar good 30-45 minutes long. The thing keeps going couple performances. Vidya Balan carries weight ridiculous outfits ease, can. It hilarious character, Neetu's sense dressing mocked defends pride. Even weight commented upon. However, timing go couple comic scenes towards end mostly shrieking. Her accent inconsistent. Yet, every time goes "Hain?" laugh. Namit Das Idris perfect timing one-liners. Unfortunately, handed slapsticky sexual humor doesn't quite work. Emraan Hashmi Rajesh Sharma's roles don't need much variation expressions stick required them. Also, characters stay good arm's distance away aren't really given chance get involved them. It gets insufferable while. There much Rajesh Sharma Namit Das' shrugged-shoulder-laughter find funny. There much - "Where's money?" "I don't remember. I've lost memory." "Liar! I'll kill you/your wife." - take. The basic premise, three guys loot bank, one supposed keep money safe supposedly lost memory, really interesting. But nothing done that. To spice they've added quirks like goons using local train compartment rendezvous commuter carrying vegetables. But that's come across - quirks forced in. They go flow film. The Aamir-esque threatening caller phone doesn't add much fear. There possibility look husband-wife relationship falls apart illness and/or money, dealt rather superficially. This purported comic thriller never thrills funny intermittently. Even don't compare expectations promo material sets up, you'd end disappointed Ghanchakkar.
