We Are Family...hmmm name still gave creeps I entered theater. Shrugging off, I settled cushy, melodramatic, soap opera - English version I've seen. I wondered I walked out, "Does one well-made teary scene, warrant 'good' opinion?" I didn't heart write-off film thousand flaws managed one scene touched written, performed directed well. Even emotion way I identified situation, "Oh God! What I'm dying I tell kids it?" boo-hoo-hoooo-tissue-please Ok, done 'credit it's due bit', I feel liberated let 'ripping apart' begin! We'll start soft, like film. It mature concept big picture actually non-standard considering typical Hindi family stories. When start watching Stepmom feel like started reading book middle chapter. We Are Family sort-of covers gap gives rounded beginning. Also, missing backstory three main leads, Stepmom, provided briefly. And short one two line descriptions work perfectly. And stage set fine melodrama...or not. The performances aren't I feared - shrieks shrills over-the-top. But fail move get interested, let alone involved. Mom-type Kajol; strong yet unsure, Kareena Kapoor hunk dad Arjun Rampal show dilemma struggle, none make don't feel them. Maybe characters flaws necessarily good human beings. But bad enough hate. Awesome gray characters I've always waiting for, still seem book, real human beings. And difficult point exactly didn't work writing execution three characters. The kids hand pretty much caricatures plucked one filmy stereotype another. Actually, I got wrong. Not three designed way. The little boy, absolutely nothing do. His middle name might well been, 'Haven't clue I exist.' The writer's cluelessness transcends barriers fourth wall haunt audience. I don't think attempt make film's events unpredictable. The trailer gives away main elements film way dialogue, sequences, songs make-up. Moreover, would one watch We Are Family instead Stepmom? There hardly value addition Indianization. Unless count making 3 kids instead 2 "kangan" (bangle) scene. Oops! How could I forget allude idea woman's ultimate aim life get married. And directly go say mother comes XX chromosome! Without getting argument modern woman versus traditional idea woman's role society, I'd like say concepts rather regressive. Not mention two women were/are love guy shown dancing together. I mean, I'm sure many women who'd get along way, wasn't convincing enough. The concept We Are Familyconstantly reminded I remember beautiful film, Mere Baad Rakhee Gulzar plays mom four kids. It's soul-touching film goes looking foster parents kids she's diagnosed fatal disease. No, We Are Family nowhere close sensitive, I suddenly feel like digging one out. Any pointers start?
