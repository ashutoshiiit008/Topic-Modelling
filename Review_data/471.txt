A Jail - subject matter grim treatment depressing. You see characters it’s jail adds, deletes depletes defined thus far. Parag (Niel Nitin Mukesh) one care for, want get jail. And that, sucked in; atmosphere, living one day time - sometimes hopeful, days aimless. And want avoid acknowledging creepy feeling - real life prisons must worse. And Parag turns narrator see essay eyes. The plot moves life does. What shown mostly know already. And yet must seen small percentage really goes barracks. We don't see boredom prisoner must gone through. Why care? They ones defecated society. We live fear. They might well rot fullest sent hell. But then, also ones repent, one-time offenders, … innocent - yet put trial worse - proven guilty. You also introduced inmates jails - policemen in-charge. What thankless job is!? What crime commit forced spend days nights worst humanity offers? Let alone day-to-day problems face higher ups, judicial system, politicians family. Yes, Madhur Bhandarkar taken upon sensitize audience plight people live world know exists choose ignore. He matter-of-fact tone. He doesn't sermonize, doesn't glamorize. He opens door ironically lets so. Writer Madhur, chosen one representative set people constitute Indian jail. He doesn't necessarily fill flesh detail, there's enough us make fair judgment characters. Parag doesn't say much. But even don’t take account acting skills used, there's lot writing tells him. There characters narrating similar feelings know he's thinking. It extremely well-woven narrative. There actually one main character film. And it's risky - banking one actor, even lady lead stride alongside. The bet worked. You don't miss detailed characters. His misery, hope enough agonize 2 hours. Manoj Bajpai bonus. The two show silence convey. The plot cannot broken introduction, conflict, climax. The first last parts way short. In fact climax seems simple quick. The pace suddenly changes ends almost abruptly. But, even so, there's preaching, there's epilogue. And must difficult-to-resist temptation. This autobiography prison. Not one prisoner two. But it’s peek years jail's life. Inmates come inmates go. You see it, smell it, sense it. Parag's misfortune - wrong place, wrong time, wrong person - incidental. But thinking constantly people represents - innocent.
