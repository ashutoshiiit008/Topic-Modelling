Happy New Year "buy one get two free" film. You promised heist, get revenge drama underdog film free. And imagine Hindi film three story films none pressing hard romantic angle. And I worried Happy New Year wouldn't story la Tees Maar Khan. But hey, I'd take 3 predictable stories compared none day. It isn't surprising film 10 seconds short three hours. Indeed, I dreading movie even started look runtime. One would thought movies length aren't made more. And yet, movie didn't feel long. Though I don't know takes credit that. Was movie really engaging patience general mental readiness movies belonging brand Khan improved mile more? For better worse, case may be, movie slackens rarely. That didn't make story less predictable. Granted, writers try hard keep suspense on, given genre film festive season know film headed even you've seen film. Sure, every self-referencing, lame joke tiny twist wouldn't expect Farah Khan film. For every random reference one film another tongue-in-cheek remark pop culture current trends winking you. For every time sole lady film put characters little detail catches attention. Unfortunately, cases, annoying outweighs surprising, leaving state good surprise can't overcome banality rest film. Happy New Year takes shot "realness" reality shows. It laughs films kind, Farah Khan films usually do, time wasn't wearing "we like only" sleeve "something needs fixed" attitude. Hats Anurag Kashyap Vishal Dadlani sporting spirit, cheap meh cameo came across as. Who would've thought there'd film Anurag Kashyap overacts Shah Rukh Khan even intentionally so. In fact, actors, expected again, overact. But, it's cringe inducing overact. It's kind tries shove fact performance throat. The kind tries make every moment dramatic impactful. Yet, characters gets one scene see glimpse actor really capable of. Making seem powerful acting must easiest kind do. Especially likes Boman Irani Abhishek Bachchan. Shah Rukh Khan comes across even narcissistic usual (especially end credits). Sonu Sood treated like newbie gotten chance show six-pack, except cannot overdo Shah Rukh Khan's ten. The manner Deepika Padukone's character Mohini put treated shabbiest all. That doesn't leave insult insult, came across one things movie trying satirical about. I sure, I giving film little credit due though. Even so, Deepika Padukone one really shone film. Trying maintain dignity worst circumstances. The cannot said Abhishek Bachchan. I begun feel bad actor - really reduced levels side-flunkey whatever comes way, though capable lot more. Yet, comic timing, even worst jokes get cracking. In sense, cannot help giggle lot what's going film. At times, feels like watching Tom Jerry. At times innuendos, you'd rather film - bad taste, repetitive, new funny. Even so, I pleasantly surprised happy Happy New Year attempted story. Yes, expectedly lame laughable. But, isn't cool Farah Khan thinks audience worthy it. As nodding fact audiences tastes changing, even nod weary one change ever slow. Thank you, lady, I mean sincerely. This trend, makes hope one Diwali, far away, make look forward Shah Rukh Khan starrer, directed Farah Khan. Come Team Khans, it!
