We people want progress. We people disturbed section society wronged achieve progress. When comes 'our' progress, people don't mind collateral damage. Dibakar Banerjee's Shanghai, portrays aspirations people want 'progressive' nation. A deep concept, multi-layered connotations meaningful characters starts seeming half-baked post half-time made utterly regular end. The age ol' nexus business, politics, law administration yet scratched left that. What 'realistic' eye ceases realistic brain teasing details references aren't otherwise used Hindi film. A guy 'good' side professor, rebel, fighting behalf wronged thing female students - that's aren't used Hindi film. A strong female protagonist whose father implicated multi-crore Rupee scam finds helpless, fallen married teacher, yet manages create empathy towards - that's aren't used Hindi film. A typical politician genuinely believes concerned leader party, despite powerful right - that's aren't used Hindi film. For goodness sake, Emraan Hashmi whose acting capabilities explored - that's used Hindi film! And yet end come feeling writers tried pull wool eyes interesting departures came sham over-simplified climax. Some things pleasantly surprising. Sub-plots begin left without resolution; told things characters inter-relationships using subtlest details - apparent reason terms story - things lend beauty film inherent chaos. Many time, Dibakar Banerjee chooses pause, take breather, gives extra moment take ambience moments strike chord audience characters. That characters played fine actors adds believability. That Abhay Deol could sleep-walked taken-for-granted senior bureaucrat struggling conscience means begun take acting skills granted. I wish though generic South Indian accent given pass. Emraan Hashmi, watch, I ain't elaborating cool see comfortable something regular zone. Kalki Koechlin gets repeat strong-lady-in-distress role. The smaller roles though ones really stick Shanghai. From Pitobash Tripathi kind screen presence Prosenjit Chatterjee Supriya Pathak whose omnipresence felt throughout despite really short roles Farouque Shaikh whose presence strangely comforting even Anant Jog plays one representatives people wronged manipulated politicians. The problem comes back cop-out climax, one build towards really well. And details seem place. For example, satire lyrics 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' sound like it'll sung protestors rather supporters ruling party. Yet, interesting, fairly relatable characters staged familiar stage - corruption, red-tape dishonesty. A system I frustratingly trapped want see characters wade see light ourselves. But realistic milieu thrown reality - still fiction life obviously going easy characters. It boils - makes movie good you? What ok letting go off, rest got hooked? If looking serious, no-nonsense drama, Shanghai you. But, end disappointed build-up towards climax remains unsatiated, come upset feeling. You know I am.
