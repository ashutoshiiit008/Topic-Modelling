Mausam like pleasant evening breeze - enjoy bit fall asleep. Which extremely sad, see labour love frame. It's pretty every corner. But, love story unfortunately goes like battery advert. Fine, I didnâ€™t fall asleep that's I don't believe sleeping films, especially ones I'm reviewing. But, I could completely imagine someone dozing bit, guess wouldn't missed much woke up. Ironically, eased-out pace Mausam starts with, bit that's charming story. It's pretty, serene, simple high expectations set drama unfold. I enjoyed leisurely life village cute sense humor. But maybe, like life village, story doesn't move. The characters move on, problems state mind remain same. Which fine, that's happens love. But, I'd enjoy love story, I lose connection love Harry (Shahid Kapoor) Aayat (Sonam Kapoor). And enough, "aawwww, sweet" moments first half hour. I also admired "sarson de khet" (mustard farms) I've fed 15 years, felt fresh way captured. The straight lines railway tracks electrical poles formed; curves bumpy paths underground water pipes lying around said "sarso de khet" formed - painstakingly framed. In fact, except tacky video-game-ish air-attack sequence, Mausam beautifully shot. But, sweetness relationship cinematography film take far. Of course, value getting exasperated along characters' frustrations. But, translates irritation film itself. Not if, love story, forced say, "true love ok, make meet get done already!" And it's like writers haven't put distractions along way. There enough them. And I'm talking energetic songs make feel like watch Shahid Kapoor dance forever. There historical political context within lead pair struggles. Politics I witnessed. Times horrific memories of. We should've gotten involved, should've rooted lead pair. We don't. This despite fact see least one two beautiful people frame screen. I didn't quite get Harry went rigid. I almost going blame Shahid Kapoor able carry "serious" facet Harry, soon realized Harry lost charm vigor. Sonam Kapoor hand maintains status quo throughout film. In fact, expressions carry forward debut film, Saawariya. A love story Hindu boy Muslim girl minus parents usually raise hell. The lovers' bad luck keeps getting worse hatred around won't let together. Hatred isn't even directly linked lives. The tragedy rather poetic, that, two want live time space oblivion separated geography timeline. But poetry boring.
