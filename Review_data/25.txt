“Well, let's say I like live dangerously.” – Tommy Plympton As end credits 22 Female Kottayam roll, first credit appears reads ‘Filmography’, lists three films ’22 Female’ inspired from. While two three films would make all-time favourite lists, even films special would see similarities films share. Naming films, course, would thorough disservice yet watch 22 Female Kottayam. Tessa K. Abraham Malayali nurse living working Bangalore, looking settle Canada. In quest visa, meets Cyril, man runs visa agency. With school-boyish charm earnestness, Cyril wins Tessa love blossoms. But stories never end boy girl fall love, they? While 22 Female Kottayam thriller, appreciated core engaging fiction story, really needs lauded treatment. Director Aashiq Abu, course narrating tale, shows rare insight life young, city-bred woman living cosmopolis India. Women check man’s posterior, don’t fear revealing aren’t virgins getting relationship, young women get relationships convenience older, married men. All these, more, truths notions morality affecting them, majority India yet come terms even real life. Cinema, then, still distance away. But Aashiq Abu writers weave story around facets life, therein lies truth behind 22 Female Kottayam hailed path-breaking film. The film however, far perfect. Both halves film starkly different other, though one see makers tried let side story build slowly, fact remains film tends sag. There long stretches devoted establishing re-establishing established, rather carrying story forward. And repeats throughout film. Had film pruned 20 minutes so, could possibly impactful. Rima Kallingal, plays Tessa, mysterious presence always smouldering surface. She looks convincing throughout, even though isn’t naturally blessed acting mettle pull complex character portrays. She manages hold film up, needs lauded. However, I couldn’t help wonder film would turned better competent actress played part. Fahad Fazil Cyril excellent. He isn’t typical Malayalam film hero he’ll never able pull grand entrances Malayalam superstars make. Instead, like counter-balance them. Fahad Fazil could possibly poster boy new paths commercial Malayalam cinema seems treading. Prathap Pothen, rather pivotal role father figure Cyril makes mark. Where 22 Female Kottayam lacks music. A story like would served well one hooking piece music, one melody haunts viewer even hours left cinema hall, helps relive tale experienced. 22 Female Kottayam film appreciated better second viewing theatre, possibly miss repeat audiences lack enduring music. Still, twisted, engaging story effortlessly slick cinematography, film bound draw claps I heard end credits roll.
