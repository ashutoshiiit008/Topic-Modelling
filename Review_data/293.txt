The guilty pleasure summer here. Doug Liman's Edge Tomorrow much fun one sci-fi action flick starring Tom Cruise. Based Japanese novel titled 'All You Need Kill' (which also supposed title film while, current name settled upon), movie feels like mash-up number films, including Source Code, Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Independence Day even little bit 2013's Oblivion, also starring Cruise. In many ways, film also like equal opposite mirror image Oblivion. If film showed Earth vast, beautiful desolate canvas, one man one woman, Edge Tomorrow introduces us Earth frenzied ugly battleground; again, one man one woman centre all. With quite relentless pace, daringly sharp editing, terrific lead pair form Cruise gorgeous Emily Blunt, Edge Tomorrow makes engaging actioner; one makes gloss weaknesses smartly tackles rather outrageous story hand. US Army Major William Cage unexpectedly finds middle war Europe, invading alien race, reluctantly goes it, ends strangest predicaments - stuck time loop, wakes exact point everytime dies. The option continue living day again. One big question marks raised early film Cage made go war all. It never fully explained, time film get time question logic. Once he's middle it, pace film never lets pause ask questions. In time-loop scenarios, one biggest worries one faces audience reason time loop occurrence. Luckily, reason Edge Tomorrow satisfactory, also quite believable larger scheme things. And one big, intriguing mysteries film, something one ever answer to, many times William Cage actually live day? A hundred time? A thousand times? Even more? We can't tell, makes film much enigmatic, Cage one living day again. For rest world, end it, one day passed. The humorous undercurrent throughout film great help, terrifically staged action. Even though visually overwhelming tough follow (particularly 3D), film action film heart, sticks admirably. One miss truly impactful memorable background score, however, important film like this. Apart rampaging action sci-fi leanings, film also ultimately unsung heroes strange sort doomed love story. With big-scale films like Edge Tomorrow, emotions stay much film powerful music score go back to. Unfortunately, film's music purely functional. Cruise Blunt, course, rank among best things film. They react like firecrackers, pleasure see female character big action film get much scope perform action - almost much co-star. Edge Tomorrow taken cleaners one truly wants - films action sci-fi genra almost always torn apart logic. But sometimes film blatantly honest intentions, you're willing let way. Edge Tomorrow enjoyable film multiple times over; I suspect make fun repeat viewing well.
