Perdón , Hrithik Roshan fans. Really sorry, wait good Hrithik film got longer years. The setting beautiful cast. The beginning also makes eager. I completely bowled rugged necessary clueless look Hrithik wore opening sequence. And despite absolutely captivating cinematography. The standard set beginning really exciting. Hrithik trouble sandy deserts Nevada, don't know why. His voiceover introduces us small-time crook used strip Las Vegas. But, doesn't end well. I'm ok climax itself, getting like sedative. I won't say went downhill mode immediately first minutes. Dramatic editing crept twice, followed mandatory song boggling dance Hrithik-Boneless-Roshan. These hints warned take film seriously, despite obvious effort. And too. But, interval felt like came much earlier expected that's usually good sign. The pace perfect - romance lingered I could sense "aawww"; mini-twists came quick sharp jerks. And I really looking forward enjoyable fare. But must guessed story went. The thing is, cliché cliché language. It remains even sexiest accent. And continues bear character even sub-titled. The dialogue pretty much inane. And really cute moments others see attempt make "different", "typical" situations. Usually, premise film story, fact, set up. Like say, "What Indian boy meets Mexican girl?" And play around possibilities. But it's like esimerp (ok, sorry, bad one!). It's reverse engineered. Looks like first came marketing - Rs. passé, $ want - make sincerely believe bring Indian cinema world audience. Next, let's particular climax half-dozen ways romance end. Now let's play conflict-conflict. Eureka let's twist standard 2.5 degrees. Caste bar, money bar, religion bar, whole-freaking country bar. Let objecting parties third person's family! And let's chop situation situation whenever cannot get unreasonable. I shudder think shorter English version like. Though non-linear narration used style create interest, focus wrong place. The "what's happening now" much interesting "how got here". But, weightage given sections needed reversed. Also, twists come last half hour lame predictable due one-dimensional characters created. Kabir Bedi, Nick Brown Kangna Ranaut trying hard dysfunct. The "trying" part section cast stiff. Every emotion pretentious. And anyway, even feared villains story completely punctures anticipation. Hrithik Barbara Mori fair job. The thing look good, half work done right there. The rest stuff taken care tight close-ups. So, body language needs used. Some tight shots work really well. Eyes mating, excitement brewing couple, urge kept control unwillingly - come brilliantly. The kisses making done utmost comfort much needed skill Hindi films. On flip side, done give film international appeal? If so, that's pretty lame, they've there, done that. Literally figuratively - without "supposedly" Indian moral bindings undying love. Maybe that's crossover cinema about. snicker Kites super-slick production. Ace photography, definitely apt background music, intelligent editing, decent acting. I cannot take anything away fact outdone Love Story 2050, Blue Drona, terms hopes created high-budget visuals/effects actual product. Uhhh, but…story, por favor?
