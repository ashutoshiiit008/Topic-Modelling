After two weeks typical masala fare, anything "different" welcome. And that's exactly Madras Cafe - different - something hasn't tried often India; real-life incident recent history fictionalised put forth much realism possible; politics behind incident deciphered extent. For I admire makers investing time, money talent project. Yet, ultimately film, Madras Cafe's narration seemed like I narrating horrifying news item kids - simplified; episodic; brought level; without getting much detail yet pointing necessary elements. In treatment, Madras Cafe reminds numerous political thrillers Hollywood well-executed even pulsing drama. It keeps engaged, texture maintains beautifully throughout film, course, share loopholes. It assumes high regard certain position - case, substitutes President United States America ex-Prime Minister India. His importance stake scheme things given. There things worked drama though. For example, outset know outcome film. There nothing look forward terms turn events, nothing hope hope for. I couldn't help wonder film hadn't opened Vikram's (John Abraham) take things. I wonder build event would've different, I wonder would've better connect characters. Here someone know nothing remorse deadly political event part of. You given bit backstory nothing nationalism connect happenings. The moment Jaya (Nargis Fakhri) makes pretentious comment anti-nationalism, disconnect her. And one first lines film. Not much later film, yet I constantly looking way involved. The first half film narrated fervor completely engrossing. The many events characters keep toes. The brief background situation steaming Sri Lanka ethnic war perfect quick revision us knew introduction didn't. Like I mentioned earlier, motivations implications explained efficiently. You taken aback realism realise overt covert operation really is. It's difficult believe that's things must real life. So real forget John Abraham playing role secret agent, Vikram. This far best performance. In addition, you've walked theater, marvel gutsy decision producing film nature - film devoid masala gets. I sure, film number things aren't authentic dangerous situations agents operate glares you. At time, wonder one agent's life really considered precious enough entire R&AW put men stake. Moreover, later, pace slackens second half Madras Cafe tries delve emotions people aren't connected with. I don't much problem slow-paced films I inconsistency pace. It's like apply sudden brake driving top speed. For example, person kidnapped released within five minutes, methodology decoding hidden messages painstakingly childishly described later film. Also, Madras Cafe tries bring sentiments terrorists little late film, especially considering film clear stands issue. A one-liner takeaway end film amplifies fact enough time spent side. I think brilliant filmmaker/writer picks side sticks it. Then, need show side? On hand, I loved contrast director Shoojit Sircar brings out. Every while, place full violence turmoil see peaceful monk walk monastery. Also, contrast monstrosity terrorists/rebels agains beautiful landscapes Sri Lanka captured beautifully cinematographer Kamaljeet Negi. So, are, things brilliant, others much. A film insists naming names events build assassination ex-Prime minister India 1991 mention releases week Rajiv Gandhi's birthday. Nevertheless, film I'm glad made, even things I didn't quite like. A film I hope watch, even don't rush theaters. A film makes wonder timing, given current political climate country.
