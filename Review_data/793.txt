“A story tells lot writer.” running thought Roy. Almost forcing think film tells lot director. You tell director, Vikramjit Singh struggling tell story, like character Kabir Grewal (Arjun Rampal), director struggling film's narrative. Roy thriller. It romantic film. In fact, two romantic love stories try hard intertwine mingle. Unfortunately, connect doesn't work all. I imagine worked hands better narrator but, barely see parallels even trying hard. The mystique around two stories created trailer, demystified early film. Only intentional. In fact, big reveal feels neither big much reveal comes about. The film lingers. Not good way though. It could accentuate characters. All four lead characters brooders, male female ones. Interestingly enough, film feels verbose. Despite long silences, characters speak, good chance attempt something deep philosophical. This great, especially films say non-inane dialogue. But sadness is, lines meant meaningful introspective turns inconsequential. I always complained Hindi films don't enough conversations, dialogue. It refreshing see characters actually converse Roy. Individually, conversations interesting, don't add making film engaging. The lines boring film stretches “nothing happening”. Again good way. It doesn't help writing “romance” parts weak. You clue Aisha about. You know Kabir character Roy going internal struggle source forlorn attitude. But, neither writers get quite grapple inner voice troubled. What keep going despite disappointment able fathom happening performances. Arjun Rampal finally comes wooden mould lets eyes speak speak volumes. A lot internal conflict sense expression body language rather character's thoughts come dialogue. Jacqueline Fernandez less doll little character. It would've great role little detailed. The intriguing lot, could call Ranbir Kapoor's performance holding one expression. But one scene hopelessness life turns hope see light eye change without movement facial muscle. But none good enough make endure 2.5 hours “so much talk” leading pretty much nothing. It almost filmmakers sense too. What else explain fillers form songs fight sequence seems made able promote film thriller. Even give film point two extra attempting something different, can't escape fact borderline making little sense. Different ain't good enough.
