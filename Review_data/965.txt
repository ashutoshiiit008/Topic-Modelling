I love cinema discussed like Maths question paper coming examination hall. Where participants / viewers compare mental notes. Questions like “What think happened him?”, “Why that?”, “Where come from?” It gives film much needed mind-space exist beyond stipulated running time. The Return film similar genre. By making details central character’s background explicitly clear, director Zvyagintsev heightens mystery thriller enormous proportions, solves partially end film. However, unlike mysteries, one got scam, murder robbery connected it. Somewhere Russia, two young boys - Andrei (Vladimir) Ivan (Ivan) - shocked discover one day father, believed more, suddenly come home. We’re told father (Konstantin) was, while. The mother doesn’t explain, boys get answers man himself. Even two jump idea extended fishing trip father proposes, hope get know better. I haven’t seen film like this, before. The film intense, brooding eerie throughout. You’re left guessing whether father ghost, dictator stranger bent using kids means. Why suddenly propose fishing trip? Where taking them? Does want boys turn men? Why doesn’t tell while? These questions keep crossing mind throughout. Interestingly, questions troubling two boys well making difficult trust man completely. If look deeper, Ivan Andrei represent two faces human mind faced mystery - former questioning rebellious, latter easily accepting things way are. There times place father’s shoes realise can’t blame way is. He’s absconding 12 years. He’s even familiar world two boys - likes, dislikes. Scenes asks Andrei settle bill restaurant, shows get car wheel muddy track, punch guy robbed two money - point towards wanting sons stand feet defend themselves. In way, never fully convince father villain film everytime feel so, tops something makes endearing. It heightens mystery back-story father. The irony screenplay - film’s biggest strength fuels suspense - mood three characters trip. Here are, going fishing trail beautiful countryside. But there’s little speak other. The photography captures mood perfectly, lending beautifully film’s cheerless feel. The director shows particular fascination landscapes, especially water, you’ll know why, see film. The climax breathtaking easily biggest highlight film. The shock, character’s reaction shock follows after, left sweaty palms. The closing sequence (a fond tribute The Motorcyle Diaries), seals films beautifully, left immensely satisfied. I loved Ivan’s performance film. Despite child actor, perfect nemesis father. Shot mostly close-ups, well-written character film, father. Konstantin fits role T tall, lean figure athletic build point character’s history somewhere military Russia. I imagine high must discover film film festival. The film made stuff make smile satisfaction discovery fine, new directorial voice Russia. An outstanding debut, measures.
