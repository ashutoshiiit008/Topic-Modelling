Know feeling you’re bid farewell someone? You’ve got flow sorted head - probably hug, look other’s eyes, maybe even kiss, make promises call, upload pictures.... suddenly someone - maybe common friend - pops scene spoils moment, spoils entire plan head. That’s beginning David Lean’s Brief Encounter. Lovers Laura (Celia Johnson) Dr. Alec (Trevor Howard) bid farewell other, good. And moment spoiled rather chatty intrusive Dolly (Everley Gregg), familiar Laura. It’s tragic Alec able gentle press Laura’s shoulder offer comfort, heart reaches them. You however realise complete nuisance magnitude Dolly’s intrusion end film. By time, you’ve seen Laura retreating shell thoughts, sitting front husband, imagining brief affair Alec narrating imaginary confession sorts, detailing met, went, felt this. An extra-marital affair, borne stable, happy marriage bad thing. But here’s Laura still managed win sympathy - honesty explains predicament, touching. You realise could know social impossibility affair, Laura Alec fallen love pure innocence. What I found even convincing manner fall love - stunts, songs, cups tea, hanging together rather engaging conversation after, Laura finds absorbed eyes. A big question popped head though - it’s trick women cinema fallen (reminded Billy Wilder’s The Apartment especially). When woman know coincidentally going show movie, ever going impolite say, ‘I’m alone, I’ve got balcony seat, I hope we’re sitting together.’? Her politeness contrary gives man takes bait rest history. Something similar happens Brief Encounter. Laughing together looking direction, produce strange signals man woman. I’m big fan using restraint films. In Brief Encounter, I liked way David Lean never made two lovers go top - romance subtle, restrained completely self-aware it’s wrong-doing (a momentary kiss halted shadows people). If film re-made today, would break forms explicitness. An interesting parallel I observed Laura’s family life meeting Alec. The first time goes Alec, returns home find son unwell. It’s gentle sign, worthy enough indicate disapproval scheme things. My favourite metaphor film Noel Coward’s screenplay begins Laura Alec’s relationship - minutes bump other, Laura troubled speck dust eye. The Hindi phrase ‘aankhon mein dhool jhonkhna’ used symbol start illegit affair - nice touch, Mr Coward! At 86 minutes, Brief Encounter lives title. It’s engaging watch, filled great lines, classic romantic moments performance Celia Johnson that’s worthy Oscar nomination received.
