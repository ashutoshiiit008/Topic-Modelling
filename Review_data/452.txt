~ ~ ~ Update ~ ~ ~ I happened catch Iron Man 3 DVD here's update DVD features. You’d think best thing DVD movie that’s fun Iron Man 3 would film itself. Well, think that, you’d forgiven little wrong. An 8-minute bonus featurette titled ‘Deconstructing Scene: Attack Air Force One’ shows making one thrilling set pieces film, believe me, making scene blow away even scene itself. A true victory production VFX, reminds movies magical. How one wishes though, Shane Black made consequential appearance featurette, provide insights director sees scene. The DVD also another interesting bonus feature – minute-and-a-half behind scenes sneak peak Thor: The Dark World, releases November 2013. The clip make look forward it. Then there’s film itself, makes fun DVD watch big screen. As norm days, packed single disc; one sadly subtitles language options regional Indian language. One small touch Iron Man fans might enjoy fact DVD Menu loads intro Jarvis, Iron Man’s AI sidekick (for want another word.) ~ ~ ~ Original Review ~ ~ ~ In epic climactic conversation scene Kill Bill Volume 2, one Quentin Tarantino’s masterstrokes Bill explaining Superman mythology The Bride; says that, unlike superheroes wear costume become ‘super’, Superman exactly is. Superman. Clark Kent disguise; that’s costume. While Tarantino said Superman makes perfect sense, comes said superheroes, I will, once, differ man. We known choices make; superheroes love, Marvel universe DC universe, discovered immense power chose channel heroic manner. And moment made choice, became superhero. So, true Superman, actually true others well. It is, quite simply, fundamental truth lies core every superhero story. Batman always Batman; Bruce Wayne costume. No superhero film, me, explored fundamental facet superhero mythology quite like Iron Man 3 does. There may many Iron Man suits, anyone wear, one Iron Man. The film also carries message biggest bit heroism perhaps defeating demons within. But, heck messages really. Iron Man 3 is, all, smashing good fun. The story Iron Man 3 set post events occurred The Avengers, released exactly time last year. Iron Man, remember, passed portal another dimension back crashing ground freefall. Since then, Tony Stark hasn’t same. This time around, also contend obscure, secretive villain known The Mandarin, responsible series mysterious bomb blasts around globe. The film bit slow build up, gets full throttle, described audio-visual spectacle. Thrilling action set pieces, peppered Tony Stark’s acerbic wit through, along number superb supporting performances make film rollicking ride alright. It still isn’t nearly much fun The Avengers, quite easily best Iron Man film far. Big credit must definitely go Shane Black, directs franchise first time, Jon Favreau directed first two installments. In fact, Shane Black’s first feature since insanely clever Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (also starring Robert Downey Jr) way back 2005, second feature film director. Huge jump terms scale, especially considering eight year gap, Black full justice it. The Iron Man – Tony Stark relationship feels much intense, yet much comfortable, I suspect, due touch brought Black. But then. Robert Downey Jr Tony Stark. Who Iron Man. You can’t say either Tony Stark Iron Man without picturing Robert Downey Jr man face voice character. His electric presence, spontaneity sheer physical character makes Iron Man thrilling cinematic superhero is. Never egotism self-aggrandizing humour looked good screen. Robert Downey Jr one finest mainstream male lead actors world, watching always joy. Shockingly enough, possible someone steal scenes even Robert Downey Jr’s nose. And, that, better Sir Ben Kingsley? Though little screen time, kind character performance actor die for. The Mandarin becomes one enigmatic memorable villains ever perhaps actor could bring table; see, acting twice harder acting once. (That’s trying enigmatic The Mandarin. Wink.) Guy Pearce, also joins franchise first time Aldrich Killian, super-scientist secret, superb well. So franchise regulars Don Cheadle Gwyneth Paltrow Col James Rhodes Pepper Potts, respectively. I watched film IMAX 3D, doubt added experience watching best-executed action scenes you’ll see. Otherwise, I don’t think watching 3D mandatory; I’m sure film good fun 2D well. For phenomenal acting, great action goosebumps you’ll undoubtedly get every single time Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, film must watch. Submit Tony Stark’s world; you’ll good time, I promise. PS – Stay right end final credit roll fun little Easter Egg!
