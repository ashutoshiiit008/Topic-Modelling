There’s nothing like movie jolts groove. A story man everything evil, mends ways there’s much wrong world anyway. Throw religious revelation testosterone-spewing conflict filled journey you’ll “gripping” drama. Fortunately Machine Gun Preacher everything seems like it’s right track – Gerard Butler , post-colonialist debate, character graph title seems like it’s leaked graphic novel. Machine Gun Preacher based real life story Sam Childers (played Gerard Butler film) starts violent, ex-con heavy dependency alcohol drugs. He similarly placed pal Donnie (Michael Shannon) couple pit stops away hell, told. Before swallow, Butler manages turn ways discovers Christianity. The good thing Forster doesn’t expect share beliefs. He decides must relocate Africa missionary work, building (clean) successful construction business. While Butler blue-collaring up, Uganda Sudan call much like prayer. Forgive tone, it's exact feeling one gets watching film. The film barely takes time establish sudden transformation nice guy, let alone really nice guy soul. It slowly then, transcends unbelievable film, story isn’t narrated well. A quick note scenes Uganda Sudan: visual description heart-wrenching. Through course film becomes sort holy warrior Sudanese orphans, saving internal system. There, Machine Gun Preacher gets bunch brownie points, making audience want consider leaving cushioned lives betterment world. Or least feel horrible privileged. Gerard Butler gives stimulating performance, confusing one. He’s tough, alright. You’re afraid he’s violent no-gooder want applaud nerve uproot life – cannot, life you, move beyond reaches situations. I’ve read book movie based (Childers’ memoir Another Man’s War) film adaption easy. It waters every effort film makes create, visually gripping account happens eccentric character enters world blocked out. The biggest flaw though, Machine Gun Preacher fundamentally conveying film takes White American man, power kill name god, “oppressed” see better life. That get analyzing message film. Marc Forster ceases bend towards judgment see Butler’s demeanor. The film leaves lot unsaid, thought might considered unnecessary. My question – couldn’t done without politics? Butler needn’t move psychopath half-saint. He could regular guy genuine help – somehow, film can’t decipher he’s helping assuming high role power massage ego. You could watch film Butler’s performance – don’t attempt answer question marks head.
