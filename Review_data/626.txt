I never cried much I watching I Am Sam. I warned, I still went ahead thinking it’s 2 hour film. I’ll shed tears, else? Tears understatement, I’ll say, 2 hours. So I picked Milk review, I channeled everything I heard film. There’s something else watching film post Oscar hype, able agree, disagree, dismiss confirm conclusions people made film. Or better so, make own. Gus Van Sant’s Milk biopic Harvey Milk, gay rights activist. Sean Penn gives powerful performance, 40 year-old gay man moves San Francisco New York boyfriend Scoot Smith (James Franco). Set 1950s, couple open camera shop neighborhood, realize, Milk finds fighting gay rights. The film captures true essence undercurrent bubbling homosexuality, explores San Francisco became gay capital. Here see strain relationships, Milk moves. After run Board Supervisors, 3 years row, finally gets elected, see shift nervous, closeted man public-speaking, motivational national figure. All this, however, happens cost. He meets eccentric lovers, behave pit stops political career: Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), fellow community organizer, followed Jack Lira (Diego Luna), Mexican-American becomes jealous Milk’s advancing career. This first problem film. It relies formulaic story-telling pre-supposes it’s plot-points conflict personal professional. On one side transformation happening, see individual’s journey beautifully played Penn, interspersed preachy sub-text neurotic relationships, becomes bit monotonous. That come Dan White. One Milk’s crucial relationships, White conservative Catholic man considered homosexuality sin. An alcoholic, White (played Josh Brolin, No Country Old Men fame) becomes Milk’s biggest tragic hurdle. Their complexity, powerful whiplash personalities intensely carved out, almost swirls in. As fictional biopic, DVD phenomenal extras. It almost serves mini-visual autobiography Harvey Milk, small docu called Remembering Harvey, noted political figures time speak him, deleted scenes – brilliant extended version Milk’s first public speech ‘Marching Equality’ – behind-the-scenes look various marches, protests real-life events San Francisco Milk fought for. Definitely DVD worth investing in. Milk isn’t flawless political hero. It’s personal account motivation, hurdles, imperfect yet touching story told. In way possible.
