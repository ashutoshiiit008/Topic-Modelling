Note: This one rare occasions reviewer chosen revise ratings. The rating first viewing (at Mumbai Film Festival) " Catch DVD sure". It bumped "The keen must watch screen; else DVD" second viewing (regular theater cut) reasons stated below. ------ Update: Whether seemed like crisper cut theatrical release, whether correction expectations, already watched film MFF 2012, I'm sure; I liked Pune 52 second viewing. Much like Talaash, set expectations thriller one man's emotional journey best enjoyed expectations mind, Pune 52 marital problems faced lower middle class couple early 90s, makes impact seen drama rather thriller. The performances Girish Kulkarni Sonali Kulkarni seemed even better time. Also, dialogues, penned Girish Kulkarni, outstandingly written. At risk sounding like broken record, I keep saying Girish Kulkarni one best Indian writers well actors today, underlines Pune 52. The larger issues film - sketchily written characters, gaping plot holes screenplay flaws remain. Since film thriller well, I can't talk detail, suffice say many loopholes pointed writing. Still, manner shot, engaging enough drama married couple, dialogues performances Pune 52 film makes one theatrical watch, sure. ------ Easily one disappointing films year far, Pune 52 one films seem promise much various points runtime, fail deliver whole, various reasons. Set Pune one critical times history country - economic liberalization days early 90s - tells story Amar Apte wife Prachi, facing problems stem Amar living - private detective snoops peoples' personal lives. Amar takes work extremely seriously, even though others around seem nothing contempt lack 'success'. Things take turn murky Amar gets involved case brings contact woman named Neha. As mentioned earlier, Pune 52 always promised lot. Intriguing promos exciting names like Girish Umesh Kulkarni associated film meant pressure always cast crew deliver knockout film. And certainly don't, primary reason writing. As character, Amar written shoddily. His 'dreams' becoming detective since child seem forced unconvincing. The 'Eureka' moment narrates, convinced wanted detective makes little sense, flip-flops character makes form shaky character graph irreparable damage graph film itself. As thriller, film's plot twists predictable mile away. Perhaps disappointing part fact one point film seems walking Chinatown path, raising hopes, spiraling away unflinching mediocrity soon after. As drama couple whose marriage rocks, film moments. The fights Amar Prachi written realistically performed brilliantly. Also, one can't deny film manage hold audience far tension regard destiny failing marriage concerned. If film remains watchable large part it, actors. Girish Kulkarni easily one best actors country today, tries best lift poorly written character. He manages succeed sometimes, making root Amar. The fact voice dubbed someone else irks times, used Girish's natural voice. Of course, probably done interest film, since Girish's natural voice would've thin character. Sonali Kulkarni dependable always. She emotes beautifully conveying frustration marriage. Her character essentially naive, convinces naivet√©. Sai Tamhankar mysterious Neha looks better she's ever looked, manages bring air intrigue her. Also, good amount effort put production design create 90s feel. The old rotating dial phones, film posters, license plate numbering time even Gold Spot manage add feel it. Although exactly film set time period mystery. The film shot well certain parts. There number inexplicably over-exposed shots, many seem necessary. Debutante director Nikhil Mahajan handles certain portions well. Also, choice shooting long dialogue scenes single shots really impressed me. They show mature attitude towards cinema. However, larger scheme things inexperience shows. Certain critical portions, particularly thriller backstory bits needed seasoned hand helm. The film also far long good. Hopefully, filmmakers think getting shorter cut ready theatrical release. Pune 52 means unwatchable. But, considering expectations I film, I walked away extremely disappointed. Update: A slight correction review. According director Nikhil Mahajan, Girish Kulkarni dubbed lines film. Also, cut film shown MFF 2012 work-in-progress cut. The theatrical cut film still readied expected different one premiered MFF.
