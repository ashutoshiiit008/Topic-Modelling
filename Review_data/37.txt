Those who’ve watched Zero Dark Thirty Homeland familiar torture technique involves letting captive prisoners sleep playing loud, noisy music shining bright lights times. I’d slightly exaggerating I said could put theatre playing A Good Day Die Hard instead. Nearly quarter century Bruce Willis’ John McClane first scorched big screen unflinching, deadpan badass-ery, aged still cheerful action superstar returns fifth installment series; one ended previous film. Directed John Moore, film set Russia time, John McClane come pursuit estranged son custody authorities there. However, quite soon discovers son isn’t usual vagabond imprisoned Commies – then, I think might feeble attempt story. All hopes evaporate soon after, however, Father-Son McClane duo spend rest screen time bringing Russia rubble themselves, customary scratches bodies. Loosely put, Taken yippee-ki-yay touch, pointless background story seems like domestic quarrel rich powerful Russian men. If sorry excuse plot makes grimace, execution film nothing less assault senses. Humans, vehicles, buildings even public infrastructure treated amount disdain trigger-happy McClanes, don’t second seem think discretion option. After all, waste time thinking, blow something up? Admittedly, high-octane camera work first 20 minutes, I realized octane level didn’t ever intend dip. After that, trying out-think writer director terms ludicrous could get. What good see though Bruce Willis hasn’t gotten penchant fun world crumbling around him, without interference. He adds cutesy comic touch John McClane’s paternal instincts, straddles line father looking son original bad guy hunter. Jai Courtney, plays McClane’s son Jack, hasn’t friction screen presence likeability Willis. He bland emotion well humour, makes father-and-son reconciliation aspect film seem like bit joke. A Good Day To Die Hard tedious watch, film never eases action, fully testing limits suspension disbelief. If anything good film all, may make fans original films go back revisit them, good old-fashioned action fun. The people might find film watchable absolute hard-core exclusive action film fans, Chulbul Pandey bit low-brow.
