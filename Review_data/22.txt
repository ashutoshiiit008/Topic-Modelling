*I vacation. Pradeep kind enough review film wogma. So goes... ~ meetu* ---------------------------------------------- 2 States kind film likely give exactly expect it; isn't necessarily good thing. A young, vibrant love story Punjabi boy Tamilian girl - or, Indians seem revel relegating highly generic region-based nomenclature 'North Indian' 'South Indian' (for record, 'North India' 'South India' places!) - 2 States gives thoroughly engaging lead pair amidst stereotypical humour taking respective states. (The showy Punjabi condescending Tamilian, instance.) That attractive leads going fall love given. Arjun Kapoor Alia Bhatt occupy screen well young, yuppie characters ease. They play well; use cliché abolished even slavery was, share 'great chemistry'. What also nice see easy manner couple - boy well girl - handles intimacy, without made big deal we're used seeing movies. In fact, scenes featuring couple rather refreshing. In context big mainstream cinema, closest we've come capturing spirit youth today treat relationships. But India, love mere beginning. The hard part convincing respective sets parents, particularly happens lie opposite sides great cultural divide brought forth mighty Vindhyas. In terms plot, film stays largely faithful Chetan Bhagat novel adapted from. One safely say 2 States isn't Bhagat's worst bit writing, though isn't particularly saying much. Where film falters, despite largely watchable, precisely actually strongest - conflict prevents couple love ending together. If romance portions breezy make smile often, portions involving parents look like belong another film, one set decades back. True, Punjabi-Tamil (or, North-South, prefer it) clash meant evoke comedy, comes across forced. It's hard digest kind acrimony seen film day age, even though reluctance older generation still much reality. Another sore point film relationship Arjun’s character Krish shares father played suitably gruff Ronit Roy. It keeps cropping film, never fully explained. The film also sinfully long. At two half hours, considering demographic film aimed at, film good thirty minutes long. The climax film drags on, drags more, ending exactly knew going end. The film also follows forced non-linear narrative doesn't seem point. Why moves back forth time mystery, would worked flat-out linear narrative. The real takeaway film, then, manner supporting cast, four parents precise, create characters over-the-top yet believable. Revathy Amrita Singh, particular, top notch. While Arjun earnest Alia brings spunk, verve spontaneity part, aren't faced task creating distinct characters, way senior actors are. It would helped immensely film memorable soundtrack, though couple songs quite catchy, fair. When walk 2 States, then, one isn't likely absolutely gushing it, one particularly annoyed it. It gives promises - tolerable enough fun long lasts.
