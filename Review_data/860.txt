Skip italicized bits read review. The italicized bits thoughts on-going war Mumbai interspersed review. Over 40 hours since country held hostage. Each one us hostage TV channels, internet reports, twitter us hostages inside Taj, The Oberoi Nariman House. Each one either scared worried angry frustrated combination thereof. But one us helpless. What do? Abuse government, opposition, media? Did got bored within 20 minutes. What else I do? The thing I think panic little possible continue routine. So I I every Friday. Trying, albeit unsuccessfully, ignore what's happening 150kms away, trying keep angst world outside making judgment world inside dark, secure(?) cinema hall. Bold themes atypical resolutions fascinating. And time around Onir explores relationships detail - love angle, love triangle, husband-wife, parent-son. Unexpectedly though, brother-brother relationship left half-baked, even untouched. Yet, enough keep engrossed wonder, next? The basic premise, love triangle, takes confusion mature characters. There's beating around bush. The characters behave like normal person situation would. The second premise feels like right Mahabharat side-story made Amar Chitra Katha comic own. Boons curses. And inevitable loophole way-out curse. It comical too, contemporary. At one point I actually thought Shabana Azmi going pull Kunti Maybe I'm seeing war isn't any... Sharman Joshi awesome unsure guy torn-between-two ideologies. Chitrangadha Singh looks ravishing convinces us she's one confused woman. Boman Irani daddy cool, Shabana Azmi mom wanting fit new generation, used comic relief. But fill screen life even taunting angry. The chemistry cute, oldie couple shares makes want like them, older. I want grow old. I don't want die today. I want lessons sarcastic mom-in-law... Of course, witty lines - funny otherwise - help every one set right mood throughout movie. Your heart might reach single character, none want "right thing". But, except Harry's (Sanjay Suri's) exaggerated selfishness, situations real enough us keep judgment bay too. Each character seems right confined space. And lines get blurry, always do, add external factors - people situations. This one movies I'd watch I'm less agitated frame-of-mind. If unusual storyline climax, study characters. Yes, situation improved mind feels relaxed now...gotten used it? Already?? Stay safe!!
