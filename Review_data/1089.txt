I loved Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I don't know last long enough become classic cult (never understood terms). But, I enjoyed every single moment I spent theater. Yes, even though full two-and-a-half-hour-long film. Three friends Spain close deal made years ago - choose adventure three experience together. The characters alive, cast lively, writer thoughtful movie clean, soft, perceptive entertainment. There nothing profound Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara; neither bring insight I don't already relationships. But, connects word go. Maybe, I connected instantly things close home. I've spent lovely week-long, road-trip Spain. I've walked little towns narrow, stone-bricked lanes. I've lived quaint hotels lovely lobbies. And cinematographer brings alive. Spain, beauty are! Add nostalgic mood, piece adventure three friends experiencing. Deep sea diving, latest addition "I love" list. And sky-diving I've wanted (with mom, less!) last 15 years. The third adventure, uh...well...that one I think I'll play woman card leave at, "I'm happy enjoy vicariously Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar Hrithik Roshan." Also fast getting list "I love" three men! And goodness, even Katrina Kaif. Abhay Deol instantly endearing sorted-out, problem-free, likeable guy runs little average emotion man. Farhan Akhtar's Imran aptly described a$$hole. He plays perfect shallow-outside-deep-inside, observant poet doubles comic relief. If I pick weak-link it'd Hrithik Roshan, I'd nit-picking acting falls flat second half. He, all, get annoyed "oblivious arrogance" attitude. Usually, introductions bore me; face. And climaxes, disappoint me. The better build-up towards it, worse fall end. Very films manage climax Goldilock's "just right". Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara's set-up subtle, don't even realize that's till opening credits begin. And climax yep, "just right"! A minute would much. Yeah-yeah-yeah, I mandatory reviewer's disclaimer "There couple flawed moments." But know what, pass quickly, fun/sweet moments many more. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara like zindagi itself, mistakes. It's closure importance closures. Because move on. Only then, new beginnings, deserve. "Life once-only gift. Live fullest." The clich√© alien parents. And becoming mantra responsibility-free generation. And not? New money becoming easier get even easier spend. Savings dated concept. Because knows? You might live long enough enjoy retirement. Reminder: We live world tsunamis bomb blasts. So, merit "live moment" So, planning next vacation? Fine, fine, take time. Meanwhile, book tickets praise I've showered upon film raises expectations high, fall.
