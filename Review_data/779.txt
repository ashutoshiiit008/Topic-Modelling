You dinner friends. One little upset something happened day. He gets irritated something waiter bursts anger him. The waiter done something really petty, something wrong big deal. What do? Join friend? Defend waiter really mistake, means going friend. This minor version dilemmas Right Yaaa Wrong presents. The story moves along interestingly thought-provoking. If only, tighter better performances, would must watch. I completely enjoyed audience, I really didn't know whose side I on. Both seemed right seemed wrong. Both evoked sympathy, I wanted win. And together kept involved, engaged. Sure, I wasn't 100% involved 100% time. First one blame choice slow-pace genre needs chop-chop. The one lousy performances. Each one performing perfunctorily. The dialogue delivery extremely amateurish. Especially bits police officers bonding beginning. True, setting stage bits pieces used later. But functional way relationships put forward make look manipulated contrived together. So much likes Irrfan Khan Konkona Sen Sharma can't cover-up others. These huge minuses. So, story take much burden making film work. And does. I enjoyed back forth enough make trip theater worth beyond review. I enjoy court-room drama much I enjoy intelligent characters out-witting other. They might smartest turn events basic thought put in, conspicuous absence many films day. Yeah, I'm surprised too. I actually liked film titled lamely Right Yaaa Wrong (especially extra aa) starring Sunny Deol. Dancing, fuming, all. But, even decent attention story me.
