On surface, Inkaar story sexual harassment workplace. But layer under, inability ambitious people coming terms feelings, use resources available disposal mask complexes (superior inferior) insecurities. Does really, truly believe harassed? Are devils mind perceiving casual flirtation harassment? Is flirting casually? Does realise trying evoke something deeper within her? Lovely, murky, gray areas. All rendered redundant climax stands awesome loses meaning makes film lose face context film. To story broaches serious abuse rampant current times belittling issue. But, hey hold directors responsible taking social agendas? So, take away responsibility Inkaar makes interesting watch till last half hour last half hour interesting itself. It's fact put together spoils taste. The interest built maintained though departments. I always liked atmosphere Sudhir Mishra creates films. They either set rural parts India show grit urban world (except Khoya Khoya Chand set era long past). Inkaar requires stay chic world cities today I liked sepia tone chose film, giving dark, edgy feel. Though I don't associate brown corporate world. Yet, camera work contributes highly strung atmosphere office advertising agency. However, music, though good, seems place setting. Also, back forth story's linearity feels like cop out. As makers weren't confident pulling played linearly. Fortunately, dialogue good even cheeky times - bringing smiles knowing nods. I especially enjoyed Arjun Rampal's performance. He brings perfect amount nonchalance Rahul Verma's demeanour - kind calm, confident man would carry make believe wrong. Chitrangda Singh nothing special except looks chic right part. I absolutely loved Deepti Naval's act - charming, witty, naughty curious rolled one. It's shame ultimately character seems like cog wheel. Yet, another film makers seem want take concept way. Why make 'sexual harassment'? Why make really wanted - part I cannot give away? Why oh why, lessen weight issue depth emotions?
