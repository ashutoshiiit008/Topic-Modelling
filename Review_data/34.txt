I'm still digesting 7 Khoon Maaf. Bit-by-bit itâ€™s sinking in. Though I cannot say I like better worse, I think it, I certainly understand bit more. I'm sure grasp film improve second even third viewing. But, I don't think I make watch it's tedious watch. The narrative way plain predictable hold interest. This largely made-up enigmatic Susanna, played out, breathtakingly Priyanka Chopra. One main thoughts images film leaves behind is, mystery Susanna is. She scares you, time, doesn't let forget heart went warmth, hour ago. You wanted protect her, still want figure out, desperately look motivations justify whacky behavior - continue liking her. Only greeted development crazier anything you've seen thus far. The problem though know episodes, marriages going end. Of course, 7 Khoon Maaf meant thriller. But, nothing gripping husband dies. And second one, reason marrying dissatisfying. You begin doubt could enjoy would end. shudder Anyway, one culprits could also straightforward, linear narration. Also, way often, build-up falls flat. Now, given Vishal Bharadwaj's command adapting novels films, I'll assume story didn't quite work me. Reading Ruskin Bond's Susanna's Seven Husbands to-do list now, confirmation. It wasn't detailed enough. For example, side characters (Maggie, Khan, Gunga) seem out-of-sync plot quirkiness part story. Not mention performances (Usha Utthup, two male leads (names, anyone?)) extremely distracting too. I understand Susanna husbands eccentric thus quirky side-characters find home midst. But, lack rationale behind three side-kicks' enthusiastic loyalty confusing, disturbing. Fortunately, rest performances perfect. Also, powerful sequences. The manner Musafir's (Irrfan Khan's) idiosyncrasy shot executed, sticks way past two half hours spent watching film. The nervous laughter theater giveaway Hindi film audience comfortable watching sexuality screen. Not filmmakers good sexual scenes either. And filmmakers audience know others' shortcoming. With background, show, also explicitly explain Musafir's need stunning brave. And overcome shock, completely pulled chapter Susanna's life. Knowing fact Vishal Bharadwaj films something going beyond superficial, I tried dig deeper. There's course, riddle Susanna identify deterioration person. But save fleeting references socio-political events climax, nothing looked like larger purpose. Besides serving timeline, events mentioned film might indicate apathy society live in. Which maybe Arun's wife (Konkona Sen Sharma) hardly moved Susanna's acts. To fun story, till gets affected personally. The climax implies sophisticated means breath-stopper. Our Susanna come age got hard comprehend. If haven't figured yet, 7 Khoon Maaf one films I didn't enjoy watching all, still leaves good aftertaste. A film I didn't like watching, I liked. Yep, I'm still figuring out. All I know right now, - heavy, weird dark; breather awesome performances; AND difficult film recommend.
