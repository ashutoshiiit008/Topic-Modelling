Remember Saajan? And dozen films struggle going two male leads love woman? They'd play badminton she'd shuttlecock? I hated supposed large-heartedness one friend 'sacrificing' girl for/to friend, say love with. In Tanu weds Manu lady, Tanu fully-installed brain. Unfortunately, it's malfunctioning maybe heart in-sync still shuttlecock. Only time, it's lady's doing. Yet, doesn't make story interesting. At least, way it's written here. So first 45 minutes film entertaining could ever be!? All's well, doesn't end well, no? The movie starts crisp witty dialogue (and perfect delivery actors) everyone audience laughing loud every alternate dialogue. Alternate dialogue laughter earlier dialogue hadn't died us hear next one. Yep, even though I didn't hear half dialogues first half, I thoroughly entertained. All I still trying best get used Kangna Ranaut Tanu. Though, I don't think I ever settled count. It difficult shake away question - someone else playing loud, boisterous, small-town girl doesn't know male attention gets. While, Kangna passes traditional Indian clothes make-up, I don't think carry long dialogues. Almost every dialogue comes across tongue twister her. While deserves marks trying something comfort zone, lines given wasted doesn't fit bill. On hand Madhavan perfectly wears shoes NRI 'girl-seeing' trip India - unsure, sticking out, embarrassed mollycoddling. But act along spinelessness loses charm soon enough becomes repetitive. The rest characters marginally interesting, fits starts. That's didn't get attention writer; else, potential capture yours. This sad I sitting amongst crowd cheered Ravi Kissen Deepak Dobriyal first scenes. Sure, main characters written detail, plot fails. You barely care Tanu. The character is, don't think deserves wants life. She oblivious ruckus she's causing others' lives. And specimen nature Manu want get Tanu, that's wants; know it's best thing him. These interesting things, protagonists grey characters, somehow looks half-cooked. Also lot happening film superficial. You one Che Guevara worshipper things labeled rebel. While one Guevara poster room propagates value system makes things parents happy. The latter gives inch he's nice people around take ell more. They either meddle manage life misuse kindness. This scratch surface generation's struggle - nice misused OR use nasty. At time, Tanu weds Manu tries show definition love different person. At macro level too, Tanu weds Manu tries say thing two society changing equations. For example, one bride groom's side Indian wedding. And along awesome music go completely tone film. Alas, tone changes makers don't get right. Just writing starts lull, given break interval. But jokes dry up, characters become serious clueless. It's depressing see writer wrote brilliant lines first hour regress total boredom write annoying climax film could ever have. I started thinking Indies reply YRF 'wedding' films I ended writing review.
