You know director grabbed attention well film, refuse believe rustling behind bushes false alarm. Director Kevin McDonald successfully one initial scenes The Eagle on, it’s absorbing film throughout. McDonald already reputation director. He directed Oscar winningThe Last King Scotland besides critically acclaimed State Play. This time he’s tried hand period drama. Based novel, The Eagle The Ninth, film set year 140 AD, tells story Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum), young Roman soldier embarks quest find lost legion’s golden emblem, ‘the eagle’ went missing years ago. The emblem defended father’s army - 5,000 soldiers - believed died conquest, tried conquer British territory, outside Roman empire. Several attempts made retrieve men emblem proudly defended, vain. In fact, Aquila, whoever embarked similar journey never returned alive. The film pure adventure one that’s fraught challenges trust, endurance, hunger survival enemy tribals. Aquila, joined Brit, Esca (Jamie Bell) despite prisoner war, sworn loyalty slave. I loved contrast two characters - Roman Aquila takes help enemy, Brit (Esca) find emblem matters Romans. Esca’s characterisation wonderful shows remarkable colours journey together, often surprising us convincing us humanity always triumphs evil. I’d liked Aquila’s character fleshed little better - makes passionate retrieving legion? What life like father disappeared infamous incident train strong? Some history Esca became slave amongst Romans would also added meat screenplay, especially journey together. Stories search something precious, something lost retrieved, must build enough cause conquest. For example, Eagle emblem important? Why honour empire matter much? The result flat, wooden story two men searching something army determined let it. It’s entertaining alright, journey watchable. What wrecks could turned merely good film, really good film, little effort. The action scenes, slow-mo well-choreographed. Tatum looks lot like Owen Wilson (without broken nose) I felt he’s bit wooden throughout film. If there’s one thing I’d change film, would Tatum - seems like wrong choice lead role. Costume dramas ability transport different world. This film tries to, right first shot, seems something odd. I wondered whether actors dress rehearsal, actors’ dialogues ancient stamp them. Also, road many days, come Aquila Esca don’t grow beard? It’s I call, ‘typos’ film. Despite drawbacks, The Eagle still worth visit. It may register movie you’d remember long time, engaging good way, lasts.
