It's Pakistan incessantly organizing terrorist attacks India. It's Indian daredevil hero, almost superhero. He single-handedly taking enemy out. What's like story? Even it's predictable enough action sequences bad guy gets beaten feel good nation. The hero's victory somehow victory. All expected film. What worked heart pounding second half. Even if, one A Wednesday, especially terms relatively tight plot, Baby strong sequences keep suspense on. In fact, said sequences thought short stories themselves. The episode Nepal one Saudi Arabia were, save scene two, gripping end-to-end. And even know sequence two possible outcomes. It helps villain seems capable anything. He (they) ruthless regard human life, let alone sentiment. These sequences also make film little episodic though. It good thing episodes linked one another, even serially. More like bogies train, lacking character pieces jigsaw puzzle. There points Baby seems go high drama, many times ripe drama avoided, adding edge narrative. It also helps none performances, except maybe whole wife-angle, dramatic. It routine slice life, story covert operations spies things related. Yet, cannot let go fact, Baby film doesn't show anything new. It keeps glued seat, offer something you've never seen before? No. Does keep glued 2.5+ hours film? No. The first half makes shift seat rather bring edge. Yet, far one thrilling films last year so. I don't remember last time I nervous hero (that too, one played Akshay Kumar) even though I knew less film headed. To top off, good hour so. It ain't new, yet keeps glued. That counts quite bit.
