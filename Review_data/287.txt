There least one generation amongst us (un)fortunate enough Farelly brothers' Dumb Dumber part growing - film us remember audacious, politically incorrect hoot. And yes, us actually spent lot time wondering, Jim Carrey's Lloyd Jeff Daniels' Harry, 'dumb' 'dumber'. That generation probably also target audience sequel come 20 years later. Harry Lloyd also 20 years older, seem much dumber, though less adorable. Unfortunately, generation that's around age I first film came also significantly smarter much worldy wise first saw loved Harry Lloyd. That could one key reason Dumb Dumber To make splash earlier film did. Make mistake, sequel audacious politically incorrect first film. It's humour gotten old - I'm talking stuff like cat farts bird feathers. No one spared - old people, young women, animals, Canada - everyone fair game Harry Lloyd. The duo journey find Harry's daughter, given away adoption child. Finding easy all, particularly Harry Lloyd deal with, well, themselves. There one reason watch Dumb Dumber To - two reasons, actually - Carrey Daniels. Both look much older now, admirably, neither seems low energy. They're always there, giving every gag all, even though handful genuinely funny moments film, involve unusually clever writing and/or pop culture references. Breaking Bad fans, instance, surely cheer brief scene shows Harry's new roommate. The writing part though, puerile. There times loose writing leads scenes lot noise made screen, soul audience laughs. As I mentioned earlier, humour obviously dated, doesn't even get points trying. Some humour film also genuinely offensive - much you'd need hugely open mind get offended disgusted. A lot also sexual nature, though laughs derive fact Harry Lloyd usually last figure out. What's still great see, however, Harry Lloyd's friendship. Dubious most, don't really know they're actually friends they're dumb know better, also hallmark earlier film - fact comes it, pair stand go moon help other. It's na√Øve silly, also little sweet. There's solace fact fondness, affection love transcend space time, IQ well. But that's kind characters I'd always find tough mean to. Dumb Dumber To, propelled two fine actors let go completely, loud sporadically funny. It works well sake nostalgia, may also make fun watch large group. Expecting anything akin auditioning lead role film.
