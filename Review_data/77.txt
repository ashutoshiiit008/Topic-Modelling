Sometime earlier week, friend suggested I'd need review All Best copy-paste review Golmaal Returns. I laughed then. On Diwali-eve, I'm tempted use suggestion really well-meaning useful advice. But, non-plagiarizers are, go. (And don't care details, rating says all. Golmaal Returns recommended neither All The Best.) There two buffoons creative types, obviously can't earn - Prem, Prem Chopra (Ajay Devgan) Veer (Fardeen Khan). But expensive tastes style living. So, course beg, borrow, AND steal. And lie, lie cover lie on. And course, successful business tycoon, gullible average nincompoop, Dharam (Sanjay Dutt) completes circle. Yeah, that's kind "plot" looking at. (Of course, choose look it, I didn't.) Add endless stream caricatured characters add commotion. But, razor-thin silver lining dark cloud - good one liners every while. And delivered pretty subtly, especially comparison rest movie. The understated tone lines come make funnier too. But worth spending extra calories you've put festive season. Enjoy extra weight, seriously. Nothing else subtle rest show though. The acting loud background music louder. And that's deemed "not enough" shriek-track played addition background score. Supposedly make us laugh NOT! There isn't anything stylish cool worth-watching actors' appearances either. The women wearing lousiest outfits made way much. The men usual slapsticky mode, cracking toilet jokes, innuendoes occasional witty line. So mundane amount oomph presence could add. Not best lookers industry anyway. A lot older films referred to. Maybe supposed tributes. But looked like insults way used AND film that's paying tribute also needs certain basic quality consider worthy paying tribute, right? There slight comment undying friendship extent best friends go save others' skin. And couple sweet moments Ajay Devgan screen partner Bipasha Basu. The fact worked despite coming towards end tiring film, means contributors shots job really well. If those. Yes, guys, go watch diya burn. Your Diwali happier avoiding one.
