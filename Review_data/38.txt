Have noticed rising background music almost every rom-com plays climax? It’s predictable pattern – rising piano melodies beats, raging one-liner, changes course film, “You hello” (Jerry McGuire) “It magic” (Sleepless Seattle). Following which, music stops, ground breaking 30 seconds revelation. And pair kiss; slow sax playing background. Even though love seeing familiar faces – Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Richard Gere – romance ritual, could write thesis it. A Lot Like Love, too, predictable, kind like relish love-starved day. It’s story two stark opposites (predictability no. 1) Amanda Peet Ashton Kutcher, meet flight still college. Sparks fly, (no 2) one slight variation. Peet looking airplane-washroom-action, Kutcher seems love struck. They find excuses keep touch sparks series meeting 10 years. They grow up, – phase, manage run other. The fun bit film every chance meeting isn’t predictable; lead actors crackling chemistry soundtrack extremely sensual, funny passionate - much sync film. A Lot Like Loveis fresh, doesn’t need rely stereotypes reveal growing bond lead pair. With chance meeting, year year, chemistry/repressed emotions get palpable. Much like rising piano melodies intrinsic climax rom-com, A Lot Like Love’s script (written Colin Patrick Lynch) rises every plot point, predictable climax, want movie move pace absorb every moment growing passion. The DVD, released Bueno Vista Home Entertainment, couple negligible bonus features – audio track director Nigel Cole, deleted scenes blooper reel hilarious courtesy Ashton Kutcher music video Aqualung’s 'Brighter Than Sunshine', possibly best song soundtrack. We like intellectually stimulated, there’s different joy reaching expressive side within you, likes regular dose mush. Unlike typical romantic movies, A Lot Like Love crisp, fresh well-paced love story two lovable characters. It’s A Lot Like Love, love. It’s partly wit, partly humour lots smile-worthy moments!
