People crazy things faith - whether belief lies love, God anything between. And shouldn't surprised Yash Chopra explore theme, picked romance genre. Unfortunately though, times film want change belief film, far far reality. Very few. Sure, might aimed real all. But doesn't sweep feet fairy tale like manner either. In mind, stay last film made man made films characters human, emotions like me, stories absorbed me. Nothing more, fortunately nothing less. Only unfortunately, time around I seen many times screen. And telling story instead playing out. Shah Rukh Khan doesn't let forget Shah Rukh Khan. So much predict expression going reaction whatever happened.

But aren't taken climax. I must say though runtime 3 hours didn't bother me. That huge plus considering I start getting fidgety around minute 120. One thing bothers though that, attempt making story rings true today's time, young hip seem define lot love terms physical attraction. The sexual tension brief moments (before camera angles music go melodramatic us) done well, seem pivotal relationships. This seems little character film. A bit might brought back balance film seem address youth today. It indeed telling us believe. To believe love. To hope come everyone, time comes. Yet, driving force behind recommending film tribute director. Something, I'd watch sake completeness - I tried see films. But, I'd still go back Trishul Deewar Kala Pathar ...
