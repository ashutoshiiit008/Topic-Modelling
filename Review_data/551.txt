A film less two hours yet get bored - tells whether watch film. But, go details, anyway. Bored story won't move. Whatever needs said characters said first 25-30 minutes slow motion. After that, it's wait inevitable happen. Sure, could interest generated transpires, here. There twists leading predictable climax, good twists catch power naps. No, I didn't sleep, it'd easy to. Bored mostly uni-dimensional characters monotonous performances. Jaswant Sisodiya (Manoj Bajpayee) egomaniacal political hoodlum you'd love hate. Manoj Bajpayee invoke disgust towards Jaswant get used revulsion towards soon enough. He also thinks obsession Anju love her. Anju (Tia Bajpai) damsel distress pretty much stays so. There attempt whatsoever show pathos except one mandatory scrubbing-her-rape-off shower scene. Other that, silence voiceover interpret sadness. And knows, maybe go dead face voice you've sexually exploited way been. The third angle triangle character-who-is-not-named Arjan Bajwa enjoys layered character saying much. His demonic anger gets struggle gratitude towards Jaswant aka bhai-sahaband empathy Anju, turn makes him, rediscover human-side. Even though argued characters sound interesting, problem I said two paragraphs them. Add dramatization due OD slow-motion loud background music. What's story women exploited little towns India without showing much one woman it's talking let alone glimpse women? If haven't evoked emotion protagonist, make feel anything issue?
