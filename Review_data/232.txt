You know, sometimes walk movie, carry general dislike one actors wary watch him/her next couple hours. For first time long-long time, I wary entering theatre. Wary actor, so-much director, music director either. It anticipated giddying camera work making anxious. Who going control given suspense-thriller genre? And I disappointed. Amit Roy trick - working really hard thinks cool. The problem look good all. The background score seems like murder-a-minute waiting happen. Now, instead plagiarizing myself, I going read complaints, movie, here. The whole team takes good share blame, ultimately director calls shots directs camerawork. Also, audience feels lot way actors shot. On hand, maybe, maybe performances strong enough rise drawbacks. But, none happens. The entire cast reasonably mediocre job. Each one starts one expression suits character holds rest movie. As I mentioned earlier, difficult judge performances. The extra-dull dialogues didn't help either. The movie called Darling Geeta (Esha Deol) wanted call Aaditya (Fardeen Khan) "Darling" sarcastically every ten mintues. Or may way round. The script far satisfactory too. If script move forward, actors expected change expressions, see. Also, I can't remember another movie songs seemed forced in. Even item numbers beginning end seemed keep people happy. Like promise kept Nisha Kothari. Or like Isha Koppikar's excessively-clad character needed breathing space, "here item number, throw character-defining sari away". Oh crooning, "oooo-oooo-tadap-tadap" sounded familiar, can't remember movie similar tune...it's tip tongue... Yeah-yeah, I good subtle sarcasm. So, suspense thriller makes laugh instead making clench nails seat. A camera moving behalf plot. I left many insults fling whole team.
