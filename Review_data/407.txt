Where one begin film like Himmatwala? You know going range garish extremely over-the-top, Sajid Khan "entertainer". With "the 80s back" announcement, knew leave brain behind. Yet, somehow Himmatwala makes worse ready - righteous brave-heart idealistic mother caricaturish villain supposedly village setting lousy one-liners, isn't one moment hook in. To start off, attempt copy 1983 film, 2013 version brings minor changes 'twist' make proceedings even lame. Then Ravi (Ajay Devgn) cracking poorest poor jokes. Making admit awfulness next line, makes worse (and thought wasn't possible.) Similarly, Paresh Rawal breaking fourth wall asking us come towards go away zooming camera isn't funny begin with. It gets even tiresome repeated over, predictably. When clearly reminded watching film, cannot expected get remotely involved characters situations. So involved Sajid Khan company taking seriously, villain doesn't scare hero doesn't inspire invoke allegiance. All supposedly powerful and/or emotional scenes seem lame aren't engaged story. Interestingly, Ravi's sister (Leena Jumani) gets scene uncharacteristically takes charge life could imply superficial hint woman empowerment. But action ultimately implies submission others life decide her. Even you'd like give Himmatwala benefit doubt social norms 80s apply, realize asked believe realistic. Having said that, Leena Jumani actor sticks quietly plays bit. In contrast gang capable actors competing look idiotic next. You cannot blame Paresh Rawal, Mahesh Manjrekar even Ajay Devgn making laugh. Their timing seems perfect they've asked do. But, they've asked ridiculously funny don't know feel them. I would like think 10-year old old juvenile non-humor. You know stooped new low find relief songs 80s start playing. Relief nostalgia 'nayano mein sapna' ' taaki o taaki' - yep, certainly low! I'd like shift blame sit 'thank God it's Friday' 'bum pe laat' comparison. I questions myself, "Why I even bother films?" "Hope curiosity", besides fact I taken job. I hope something, least one scene, that's worth half-a-watch I don't want keep wondering that'll be. However, feeble reward be, Sajid Khan's Himmatwala curiously shot hypothetical situation he, reason unknown, chooses refer Psycho. Not I liked way done, atypical Sajid Khan. And enough me, even good enough recommend watch even nothing better (unless hope curiosity compelling). Himmatwala truly nothing even people reminiscing 80s would enjoy. If someone really wants nostalgia, they'd go back K Raghavendra Rao's Himmatwala, right? Why need Sajid Khan that?
