Children War I'd like call over-directed film. Beautifully shot fault, dealing one tragic oft-forgotten chapters history subcontinent, Mrityunjay Devvrat's film devastating look Bangladesh's struggle independence, wake West Pakistan's Operation Searchlight - systematic attempt subdue call East Pakistan's independence resorting cold-blooded mass murder. There much appreciate film, doubt that. The story film important, intent cannot questioned all. But, spite fictionalized account, film focused atmosphere recreating sheer extent tragedy, real storytelling; this, despite fact film follows three different stories intermittently. There's story journalist whose life thrown gear violently unexpectedly separated wife; there's pair young siblings orphaned war; finally one smaller thread young Bangladeshi man attempts keep flame revolution alive impassioned speech. The stories characters, however, play second fiddle continuously occurring scenes torture, suffering oppression innocent Bangladeshi's Pakistani army. There long montages bodies, blood death. Each beautifully shot hit gut; there's much happening. Everything film, fact, excess. The background score almost always heavy. The performances, even stalwarts like Victor Banerjee, Pawan Malhotra late Farooque Shaikh saab, far theatrical. Too many pauses, much drama. And yet, story moves along slow pace. At 162 minutes, makes film least 30 minutes longer deserved be. The film hurts you; makes wish humankind sense see human show compassion. Thousands thousands babies born rapes Bangladeshi women tragic months lead surrender Pakistani troops, film makes see large scale human suffering could easily avoided let instinct compassion overrule lust power. Yet, Children War seems like lost opportunity. The film could risen much let characters story speak beautifully grotesque imagery. In fact, one can't help wonder objective glorify gut-wrenching suffering way. You'll know I'm talking about, see really lengthy shot crying toddler amidst blood-soaked corpses, one presumably mother, camera lingers long enough start wondering child made shoot scene would experienced, exchange viewer reinforced point made throughout film anyway. Another personal peeve language film primarily Hindi, even though language characters obviously not. It would seemed much authentic speak Bengali instead. Children War, then, film misses truly memorable, tries visually rub memories tragedy, rather let us identify characters lived it. It brave film, definitely one stands apart we're subjected Fridays, also one deserved much more.
