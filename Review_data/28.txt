Liam Neeson must've busy casting 3 Days To Kill; role seems right alley. That's first sense get settle film get acquainted soon-to-be-ex-CIA Ethan Renner, played Kevin Costner. Because, see, Ethan daughter issues. Yes, paper there's little Charlie's Angels director, McG's latest film haven't seen heard before. And like CIA/espionage/high-stakes-crime based films, one prone many lapses logic. What makes film difficult sit undercurrent humour running it. Combined Kevin Costner's deadpan portrayal character, gives genuine laughs, something really surprised me, considering CIA backdrop film promised. After point realize silliness rather point film flaw it. Ethan Renner, quitting CIA, enrolled one last job, carrot dangled him; one can't say to. In midst it, attempts patch things estranged teenage daughter Zooey. All this, reason, set Paris - least lends film certain amount texture terms place, even superficial level. Ethan's relationship daughter devoted nearly much time action portions film, humour film derived end intersecting times. Interestingly, two threads film also shot cut quite differently. The portions daughter warmer, slower feel them, CIA bits cold colour tone, rapid cuts (which often random distract action.) In middle it, mysterious CIA operative Vivi, actually recruited Ethan one last job. She inexplicable air mystery her, terms wears spends time, none ever explained properly. The biggest letdown film, get used silly is, fact lot mystery built up, fizzles away lame, predictable ending. There many unanswered questions you're bored ask anyway. The film is, fact, predictable part, save one sudden pre-climax twist never expected initially - seems obvious retrospect. Again, left humour film make tolerable, does. Costner Hailee Steinfeld, plays daughter, easy chemistry them. There real depth father-daughter relationship, still makes smile. Amber Heard Vivi looks stunning, think point all. The film also sorely hurt lack clear powerful antagonist Ethan Renner's character. You experience film, then, knowing point all. In fact, I couldn't shake feeling I watching silly Hindi rip-off mediocre Liam Neeson thriller. That, really, sums 2 hours 3 Days To Kill.
