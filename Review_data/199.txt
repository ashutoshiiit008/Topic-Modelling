Cheeni Kum comes across perfect recipe weekend. Great performances, great dialogues, hilarious situations, well-defined characters, great visuals…the ingredients there. R Balki (Balkrishnan), debutant director, done commendable job, since Farhan Akhtar’s Dil Chahta Hai first directorial venture come impressively. Like Farhan DCH, Balki done story come well-etched characters. The characterization done well even cameos like chef’s crew medical store-owner impress. The performances Amitabh Tabu highest quality, though Tabu impresses little Big B, screen persona times reminds Shabana Azmi. Both lead actors impress comical timing (non-slapstick) Urdu diction always spot-on - I wish irritating journalists ‘Aaj Tak’ could speak Urdu like this. The movie also marks return music maestro Illaiyaraja, done tidy job. The mellifluous "Jane na" number Shreya Ghoshal lilting effect. Singer Vijay Prakash done Amitabh's playback wonderfully well - thank god Sudesh Bhonsle change! Editing Chandan Arora slick glitch-free. PC Sreeram’s Cinematography impressive, captured locales London Delhi beautifully. The dialogues Cheeni Kum clearly take cake, sarcastic repartee every flavour movie. Remember Ayesha kapoor? The girl bagged awards role Black. Well, movie, might one Balki’s inspirations writing movie (more notepad section). The movie primarily comedy, neither devoid story, palliative neurons. And what’s more, message too, young heart would surely love. Vis-à-vis movies ilk, Cheeni Kum comfortably scores Jogger’s Park (though JP richer & varied music) Nishabd. Amitabh’s role cleanly developed thankfully traces gaucherie Sexy Sam. All all, Cheeni Kum movie certainly watched. The movie one two small sequences (though comical), may warrant parental discretion, decide would like take kids along. Happy viewing!
