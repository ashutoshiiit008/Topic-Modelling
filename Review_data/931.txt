~ ~ ~ Update ~ ~ ~ I happened catch The Great Gatsby DVD here's update DVD features. It always feels nice DVD packed extra touch there, ensure feels like collectible. Packed outer thin jacket design DVD cover within, DVD The Great Gatsby also interesting special feature. There’s nothing quite like listening director talk passionately film. The bonus material DVD The Great Gatsby 13-minute featurette director Baz Luhrmann talk choices omissions regarding scenes deleted final film. What make desperately want revisit film well book – that’s usually sign true love understanding director craft. The film itself, I thought, makes better DVD watch you’ve already watched big screen slightly disappointed it. The 3D gone, Luhrmann-esque grandiosity assumes smaller dimensions smaller screen, focus wee bit core film – Jay Gatsby love true love life. Now studios DVD manufacturers would specifically start designing DVDs keeping Indian market mind, vis-à-vis languages, subtitles even packaging. Surely, we’re large enough market deserve it! ~ ~ ~ Original Review ~ ~ ~ Grandiose, colourful, orgy vivid imagery music, Baz Luhrmann’s big screen adaptation The Great Gatsby often wondrous look at, lacks – gut-wrenching soul. That isn’t say film unwatchable; even cinematic work independent novel based on, film shows far much promise failing much often does. The narrative voice-over must one big dilemmas cinema. Fundamentally uncinematic nature – going dictate something, visuals – fact remains enduring classics years used voice-overs, they’ve used well. A quick skim F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel ‘The Great Gatsby’, Baz Luhrmann’s latest film based, tell considering style book, film would heavily rely voice-over tell tale. A part secretly hoping Luhrmann would able side-step bring I consider absolute epic – even though I read book first time day I watched film – life. Unfortunately, exactly expected; fact, opening lines film (voice-over, course) taken book verbatim. By means use voice-over biggest problem film though. The film narrated Nick Carraway, World War I veteran back New York, recounts experiences one Mr. Gatsby, enigmatic man everyone seems know of, one really knows. A film is, heart, story enduring love sheer power love holds within itself, competent ensemble cast keeps things least marginally interesting film. However, film’s big failure doesn’t touch you, considering emotional heft story has. Luhrmann displays remarkable command medium, playing visually well aurally, succeeding developing fairly interesting narrative method. He also recreates period film set in, environment feel novel well. The film also terrific soundtrack, one focuses mood emotions sort faithfulness era set. However, 3D film isn’t visually poor usually case, I fail see point shooting film 3D. If anything, film hampered 3D films, glasses almost act like barrier audience characters. At heart epic-like exterior lies core pure love, one deserved laid audience without additional encumbrances distractions. The 3D poor technical choice (quite understandable though, considering Luhrmann’s background theatre larger-than-life manner usually treats films.) As I said earlier, one thing kept continuously interested film performances; Tobey Maguire narrator Nick Carraway functional – seems getting distinctly repetitive expressions, delivery posture lately – supporting cast comprising Joel Edgerton Carrey Mulligan, play husband-wife pair Tom Daisy Mulligan, terrific, Jason Clarke tiny little role. Edgerton, particular, fine actor seems like terrible waste doesn’t films written specifically him. Amitabh Bachchan’s appearance expectedly brief, watching big screen another favourite actors – I come bit – joy. Not surprisingly, strange accent well, delivery baritone, doesn’t really jar. Leonardo DiCaprio simply aces enigmatic Jay Gatsby. Not nearly good performances (his recent turn Calvin Candie Django Unchained, example), still pulls ease conviction almost single-handedly manages infuse lost emotion film - nearly enough achieve story novel deserved, performance works nonetheless. Also, special mention must go Callan McAuliffe plays teenaged Jay Gatsby. Though role brief, uncannily convincing young Leo. I expect people underwhelmed film, probably find downright boring. However, I expect who’ve read novel intrigued film various points runtime. There portions Luhrmann displays snatches brilliance text-to-screen adaptation material, largely seems missed trick two comes capturing soul text. And yes, conscience won’t permit end without strongly recommending F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel anyone love written word!
