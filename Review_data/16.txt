If you've watched Hunger Shame, first impression Steve McQueen's third feature, 12 Years Slave, could possibly it's loud film, standards; loud every sense. Which strange, many ways, film also like Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained influence sedative. Quite clearly, everyone can't pull loud. Steve McQueen's usual tropes remain - intense human drama, long takes, abrupt cuts transport something completely different previous scene shot; yet, 12 Years Slave bit mixed bag. Despite fact McQueen handled considerably larger budget star cast relative ease, still seems like much departure him. The film, tells us story Solomon Northup, 'free man' mid-19th century - indeed, talented man musician - duped forced slave. It follows episodic structure - slightly non-linear, flashes back forth time often - sent one owner next. Despite fact film hook you, affects sheer brutality slaves endure dark days American world history, biggest problem film doesn't move enough. You expect McQueen emotionally intellectually stimulate you, doesn't happen. The character Solomon Northup, soul film, comes across uni-dimensional. For man spent bulk life free, certain placidity way goes things, choosing display spine unnecessary situations, meekly accepting slavery, fact protest vehement. The relationships forms people around don't strike chord. You don't see sympathize character all. And once, Hans Zimmer disappointed music score. Apart fact it, like rest film, loud good, also sounds far similar Zimmer churning Chris Nolan lately. There's much invest emotionally atrocities committed human being, background score reminds Inception. After point, then, I looking forward seeing favourite stars making cameo appearances one other. Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Fassbender (whose look quite superb film), Brad Pitt keep things interesting. Chiwetel Ejiofor, plays Solomon, clearly committed part. He rises writing often, let character anything else. 12 Years Slave talks important subject, serves grim reminder horrific cruelties human beings inflicted upon other. It also creates nice sense period. But it's shortcomings lie narration story. You're simply left wondering saw far worse far longer, compared 12 years doesn't seem long all.
