Just many times going see aging Nicolas Cage try pull supposed accept righteously-motivated crimes, I know. But looks it, doesn't plan stopping anytime soon. Stolen precisely kind Hollywood film I dislike, except film doesn't even really qualify guilty fun, reasons one reasonably count. Will Montgomery (Cage) master thief; team middle heist worth $10 million things go awry Montgomery one caught. Put away long haul, gets parole eight years. But prison term changed him. He wants put 'wrong' life behind him. Life, however, plans him. Director Simon West, whose filmography includes Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider The Expendable 2 amongst others, isn't stranger kind film - ones depend fast pace star value pull film through, opposed genuine plot. He even found moderate amount success them. However, Stolen gives sense déjà vu throughout, really becomes hard take seriously. So much I half expecting Cage start spewing dialogue National Treasure Gone 60 Seconds. Nearly everything movie - story, look, dialogue, background score - generic, been-there-seen-that feel it. The lines often clumsy silly, plot twists much surprise yesterday's news performances, including one Josh Lucas, plays main antagonist, downright laughable. The screenplay, I call that, one convenience. There far many outlandish plot holes even shred credibility. To fair, Nicolas Cage try best rise mediocre script soulless direction. He kind role sleep now, doesn't seem stop giving all. Besides, let's face - kind guy cannot help rooting for. But lack attention detail seen even manner character physically treated - leaves jail, haggard, hint grey stubble generally looks worn out. The rest film occurs within 12-hour period that, yet stubble seems grow inwards rather out. Little things perhaps, matter lot trying create world audience. If one thing works favour film, run time. Thankfully clocking little hour half, film runs fast gets without frustrating audience much. But honestly movie-loving, optimistic side speaking. When audience always step ahead filmmaker, film doomed. Stolen suffers exactly that, making nothing forgettable.
