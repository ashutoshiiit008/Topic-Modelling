I rather wary watching fifth rom-com/romance four weeks. Images Ali Zafar Mere Brother Ki Dulhan didn't help. So, imagine surprise I started drawn characters involved stories within first ten minutes so. The cute lines, casual build-up performances keep engaged smiling throughout. When Ali Zafar doesn't sigh-in-mouth dialogue delivery, quite charmer. You'd fall love Nikhil, character plays, way looks Lalitha. You don't need anything else convince much love her, even she's questioning it. His disappointment reaches whenever you, him, think can't her. For now, Aditi Rao Hydari, didn't need anything take eyes hers. Her eyes emote genuine warmth, generally persona captivating. That besides carried regular girl-next-door, disheveled-hair look sizzling Parisian style equal ease. And nothing London Paris New York. Just Nikhil Lalitha. The usual cinematography cities ceased impress extent I might awe Eiffel Tower/Statue Liberty London bridge I see next time. Nikhil Lalitha though, shown way Ali Zafar Aditi Rao Hydari delightful. Their chemistry riveting goes beyond every time come within foot's distance other. Even otherwise, fun watching hold mirror other's shortcomings. Made human relatable. It's bummer then, chose regular route end film - long-winded, unimaginative, disappointing thus unforgivable. When film broke half-time, I could hear surprised sounds audience, many us didn't realize 45-50 minutes film passed by. Even post-interval well-composed sequences made worry little time film wrap up. That ALWAYS sign film made well. Thus far. No matter many films I see suffer first-half-second-half syndrome, often seeing good first half, I find forgetting interval could still go downhill. The last ten minutes London Paris New York rudely reminded common pitfall. But thankfully, film short enough good parts impactful enough overcome part disastrous last ten minutes.
