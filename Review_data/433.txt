This one movies start lot promise slowly degenerate next couple hours. Arjun Rampal’s character established really well first half hour. Your smile remain intact thirty minutes tongue-in-cheek humor. Then nothing happens next hour so. An average movie-goer would know now, story likely culminate. Thus one surprised climax last couple reels. What surprised though taken cinematic liberties actually tried get away dressing lead lady (Vipasha Agarwal) dress throughout movie. Amazing! All characters half-baked including main character. What motivations whatever explained. But Arjun Vipasha look great. Arjun performed well patches. I wish actual TV hosts would speak normally did. He brilliant scenes just-about-okay some. His performance could, maybe, better didn’t extra stress producer too. Just like Indian cricket captain can’t bat consistently due additional pressure. Though Vipasha’s scenes needed smile knowingly, show promise. Chunkey Pandey given controlled performance. Bomani Irani Sonali Kulkarni wasted loud roles. Why typical loud roles irrestible directors? I truly hope special appearances Shah Rukh Khan Hrithik Roshan rope fans theatres. The problem romantic scenes don’t make feel characters. The touchy ones don’t pull heart strings. There really good funny dialogues aren’t enough last movie. There half-decent songs poetry. Everything looks like fully thought through.
