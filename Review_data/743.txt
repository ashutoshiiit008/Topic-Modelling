God resides within us, need check. OR God dead, doesn't really matter behave. OR God exists happy/unhappy based do/don't do. OR God exists won't help us unless help ourselves. OR Whatever!!? Who cares? Each value systems represented one characters Raaz. Makes interesting debate? Yes, loses direction too, since it'd take real skill articulate things taking many points view. Sure, definite side movie ultimately takes, beliefs portrayed scary. Not appropriately used background music sound design, jump-in-your-seat horrific visuals. But, inhuman. I doubt makers subscribe way life. But, I guess believe idea inhumanity sells. And know irony is? One characters shown bad light "sells" stories based campaign superstition. Anyway, getting theo-talk, many types characters ultimately leads mega-confusion also leaves one pretty uni-dimensional. More pre-interval characters situations take time develop. And suddenly post-interval host new characters introduced obviously one vying attention. The plot develops second half along sub-plots interesting resolution far satisfactory. Usually unexplained issues increase intrigue I like keep thinking even I've left hall. But Raaz's climax feels like, "so much hoo-hah this?" When provide line join dots leave one blatantly, comes loophole 'point ponder about'. Mohit Suri, like always got curious intense opening sequence. But instantly infuriated piece I read couple days ago. How could ask censor certificate 'A'?! I'd hate see child watching visuals movie. Not get excited peoples, X-rated visuals - kind make squirm wait scene get over. However, there's Kangna Ranaut. So, there's enough skin-show too. She well screaming scenes. What's interesting I don't feel character, make pray I'm never position. I didn't identify character. But made go, "hell, I don't want see things she's seeing!" The director-actor duo seem done well together, we've seen similar stuff earlier. She look ravishing ramp - we've seen earlier. Adhyayan needs start basics - let's work dialogue delivery start with, get interested audience. And till DO NOT dance, please. Emraan Hashmi always makes sincere effort. Since, requirement expressions bewilderment care, can't much. But, least bagged two. An opening title card preaches Sant Kabir's doha asking us look within pointing fingers. The protagonist learns hard way. But connection goes flimsy. Not mention, movie tries convey opposite I believe in. Yet, I also believe respect opposite view. So, I didn't agree stand taken, I didn't mind watching getting wee bit terrified along too.
