Disclaimer: This review assumes watched part I. It might contain comments refer event previous film. * A movie uses strong, scheming woman, little rest film, bookends - almost given honor holding story together. A movie uses humor provided local brass band singer leitmotif mark significant events – morose celebratory. Gangs Wasseypur II movie engages quirkiness quirkiness still bearings real. A fusion sorts grit village Jharkhand pulp-film style whackiness. Gangs Wasseypur II much seemingly insignificant characters revenge-driven protagonists looming theme futility violence. The smaller characters add flavor ambiance brutal environment trying thrive in. The main players Wasseypur, Faisal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia) keep wondering next move. We know motivations, yet unsure strike. It macho core. The women undying fire belly. Though don't take matters hands, surely don't stress sending sons war. The ruthlessness violence something else. Some scenes gruesome compensating didn't feature violence. Yet, none seems misplaced overdone. A character gone gone through, motivations bound react ferocity. Only that, almost characters share love hardcore violence, viewer reservations blood gore might well outside theater. For others, though release latent anger, vicarious may be. So much that, every time someone Ramadhir Singh's gang killed, sense success audience. The bigger player taken down, stronger sense victory. Which amusing too. Because good guys aren't really good either, right? They murderers, black marketeers, brutal ones too. A doped-out good-for-nothing son goon, turns goon. So? What audience rooting for? This question bothered quite bit I knew I rooting barbarous slayers. And slight difference emerged - motivations. The loyalty Khans main purpose versus political convoluted reasons Singh's men. In fact, Faisal even caught introspecting got dragged all. He reflects personal dreams. And Bollywood references fit in. As amusing might seem, point unachieved dreams masses. Moments situations like grounded feeling whole film carries make ignore two main grouses I Gangs Wasseypur II. The choice narration – reads like book, chapter-wise, without smooth flow. If weren't Piyush Mishra's voice tone, voice-over would seem never-ending. It felt like story constant exposition, especially voice-over continues second half. That new characters themes still introduced post-interval didn't help either. The complaint goes complaint part 1 – stand alone film. I would much rather seen two parts one enjoyed one story. By watching two parts, films feel incomplete. But, I guess commercial needs take precedence preferences. :) Otherwise film leaves room complaint. Once name one actor done exemplary work would unfair. The women Anurag Kashyap films always stand-out. Not character accorded strength also unique sensuality bring out. Similarly, say Anurag Kashyap film awesome lighting, camerawork, sound, background score would making redundant statement. Also, something way Anurag Kashyap uses music keeps involved. Many time, makes little sense (at least first watch) I still enjoy it. And I love – making enjoy something I don't understand. Does glorify violence? Maybe. It uses brilliantly sure, especially bring narrative crescendo climax. Maybe, exhibits vanity violence using paradoxically. If gang-war film needs made, way it. Else course, watch Godfather, Pulp fiction, read Mahabharata. But hey, try three-in-one. Oh actually, make three-in-two. But like anything combination, won't compare favorably one itself. But whole sum parts.
