Based loosely real-life story group MIT students ended taking Vegas casinos game, 21 offers entertaining alternative usual muliplex fare. Jim Sturgess stars Ben Campbell, MIT grad student aspiring Harvard entrant, finds swept secretive MIT Blackjack team. Sturgess puts nicely layered performance, appearing equally believable character moves geeky college boy Vegas high-roller. Kate Boswoth chips likeable fellow team member Jill Taylor. Sadly, despite decent performance, Bosworth finds character mainly utilized love interest rather strong female lead. Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira Jacob Pitts (as Choi, Kianna Fisher respectively) make remaining team members, ably led Kevin Spacey college professor (and team mastermind) Mickey Rosa. Of course, nemesis required, Laurence Fishburne well suited role casino security chief Cole Williams. Despite much material work with, ever-reliable Fishburne gets job done brings depth character. Although inspired real-life adventures MIT Blackjack team, 21 still much dramatized account. In fact, controversy surrounding Hollywoodization story; particularly ethnic makeup cast. In real life, MIT team members predominantly Asian-American descent. But movie account, key players caucasian. Controversies aside, director Robert Luketic ensures story rolls along smoothly skillful job explaining statistical principles behind card counting without boring audience. Of course, whenever card games depicted cinema, there’s always explanation required, even game simple blackjack. In 21, exposition less clunky say, Casino Royale, it’s still there. Still, trade-off clarity economy, Luketic makes right choices. Despite this, several scenes rather feel like shoehorned perk drama. I sympathy filmmakers – sustain audience interest two hours story college kids playing cards? – it’s hard spot melodramatic scenes injected add spice story. On balance, movie well-paced still keeps surprises store along way. It also poses interesting questions - money change us? What really counts ‘winning’ ‘losing’? As welcome departure usual roster summer blockbusters, 21 well worth watch.
