A people complain I take "without giving movie away" seriously I least give bit story outline. Here go - infidel husband trying hide illicit affair wife who's keen finding woman nagging boyfriend leave wife hired admirer spy husband hired man pretend girlfriend's boyfriend trying escape girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. And I'm making up! I truly don't even know pulled hair begin with, slapsticks like these. They take frustration "brains out" school film-making astounding new levels. How come? Because take actors like Ranvir Shorey throw chute. Ok, can't complain Govinda Riteish Deshmukh set groove. Though know we, much better comedy given chance to. But, charming Sushmita Sen - without extra weight? She act, certainly better this. Same goes Lara Dutta. I've always liked carrying kinds attires style. But skin display yuckety yuck!! And shriek, shriek louder more. And weren't enough there's sequence film Govinda Riteish Deshmukh adopt female voice. And definition women shriek, right? Right! So one point 3 female shrieks once. Oh, nightmare! Actually, I think dubbing heavily processed latest equipment available editing. I refuse believe human could create much noise consistently long time. And much half punch line never-ending circus. Not single gag could bring much smirk you. I sound petty trying find faults film might actually felt offended liked something it. Zilch content unless loud tight slaps, louder background music, moronic situations make non-negative contribution content. The religiously inclined, please let movie-watching audience know ritual need conduct send Dhavan-Govinda combination retirement. Please, please, please, oh mighty ones, please tell usâ€¦
