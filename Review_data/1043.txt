On released alongside week’s Bollywood valentine flick, Ek Main aur Ekk Tu, friend mine rather snide wisecrack make Spielberg’s War Horse. “So essentially, War Horse romantic film horse?” said. In head, I decided I would make presumptions; many rights make brilliant film (the nominations, Spielberg’s sensibilities non-human sensitive war films – ET, Schindler’s List, Saving Private Ryan). Barring John Williams’s avalanche background score, Janusz Kaminski’s beautifully visualized picture film, War Horse actuality long-drawn, schematic film boy relationship horse tries compel fall love it. Based novel name British author Michael Morpugo, film also set backdrop World War. Albert (notable debut Jeremy Irvine) gets attached purebred Joey. As war seeps English countryside, family sell Joey. The narrative moves Joey’s point view, somewhere around 1918. He meets Emile, French farm girl lives grandfather horse-owner too. The difference two owners depicted beautifully Joey’s point view – Albert passionate rustic, Emile gentle subtle. Celiene Buckens Emile delight, often bringing lighter moments, compares two horses two boyfriends never had. But rest changing narrative taken back Albert’s journey – set mission find Joey. War Horse many points becomes epic, forcing feel sense splendor one must felt films like Schindler’s List. This film however, nowhere close – story rather old-world laborious, production design, sets several moments performances lead actors. To fair, give Spielberg allowing audiences sensitize non-human protagonists film (see ET, War Horse). The cinematography Spielberg’s right arm, Janusz Kaminski meticulous clear winner film. He manages bring right play light colours make film pretty picture. You feel Joey, move alongside film, sheer pacing, War Horse fails grip you. You don’t feel lump throat World War films bring it. The war sequences swift grand, reminding films like Kubrick’s Paths Glory hues treatment also remind civil war Gone Wind. The visuals magnanimous, somewhere journey get “wow” audience War Horse, Spielberg lost intrinsic part film – connection. War Horse remains luxuriously larger-than-life film potentially heart-tugging premise, looks pastoral splendid becomes long doesn’t stay you.
