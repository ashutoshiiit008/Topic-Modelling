Within first minutes Gandhi To Hitler, know expectations might decent film going mercilessly squashed. Sure, sit almost two hours could attempt appreciate film might trying do. It tries bring war film worth salt would want demostrate - futility war. And tries say even worst human beings, all, human. But arriving deductions requires lot effort patience. While trying talk I didn't like Gandhi To Hitler, I'm going try ignore laughable use language. I take HUGE leap faith, I hear Hitler speak mix Hindi Urdu supposedly German accent. And I don't know worse better Raghuvir Yadav quote Shakespeare awful diction. Each one actors, except maybe Neha Dhupia made want cry despair. Yet, let's say let go. And become easier let go, distorted narrative, hotchpotch editing, convoluted connections story. Gandhi To Hitler set 1939 1945. I guess tries display devastation Hitler's reign. But I supposed appreciate went betrayed senior officials shown nothing loyalty trust. What I care breakdown, I know nothing heyday? And distractions seems like main story extremely annoying. The shift focus Hitler Balbir (a soldier Subhash Chandra Bose's army) angst ones love go doesn't serve purpose. But draw parallel, men believed violence didn't really redeeming quality would make lovable. They seemed largely inconsiderate towards women. And war film, characters preaching love family values. The umpteen voiceovers, text superimposes, stock footage, grainy sepia texture made Gandhi To Hitler look feel like documentary. How I wish, well-made, adequately-researched, thoroughly-thought-out documentary. Gandhi's track almost 100% voiceover. Hitler's track many people layer thick, visibly bad, make-up. Not mention costumes period drama likely didn't belong period. I'm expert, crisp, cotton, chickenkari dresses (for children) looked out-of-place Germany 1940s. And Balbir's track - I don't feel empathy Indian soldiers shot at, awful situation fault theirs, film achieved? Are sure main reason track elongate run-time make room lip-sync song-and-dance routines? And pushing forward seek attention fourth track - background score. It agenda own. I couldn't figure though. That exactly Gandhi To Hitler felt like. A deliberate even desperate trial joining dots whatever little know last months Hitler's life. A forced attempt making connection Gandhi Hitler. An aimless account endeavor "different". I feel sad writer director. They thought set project would bring lot meaning people indulge them. But, indulger came feeling pity them.
