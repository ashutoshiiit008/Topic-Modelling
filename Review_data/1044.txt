The mystery whether happens isn't intriguing enough. Then hooks audience in, all? Characters? Atmosphere? You need extra spark keep film, unfortunately wanting Warning. What Warning though urge something rarely, ever, tried Hindi films - use vast expanses water create chilling atmosphere. It succeeds times, much others effort something new lost audience. A large part didn't work attributed loss brightness due 3D. I won't say 3D bad, shake bit shark comes way, water bluer maybe film wouldn't come across dull. True, situation sets in, hardly arc story. You regular drill blame-game, self-blame, introspection people bonding and/or fighting on. There huge group dynamics explored situations like this. But, neither thrill element human angle touched upon superficially. It helps actors decent job put together. Except French speaking woman looks out-of-place, maybe intentionally, rest cast goes alternating supportive, scared, strong, sad pretty well. Another thing worked well claustrophobia created open space ocean is. By end film, could feel skin shrivel water 1.5 hours. I don't know I happy attempt made unhappy wasn't taken level deeper engage and/or explore.
