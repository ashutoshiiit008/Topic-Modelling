Tangled story long haired princess Rapunzel. “Oh, know story Rapunzel, whats new there?” - may ask. Aherm, absolutely great visuals starters. This first CGI fairytale Disney totally worth wait. For once, they’ve made intelligent use 3D technology scenes forced. The story predictable, isn’t case Disney animated movies general? No one goes watch Disney animation movies brilliant plot. We go laugh & cry sing & dance characters know going fall love with. Tangled great finesse. It imaginative lovely characters, especially horse chameleon. Irrelevant needless information alert: My love movies descends largely dad, elder brother. But Dad loves action, brother sucker science fiction I particular liking murder mysteries. Animated movies something liked immensely always made good watch together. The point animated films quality bring family together. To it, something everyone. To give everyone happy time. I love musicals. Though, Tangled classic musical, certainly elements. Alan Menken done superb job music Glen Slater’s lyrics great too. Some songs bore striking resemblance Mulan, probably would movies share director Byron Howard (co-director case Tangled Nathan Greno mentioned director too). Let records reflect I’m officially fan guy. ‘When life begin’ felt lot like Mulan’s ‘Reflection’ ‘I’ve got dream’ ‘A girl worth fighting for’ like ring it. I’ve listened lot Mulan’s OST looking forward listen Tangled’s too. Usually, voice-over artists singers too, huge turn off. Thankfully, Tangled voice-over artist could sing masterfully - Mandy Moore. She’s done fabulous job Rapunzel. But I expect excellence singing Mandy Moore. Who surprised Zachary Levi. Donna Murphy class evil Mother Gothel. The supporting cast superb small yet thoroughly entertaining roles. I guess, I’ve convinced enough, grab friends take family along enjoy movie. If kids crime punishable law state Neverland, take kids movie. Watch theatres sure.
