Attention story, acting, dialogue - serve purpose world slapstick comedy. The beauty director minimal role play. It takes one-word instruction loud actors - "louder!!". And louder compete loudest. Hire amateur cameraman wants try lenses angles book. Since work taken care efficiently, director write dialogues himself. After all, every 100 inane lines written sure a-line-and-a-half make average person laugh. That much comedy caliber aims at! By way, slight connection title movie characters feel money. Koena Mitra, Celina Jaitley Riya Sen like toy rattles; amuse target audience, noise create intolerable rest. The show skin unbeatably gratuitous. What wonderful waste talents like Riteish Deshmukh, Shreyas Talpade, Anupam Kher! Though Riteish’s comic timing great, whole act looks like repeat performance dozen odd comic roles done. His make-up girl done really well. Shreyas Talpade done best could character lines. Anupam Kher unnecessarily yet another unnecessarily tasteless character. Suniel Shetty justice role especially superb timing couple scenes. Too little, late. All half-decent performances put together cannot save movie random story shoddy screenplay. Sexual innuendos galore amuse teenagers. There typical slapstick fare - loads make-up wigs, people slapping circles, funny lines losing charm repetitiveness, people playing catch diamonds fly air. Add dash melodrama - "“xxxxx needs yyy lakhs Rupees operation, going die z hours". The perfect recipe nagging headache. The picturisation songs (except title song) would done better album made M TV. Feet tap music title song ‘Dil mein bajaa guitar’ half-hummable. What nags – worth reader’s time even read review?
