Paul Giamatti’s face features usually land comic roles. This coming age film, transitions comic actor someone deliver much more, extreme maturity. Although title may suggest be, Barney’s Version romantic parts, memoir witty comedy lasts. It’s breezy, nostalgic ride life Jew, Barney Pagnofsky, television producer amateur dramas, reflects life’s highs lows, love gained lost, time, grappling Alzheimer’s. The film begins shades comedy can’t help avoid thought, looking Giamatti’s face. But soon realise director Richard J Lewis draw caricatures characters. That’s biggest strength film - think situation hinting going comic highway, screenplay pulls brakes right there. Dustin Hoffman, plays Barney’s father, retired detective adds much colour proceedings (the ‘meet-your-parents’ dinner, Barney’s wedding cemetery scenes memorable), never forces wit conversations. Instead Barney seen confronting life’s challenges pinch salt. That’s kind father, one would love have. What begins look like memoir, ultimately lands alleys mush, head-over-heels romance, marriage raising kids. It’s exactly I expected film, something I’d mind. By keeping focus film important part life, marriage - screenplay find focus. Barney’s story falling love one cutest chapters film. Miriam (Rosamund Pike) perfect Barney’s companion character, understanding wife (but point) essayed well screenplay. This clearly Giamatti’s best performance. He undergone meticulous make-up (especially beard) portray different periods life stage, seems wonderful character. I felt mouth open shock, crucial outburst scene. What makes stand-out easy identify with, totality, Barney like one us - sometimes goes extra length achieve things, sometimes insecure, drinks bit much alright, truthful. He make mistakes regrets later. Sometimes lucky sometime gets nailed. Not direction help bring shades beautifully, wonderful editing (Susan Shipton) helps. The fade-ins dissolves seem neat trimmed, perfect finishes every small chapter film. It’s pity film sink without trace thanks poor publicity. It’s got acclaim film festivals award shows, Golden Globe winner Paul Giamatti exactly household name amongst Indian audiences. Expect day shows cancelled multiplexes, people turn up. In order happen, I recommend go watch one! You’ll enjoy Barney’s life story.
