Every while; come across film promises something, yet turns entirely different. Happy Journey falls category, thankfully pleasant way. Its trailer tries straightforward. The film, rather, deals journey self-discovery, filled complexities. It surpasses expectations set trailer, also manages surprise every then. It won’t overstatement I call achievement; considering fact film free conventionalism. After forgettable Aiyyaa, Sachin Kundalkar brings heart-warming tale two siblings. Niranjan (played impeccably Atul Kulkarni), kid, sent Dubai financially support family. As result, hardly met sister Janaki years. They meet unusual circumstances set extraordinary journey life. Just like many films genre, Happy Journey chooses path physical journey. But makes film unique it’s emotional journey-. The writer-director makes laugh even utterly serious situation leaves speechless least expect it. He strikes perfect balance situational humour emotional bond ease. This actually tells level efforts went behind film’s writing. Self-discovery films usually land making melodramatic philosophical statements. This story strongly avoids it, rightfully so. Kundalkar understands protagonists’ world well. He doesn’t let focus slip away. Although Pallavi Subhash’s Goan accent initially gets little hard adjust to, brilliantly. Secondary characters flimsy moments, however, expose director's vulnerability. It undeniably regrettable. Another prominent aspect refreshingly beautiful story coming-of-age relationship brother sister. I don’t remember sister convincingly bold, especially Marathi film. Priya Bapat delightfully lives role. Shalmali Kholgade’s soulful lullaby – Aakash Jhale, adds heart-rending layer character. Happy Journey looks gorgeous, yet cinematic beauty remains evident parts. Nevertheless, film joyful experience can’t afford go journey.
