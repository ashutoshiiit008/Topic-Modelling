Some films bother conceptual level. Youngistaan claims represent youth I shudder thought youth - I - shallow superficial approach problems national level. What I want representative government? Only lookout? Only whether point view represented? I don't think so. I want generally good society whole. But, Youngistaan created Prime Minister thinks way way go. I consider pretty liberal so, I don't really care Prime Minister's girlfriend problems daddy issues. Everyone them, human, allowed too. Am I okay live-in relationship? Now, liberalism put test. I okay friends, role model. Hey, wait! In film future country, I even asking question? Fine, Youngistaan doesn't talk issue. From huge ocean politics two quarter topics pick change calculation rate interest loans particular range people, scam sort, quarter nod farmer suicides. The accountant couldn't resist laughing implications interest rate change PM Abhimanyu Kaul (Jackky Bhagnani). The build scam led something standard (I know, it's sad something like standard scam) wonder big issue was. The look surprise mentioned PM agriculture main sector, actually insulting. His superficial solution, makes feel worse. Then consider moment Youngistaan story 28 year old boy emotionally blackmailed becoming prime minister country. But doesn't work way either. It loses battle name itself, right? It wants represent youth. It individual's story yet spends much time love life individual trying deal national crises via jingoism, course. A storyline premise would difficult sell even best actors disposal. Jackky Bhagnani come across sincere. But little time spent writing character important, like I said, I doubt actor could've helped. Same goes Neha Sharma who's supposedly supportive girlfriend. Again, wonderful chance writing layered character wasted. A similar waste talent Farouque Shaikh. May soul rest peace. Sure, attempt trying something new. It feel flat face, least tried. Oh well.
