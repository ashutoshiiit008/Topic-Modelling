Sixteen tries cool effort shows. The labour effort requires shows every department film good way. It's film everyone trying best, unfortunately best mediocre. Sixteen gives air importance. A sense making crucial points. But disconnected manner, trying symbolise disconnect characters towards things around them. This doesn't allow feel them. Maybe sixteen year olds identify characters, I sure anyone going find half-way affection. The first put-off dialogue delivery actors, except maybe Zakir Hussain. The three lead ladies drawl annoying first becomes drab. It doesn't help dubbing completely off. There drunk scene Wamiqa Gabbi plays Tanisha shows scope something regular drawl that's little shake lazy way lines said. The sad bit potential. Some story lines, especially Tanisha paying guest (Keith Sequeira), enough material make film itself. But, writers burden keeping stories going editors shabbier job sticking together. Sequences literally stuck together. There times conversation potential get deep, introspective interesting despite awful dialogue delivery fizzles out. Anyway, I sure it'd helped broad stroke every single sixteen year old weird shade cool. I know bunch 15-16 year olds. They confident, arrogant even. They don't value money much age. But, I doubt kids shown Sixteen. Of course, I don't deny teenagers tend casual attitude towards everything around them, can't true them. Where represented Sixteen? And film kids, characters pretty much same, give take. Then again, maybe real-life teenagers another side adults don't know about, like parents film.
