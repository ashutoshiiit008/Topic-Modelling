The movie claims whites love hate browns. So, browns hate whites right back! First, claim true. Don't tell whites browns don't befriend all. Second, given racism exist, need fodder? Way many characters inserted sake representing stereotype, including Bangladeshi takes beating ignored time. Merely perfunctory. The motivation behind character's metamorphosis supposedly powerful, however clichéd, dialogue. Barring 2-3 funny lines, rest either lame, preachy, boring above. The story run-of-the-mill underdog story. No surprises there, promos said all. Also, says many words, serves "us vs. them" agenda, rather story underdogs. I open aware injustice done people elsewhere, I couldn't sympathize characters here. The screenplay consciously follows pattern. Comic scene followed emotional scene followed lighter one repeat. The pattern doesn’t rhythm. They flow other, chop other. Was editing all? I mean necessary join one scene other? I recall least 3 scenes served purpose giving John Abraham screen time. And scenes Boman Irani, almost Bipasha Basu's scenes. John seems added range expressions. I enjoyed attitude first scenes him. But later, wore off. Boman made yell overact occasion. Anyways character strong enough make care. Bipasha - well character all. Oops...that I meant come out, know I mean. A non-male needed story sell, spend make-up clothes. Who extra money time spend characterization, etc? Let's make giggle smile out. A sports movie tremendous scope cameraman. Especially game fast movements, like football. But opportunity utilized fullest. We get nothing spectacular. Not mention football action scenes unsuccessful deception - plain stunt doubles. And non-football field scenes shabbily shot. The music lyrics average too. In fact, realizing Javed Akhtar wrote, "Hey dude, don't mess me" team doesn't believe sad. However, Choreography "billo" nice. But, means end. The movie wouldn't worked, even various departments movie making handled well. Sports movies India generally made around invoking kind patriotism. I saying stop that. But, would I care county league England goodness sake!? My patriotism nudged woes "browns" settled abroad personal progress. Don't get wrong, I certainly nothing people migrating. In fact, learning better exposure different way living. But, immigrants choose live purpose positives outweigh negatives. A huge percentage South Asians staying abroad identify movie. And I don't romantic view world I would deny existence racism. But, world portrayed imagery lives closed minds. By minds enjoy nurturing "oooh-look-at-me-I-am-marginalised" feeling. How many people population well lives complain racism? How many people well would well countries? Ironically, see ad featuring Shah Rukh Khan UK street - means people recognize big enough important mass. Is aim reduce racism fan further? Sports many-a-time borders war real life. Do need movies too?
