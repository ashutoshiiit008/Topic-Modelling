Raja Natwarlal interesting twists edge-of-the-seat moments. But fact person soup gets way easily, person supposed duped conned easily utlimate climax little simplistic - take away thrills set-up. It engage fizzle soon. A prime example climax. The build-up climax truly engaging. It appropriate twists, perfect measure hero caught tight spot, really want know going squeeze one, climax lame gets. An anti-climax sorts. These dips reasonable high comes across lazy writing. Given hardly effort spent according depth characters, dialogue simple except lines Paresh Rawal's character, high thrilling situations thing makes story kick. It unfortunate, film one best cliff-hangers I seen interval, isn't able retain interest. Emraan Hashmi Paresh Rawal perfectly pose smart Alek experienced conman respectively. Paresh Rawal's introduction fact equally amusing cool - kind arrogance smart think deserved. But, doesn't get show much later film. Kay Kay Menon starts menacing character later tones down. Though makes bits given him, used expecting now. Humaima Malick brings nothing table terms performance. In fact, Deepak Tijori short, restrained yet comfortable appearance leaves longer impression. The main problem Raja Natwarlal different conman films used to. Yes, unfortunately, "different" goes film. It takes seriously. Other films genre like Bluffmaster Bunty Aur Babli slick, sweet humor doesn't allow story dip. Even Khosla Ka Ghosla, fact - also suffers problem smart businessman turning gullible suit story's requirement - subtle humor keeps smile intact. Even so, Raja Natwarlal casual TV watch won't regret. Especially, since forward/switch channels run-time lengthening, otherwise irrelevant songs show up.
