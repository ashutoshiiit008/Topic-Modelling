What Robin Hood's father didn't know good things judged looting others? Maybe it'd make interesting story, dealt that. Unfortunately, Boss starts simple complicates things beyond comprehension. To make matters manifold worse, Robin Hood, Satya (Akshay Kumar) spouts inane dialogue look cool; laughs poor jokes; literally sings praises (just case hadn't guessed finger rings); generally way full himself. The saving grace doesn't lead lady show piece. I guess, could take offense makers film didn't even bother role lead lady all. But going skimpily written Ankita (Aditi Rao Hydari), I guess worked best isn't lead lady. Especially, given Sonakshi Sinha's cameo recall value Aditi's entire role. And I wouldn't blame Aditi's performance it. The writing department doesn't care enough taken seriously. With numerous complications added fill story, writing completely loses track starts. For example, Satya Shiv's maternal uncle (Johny Lever) suddenly behaves like stranger scene second half film. With glaring mistakes, attention detail way much ask for. Only aim seems give Akshay Kumar screen time. Interestingly enough, Akshay Kumar shows screen 30 minutes film. I wonder reasons might been. But, comes, typical hamming stays. Till little snippets Shiv Pandit try best make impact. But, Ronit Roy stays memory. He fierceness villain pitted boisterous Satya/Akshay Kumar needs. Yet, role ill-defined unidimensional instill fear. Sure, couple scenes make laugh loud - silly beyond words witty. Also, first one two action sequences Ronit Roy brash enough make notice. Otherwise though, out-of-place film references, worse placed songs over-the-top dialogues name entertainment. I really wonder one doesn't get bored kinds role one other. Maybe different roles performed old way. Or maybe roles aren't defined enough different similar. Goodness knows.
