The Watchmen long remained one inaccessible graphic novels, inaccessible came transposing big screen. The novel dense, multi textured, works least three levels. It plot highly nuanced extremely well detailed, characters far cry standard “super hero” genre, themes remain extremely contemporary disturbing. The audience movie would clearly divided two, read novel would want replicated tiniest detail, would see film “normal” viewers. The former would legions hordes fans analysed discussed novel symbolisms, allusions, connotations ad nauseam, latter would large clue encounter. I belong first group therefore really difficult write film “normal” viewer. Comparisons novel unavoidable, I tried restrict minimum. Let start screen play. The novel enough material make mini series, fit big screen format reduced running time less three hours. The screenplay pared essentials help keep plot moving simultaneously introduce us “Watchmen”, group “superheroes”, way multiple back stories flashbacks. A lot detail intricacies sacrificed cinematic convenience. The director tries make packing lot cues every frame; cues help viewer understand universe Watchmen “real”, imagined alternate one. So news paper headlines, images television reference real life incidents 70’s 80’s, TV interviews, presence least five historical characters including Richard Nixon Henry Kissinger. The title sequence ingenious, series sequential images “slow still motion”, depict passing time concomitant changes. The entire title sequence set Bob Dylan’s 'The times Changing', comes well. In fact certain iconic songs used well film, Simon Garfunkel’s 'Sounds Silence' beautifully underscores mood another sequence. What I really loved wailing, wrenching, Jimi Hendrix version Bob Dylan’s apocalyptic 'All along Watchtower', sets mood surreal climax. The acting top notch, actors “unknowns”, barring Billy Crudup plays Dr Manhattan, naked, godlike, blue boot. Crudup’s acting superb, character seems detached human concerns, soft voice facial movements, creates persona comes across vulnerable, powerful, yet deeply human. Malin Akerman Silk Spectre 2 sometimes jarring, well enough, role really demand much. But prize goes Jackie Earl Haley plays Rorschach. He dons mask film, get see face end briefly, hoarse rasping voice set shoulders, conveys uncompromising morality. He aided fact powerful dialogues (mostly voice over) belong him. Director Zach Snyder good CGI, going previous film 300. Here overdo special effects; visual impact Dr Manhattan’s character well done. The film makes effort replicate panels graphic novel far possible visual composition well designed. For “superhero” movie, hardly action scenes, two precise, involving fisticuffs. They seem rather redundant downplayed; movie could easily done without them. The climax rather disappointing movie’s fatal flaw. The climax enough punch, comes across rather tame inconsequential. This could possibly due two reasons; novel atmosphere ambience created matter outcome, could due fact elaborate plot deals larger metaphysical concerns translate well cinematically, well, both. For read novel, film might difficult grasp (this “normal viewer” friends told me). But courage, might well worth effort watch film. The film good, definitely great. One get feel “Watchmen” universe right, hopefully viewing might prompt film goers lay hands money, best graphic novel till date.
