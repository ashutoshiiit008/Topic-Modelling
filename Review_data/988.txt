I theory – truly enjoy Woody Allen film carry bit neuroticism. Like sometimes ask leave brains home mindless entertainers, I suggest carry extra set wit, over-analyses, free-flowing thought little craze order truly enjoy Woody Allen movie. Don’t ask why; step right world. Of course, last films celebratory odes classic cities like London (Cassandra’s Dream), Paris (Midnight Paris), Barcelona (Vicky Christina Barcelona) Rome To Rome With Love, never really leaves behind volley indulgent, neurotic one-liners exploration human emotion. It’s Woody Allen stamp makes film charismatic funny, ought watch film sheer warm feeling heart. In To Rome With Love, continues write on-going love letter Europe, introducing concoction stories make Rome delightful place be. He also categorizes Rome catalyst basic deconstruction human emotions take granted for: love, loyalty simplicity quote few. Every parallel narrative brings characters worlds experience something ordinary, order remind take potential alive granted. Following four separate story lines, film traces different set characters experiences Rome. Expatriates students, Sally Jack (Greta Gerwig Jesse Eisenberg) couple find trouble Sally’s friend Monica (Ellen Page), neurotic, vixen like character. The story pulled looming presence John (Alec Baldwin), meets Jack visiting old neighborhood. John’s presence becomes like older, mature version Jack’s conscience providing witty insights adulterous experience. There’s also small-town couple, Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi), relocate Rome start new life. They get whirl-pooled messy, almost slapstick situation Antonio run prostitute (Penelope Cruz). On hand Milly gets lost city, finds movie set favorite star Luca Salta (Antonia Albanese). Their innocence gets humorously trampled find giving temptation nerves. Perhaps two absurd yet hilarious storylines belong Roberto Benigni (who plays common Roman man called Leopoldo) Fabio Armiliato (playing bathroom opera singer). Each stories confusing, complex ever meandering, you’re running around circles characters aren’t allowed moment retain calm. To Rome With Love throws twisted deductions, well known emotions analyses entertaining watch, nonetheless. Cinematographer Darius Khondji gives us spectacular bird-eye view city it’s cinematic interruptions narrative. Allen establishes flavor Rome well, much like earlier films, makes want experience city first hand. There point film, mishaps (both comical contemplative) occurred, Alec Baldwin says Jesse Eisenberg, “A foolish man said, Stuff happens”. As viewer know potential underplayed sentence To Rome With Love, stuff fact merely happen. But brings well-thought, well-entertained smile face.
