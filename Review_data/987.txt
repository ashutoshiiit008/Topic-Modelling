I nasty reputation crying drop hat sentimental movies. My theory started first viewing Titanic, 1997. I child, unaware tragedy film. I barely connected Rose Jack 8 year old, I cried every remotely emotional moment, virtue overwhelming feeling Titanic imparts with. Nearly 15 years later, 23 year old, I still cried amount watching Titantic 3D. I still felt rush emotions film: anticipation, heart fluttering mush even though I tried fight it. I’ll admit I expecting blown away 3D technology, especially last half hour film, merely remained subtle layer film. However, films shot/projected 3D, Titanic seemed logical choice - mostly grandeur film. The use 3D doesn’t make cringe point, make feel like waste alteration money. The 3D holds gaze – piles delicate plates fall rack, compartment gets flooded water - feel lot closer on-screen happenings. By virtue that, Titanic 3D worth watching big screen. For forgotten film about, it’s revisit 1912 tragedy Titanic. After hit iceberg wee hours morning, “unsinkable” ship Titanic sunk bottom ocean taking close 1500 people. James Cameron’s Titanic portrays love young Rose Jack Dawson meet ship. Theirs clandestine affair, belong different social backgrounds. Rose aristocratic, fiancé. Her life already decided age 17. She meets Jack, vagabond artist changes perception life. Its puppy love best – also first ever memories love seen big screen (atleast generation). Along Celine Dion’s 'My Heart Will Go On', entire package became sort anthem love us. I remembered telling 10 year old I want marry someone like Jack. Surprisingly, I saw film time, I still 10-year-old girl. That’s beauty Titanic. It wraps story doesn’t let age 3 half hours runs. Titanic film – it’s timeless pop-cultural reference every movie lover. No matter much talk it, still discuss reminisce. Nobody dare called melodramatic released – I’m sure last mind watch big screen melodrama. Sure, visuals background music grand, small part sinks Titanic. It’s part continuously haunt every time watch film, James Cameron banked emotion re-release film. Watch Titanic 3D every reason watched first time around, every time glued came TV. You might feel anything new, walk warm feeling heart.
