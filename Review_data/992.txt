A film main characters find load cash huge potential characters reaction windfall. Even standard one good guy wants nothing it, another outright criminal intent, couple in-betweens, enough scope make intense character fight. But, Toss takes route, making full-fledged whodunit thriller. Fair enough. But outlives welcome creating suspicion character. While it's interesting bit, gets tiring want done with. Toss depiction darkest side humans. Enter money matters everything else goes toss - love, friendship, honesty. And selfishness takes within blink eye. Perfectly humane characters turn cold-blooded murderers worst kind - kind kill friends without remorse. To add darkness sudden spurts comedy take away thrill achieved far. Maybe happens, isn't enough development convincing. Also, even innate beauty leaving questions unanswered, feel like lapse writing intentional part art. Also films villains heroes token heroes leave one care for. As display enough there's display kids getting kick torturing humans. That might way nature made us sensitivity completely missing here. So, thrills get cumbersome characters aren't appealing viewer left with? Performances, right? Out lot, Prashant Raj seemed one took job seriously. Even dubbing totally women, one contributing factors out-and-out shoddy job done all. However nice see Sushant Singh diffident character. Despite general lack talent acting department, commendable none characters loud. Except course, Rajpal Yadav spoils little decorum quirkiness bit-role. The wannabe cool shots, especially close-ups random objects meant inspire fear, reminded RGV's Phoonk. Also, though background music abrupt many places, spots strings used sound different nice. But consistent music bit overwhelming. Not mention Bhangra song place pleasure listen to. It looked like opportunity missed could edge-of-the-seat noir depiction us people. The main culprit, despite lack attention writing, length. You could take one remote aide.
