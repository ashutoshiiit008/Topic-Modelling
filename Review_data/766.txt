Period films voiceovers presumably share unbridled equation industry. If unwritten rulebook anything go by, film carry salute star’s voiceover beginning. I assumed well entering cinema hall. However Razzakar follows others’ footsteps rather disappointingly. I honestly grudge (consider Queen example), badly abused narrative clearly signals lack creative force behind storytelling. Let’s talk film’s idea - it’s clear-cut portrayal Hyderabad Liberation Movement erupted 1948. Razzakars private militia formed Nizam Hyderabad, said tortured brutally killed thousands people supported state’s merger dominion India. The film, however, chooses get multi-layered political crisis. It instead depicts village’s importantly protagonist's struggle Razzakars – fair enough. Possibly Razzakars’ early representation Marathi cinema, lot riding it. The film disappoints parts, every possible way. Although saddens failure get act right even relatively smaller scale. Characters drive screenplay written amateurishly – let alone portrayal – whole film appears forcible throughout. The done-to-death recurrence – three, elderly villagers discussing arrival Razzakars village freedom fighter wanting martyr given situation man whose jaw wide open every – make regrettable hilarity. But all, unwarranted instillation love story signifies immature writing-direction rather evidently. Every character performs erratically apparent reason causing confusion. A hen binding story together simply outstanding, though I unconvinced shoddy depiction. The director fails make hen intensify antagonist (Zakir Hussain) opening scene, making appear flat rather fearsome. The makers resort number comic moments hold attention, lack conviction though deadens it. Another crucial aspect bothers much film’s script not-so-terrifying violence. Razzakar Hyderabad’s burning past; despite on-screen violence involving countless killings, homes set fire, bloodshed throat-slitting, looks half-baked. The so-called goriness, mostly tried visual effects, doesn’t evoke emotions. Inferior production design another low point film. After all, it’s hard coming terms symmetrically-well-designed houses, plastic mini flags glossy flags 1948. This could also film’s story offering creative room deepen otherwise dull setting. Historic films nowadays history textbooks school. Both end boring you, regardless boasting adventurous moments. I couldn’t connect Siddharth Jadhav’s peculiar character. His efforts indeed deserve appreciation, considering manner entertains nowhere. His diligent performance, hand, draws sympathy without necessity. Razzakar suffers poor characterization, dull portrayal passé dialogues. There one single scene debutant director looks promising. And lack experience doesn’t justify insipid display.
