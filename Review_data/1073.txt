You know word sequels? The one worse first series. Well, know verdict Yamla Pagla Deewana was. All say Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 stays true genre, "sequels". Okay maybe, plot little coherent Yamla Pagla Deewana. But, comparison pretty much pointless considering Yamla Pagla Deewana didn't plot all. The performances brand loud over-the-top, good enough make actors look like fools prancing around. Once again, heart goes Anupam Kher time even Annu Kapoor reduced roles. Interestingly, Sunny Deol one gives tries pull film along. As far action comedy go, I clue action would excite would laugh jokes get excited. There always element laughing at, "so silly cannot laugh" films type. Fortunately unfortunately, Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 element, wanes two half minutes. While watching film, thing I cringing thought might Yamla Pagla Deewana 3. There Yamla Pagla Deewana 2, right? What going stop third one coming along? shudder
