I remember Minnale (Lightning) first Tamil film I attempted watch without subtitles. I’ll honest tell reason I I’ve seen Hindi remake 100 times (Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein). My heroic act fell flat fervor fellow Tamilian friend’s wise words – “I hope you’re watching Gautam Menon film without subtitles. Half movie English anyway.” There's point behind bringing incident – Gautam Menon household name parts South India films like Kakka Kakka, VinnaiThandi Varuvaya Varanam Aayiram. His films work certain universal quality it, still manage retain socio-cultural flavor roots. Minnale, however, different later films, strong themes hard-cutting performances. It’s simple, run-off-the-mill story guy tries woo girl saw fell love with. One Madhavan’s earlier films, Minnale, plays charming role. Genuinely smitten Reena (Reemma Sen), convinces mad love, camera runs road, like love-struck maniac even so, wants pull hair he’s “whipped”, put colloquially. This portrayal works because, film released 2000, see romance staying away cheesy songs loud expressions. This achieved mainly every performance, Madhavan, Reemma Aabas believable fresh. Through film feel like you’re listening "how-this-happened" story friend tells coffee you’re catching years. It brings bright smile anticipation face – see film unfold. Personally, I would preferred heroine brighter face Reemma Sen. She tendency look bored sometimes. Madhavan’s witty grandfather Subunni (Nagesh) plays charming performance father figure supports feelings full rigour. Madhavan’s best friend Chokalingam (Vivek) adds sense comic relief, something central South Indian films. The music film tells half story, really. Harris Jayaraj’s first film composer probably best soundtrack till date. The songs heart-warming, hummable go well flavor film. The entire package makes want wish lead couple, could part romance next-door. When I first picked DVD Minnale, I bit alert. While DVD feature such, heard many people praise film dud Hindi, I wanted mentally compare. Technically, subtitles DVD comprehensible (yes, I checked) help making see sense purity film incorporated. Simply put, Minnale blew away. It’s simple, charming much unlike Hindi counterpart borders corny, watered version film. Minnale, however, strong personality film – like old, yellowed letter find written blunt pencil. It doesn’t matter language used, focus you’ll read pristine love story dominated somebody’s life. Much like stroke lightening; happens once.
