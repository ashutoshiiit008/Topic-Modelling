Three things strike immediately take look DVD Despicable Me: 1. The cover design fantastic. 2. There special features DVD. 3. The sub-title film, ‘Superbad. Superdad’, pasted alongside ‘gru-some’ looking man three cute kids - almost gives plot away. Gru (voiced Steve Carell), obnoxious inhabitant quiet neighbourhood, army minions (egg-shaped characters voices exactly like Vodafone’s Zoozoos) mad scientist helping steal famous monuments. Well, almost. One day, Pyramids get stolen Vector (Jason Segel), new villain block, Gru intimidated plans make ultimate robbery - shrink moon bring earth. To help succeed, Gru adopts three orphaned kids - Margo, Edith Agnes. Almost moment kids enter Gru’s life, storyline gets extremely predictable. Several films, especially animation, gone pat. Monsters Inc., Ice Age examples immediately come mind. But despite knowing expect, Despicable Me fairly entertaining watch. This Universal Studios’ first 3D animated film although it’s Pixar product, character design animation noteworthy. Some sequences - like rollercoaster scene theme park - would look spectacular 3D, nevertheless enjoyable DVD. But Gru's unique character piqued curiosities first time saw trailers many, took us theaters too. Carell fantastic Gru one can’t help marvel immense work must gone behind getting French accent right. So Gru sound like Steve Carell, rather way around. By standards, that’s achievement voiceovers - something marvelled saw Robin Williams skillfully Mrs Doubtfire. Writers Ken Daurio Cinco Paul less succeed showing Gru’s desperation go moon, flashbacks childhood. The humour film pattern - antics minions slapstick, kids, especially Agnes (Elsie Fisher) generate ‘awww’ moments every line. Given basic plot, parents find certain scenes easy relate mainly parenting lessons Gru learns along way. The closing sequence brings smile face simple joy gives celebrate character Gru. He looks, well... erm...disproportionate, good company, dance really well. Later, nitpick brain Despicable Me didn’t floor completely, there’s important realisation. Animation films clearly set bar high quality entertainment, every film going match (Many trying, that’s good thing.) But would fair say without drawing many comparisons, Gru kids’ antics far better value money movies released year.
