After little gem Gabhricha Paus, director Satish Manwar returns Tuhya Dharma Koncha? (What’s religion?), story tribal family lives little village fringes Tiger Reserve Melghat. Despite brave choice story - interesting pertinent one means - film let poor production value and, importantly lack true emotional heft. Kavadu, tribal villager, arrested police crime didn’t commit. While jail, wife Bhulabai, already encumbered responsibility two children, one ailing infant, also run pillar post trying get Kavadu out. In dealing problems, invariably turn band Naxalites, Christian missionary priest help. As story progresses, question invariably poses one asked title film. What immediately strikes Tuhya Dharma Koncha?? lack production value. Obviously, budget constraints always plague film genuinely tries different without catering mass audience. But largely static camera groups people like villagers, Naxals Christians numbering handfuls, film ends feeling like theatre cinema. The film also fairly flat graph throughout. You always watching suffering tribal family rural Maharashtra, never escalates enough grab throat. It always maintains certain distance viewer. While clear lack attempt infusing additional drama narrative probably directorial choice – indeed mature one case – fact remains fails establish strong emotional connect audience. The film also simplistic treatment groups I mentioned above. The Hindus, clearly consumed rituals, festivals tokenism sort progressive outlook; Naxals one point militant communist agenda; Christians open outlook, derivative Western influences religion – painted broad strokes, something doesn’t really justice complex socio-political situations melting pot groups would doubtlessly create. Also, film doesn’t attempt provide sort resolution important question asks title – again, choice made filmmakers, one underlines fact film maintains chasm audience, would want take something away food thought film like this. The prime reason film doesn’t completely fail engaging audience performance cast. Upendra Limaye, plays Kavadu, fine actor. He really well portrays anguish innocent man locked prison. Vibhawari Deshpande Bhulabai convincing almost gullible emotionally strong wife, doesn’t hesitate needs done sake family. Kishor Kadam priest fair job well, though performances seem rarely differ one another. Also, entire cast well director must lauded use tribal Marathi dialect film. While adds disconnect viewer extent, also actually aid make concentrate decipher them. (The film didn’t subtitles hall I watched it.) Director Satish Manwar clearly brave man intends continue telling stories parts Maharashtra hidden cosmopolitanism progress associated Pune – Mumbai – Nashik triangle. Indeed, us forget large part Maharashtra remains one under-developed areas country. So I hope Manwar continues making films show harshness life regions. For attempt alone, Tuhya Dharma Koncha? must supported, even though film largely remains surface-level exploration role religion plays time one religion fulfill needs man, one attempts delve deep.
