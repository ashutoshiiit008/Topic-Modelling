We live rather tame lives, really think it. Years conditioning what's right what's wrong; pangs guilt or, alternatively, adrenaline rush one gets one crosses moral 'line'; passing moral judgements other; penance one's 'sins'; works. Humanity lives code ethics that, least part, seems work us. But then, really writes 'code'? Who makes rules, go fundamental premise humankind equal, who's say defines right wrong first place? After all, one man's food another man's poison. Consequently, always live life rules, notions morality damned. These people, usually, ones aren't accountable Aston Martins. Enter Jordan Belfort - Wall Street stockbroker salesman extraordinaire - man made millions laundering fraudulent stocks unsuspecting investors. A self-styled Robin Hood took wealth rich gave to... Himself! A man made much money didn't mind throwing cash trash, kicks. Based book 'The Wolf Wall Street' written real life Belfort himself, Martin Scorsese's film adaptation scamster's life astonishingly audacious piece cinema - content well execution. With film largely based fact, one can't help overwhelmed obscene Belfort's greed, depravity, lasciviousness lust money was; lust grew bigger additional million made. Jordan Belfort didn't push limits morality, ignored completely, seeming live alternate dimension morality concept didn't exist. Then there's Martin Scorsese done Belfort's story. Call glorification, call treating serious issue far lighter tone considered appropriate, call sheer masterclass adopting cinematic style work best written word - either way, Scorsese knocks one park way can. Directed kind fervent energy one hasn't seen great man while, The Wolf Wall Street cinema crack. Outrageously funny, incredibly daring terms never shies away going deeper deeper realms 'immorality', briskly paced extent one never realizes monstrous runtime, phenomenally performed boot, The Wolf Wall Street either fun you've cinemas while, vulgarity Belfort's excesses begin get you, also taxing experience recent times. Because make mistake, neither Martin Scorsese terrific cast held back one; they've gone bring characters make question everything believe in. Sex, violence, drugs, language, corruption, immorality everything considered taboo actually celebrated uncontrolled licentiousness film. In fact, despite fact film released India good six minutes chopped off, I still couldn't help wonder censors mature enough let film release - I'm complaining. It rated adult film, obviously, I know fact even many 'adults' find hard stomach level all-round immodest extravagance sin depicted film. Of cast, Leonardo DiCaprio Jordan Belfort Jonah Hill aide Donnie give characters unbridled all. DiCaprio, particular, must saluted pumping Belfort quality makes seem 'normal', despite excesses. They someone despise, never allowed take moral stance them. DiCaprio - Scorsese, course, - make unsuspecting participant everything would ideally consider 'wrong', consequently shakes moral high ground, bringing self-righteousness crashing down. Questions asked, course. Is right glorify something obviously 'wrong'? Should stronger focus highlighting sin must always atoned for; karma come back bite backside day? Is film like The Wolf Wall Street irresponsible towards society, seems make heroes people considered villains? These points view, which, important talk about, actually disservice intent film altogether. Because, whether like not, world clearly run Belforts - ones 'more equal' others. Scorsese daringly shows us even people human, making enjoyable film Belfort's story, shows us Jordan Belfort's shoes, would probably different. We're all, way other, wolves human clothing.
