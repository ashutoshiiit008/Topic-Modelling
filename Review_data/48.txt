The foreplay religious, political, administrative systems sickening parts country. Nothing new. But every while, film comes reminds 7th page news item dismissed nod helplessness. Throughout Aakrosh want ask question, "how local goons/politicians/police get away it?" And every time film reminds horrifying nexus barely shakes something commoners call "HUGE" scam. We see world deteriorated legal system Bihar eyes CBI investigators played Ajay Devgn Akshay Khanna. They frustrated left aghast situation, audience. This issue "honor killing" barely talked about. In fact, it's assumed audience knows issue is. The reason atrocities less left imagination. So people expecting ruthless bigotry won't see that. But ruthlessness, they'll see sure. This ambiguous justification might well intentional. The issue could anything, vulnerability powerless, all, same. Only words like helpless defenseless come mind see massacre wonder, "is fighting cause, however valid worth it?" Sure, cause might worth fight for. But fighting ends killing hopes people hope belongs to, fight for? The fact I spend three paragraphs discussing issue says Priyadarshan hit nail. The direction smart razor-sharp. The joy seeing director, many awful films name, make brilliant camera decisions inexpressible. Because guidance, I witnessed best performances actors I've always admired. Amongst many villains society, policeman Paresh Rawal plays one want see beaten pulp. Such emotion actor I look forward watching - judge power act. We've seen Ajay Devgn similar roles, want more, even it's him. True, antics Spiderman James Bond make laugh. Though it's done well, occasional 'whoa' make escape mouth. If action fit genre social awakening. The rest cast bit, albeit necessarily impressively. Any non-actor could easily played Akshaye Khanna Bipasha Basu wouldn't know difference. Also characters aren't detailed. While Bipasha Basu's character might serve purpose giving backstory characters, Akshaye Khanna's character's purpose seems echo thoughts, thoughts city-bred audience. A person explanation given, audience's question also answered. The flaw writing flow scenes. The events look disjointed. While things somewhat acceptable, songs abrupt placement film unforgivable. Not obviously gratuitous, completely ruin build situation. This also true scenes pauses last seconds camera lingers longer necessary. They make otherwise well-paced film seem sluggish. Yet, well worth buck Aakrosh well-shot chase sequences - foot, cycles cars. Meanwhile, issue raised something talked often. Even people aren't killed often, far many couples either part ways/live difficult life belong different caste/region/religion. Nothing proud of, needs documented. Hopefully future generations able take pride fact evolved human beings.
