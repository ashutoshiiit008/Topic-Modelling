Each character sketch stereotype. Each dialogue sharp smart works towards setting stereotype deeper mould. Not word wasted. Each member cast playing role tee. And yet, something amiss. I make long list things I like. But two hours later I still unable articulate exactly didn’t make instant hit. It “laugh-my-heart-out” type comedy. But satirical elements kept smile face entire duration. All characters close real-life; enough freely available one us encounter point lives. Each one course, exaggerated tinge underline sarcasm. Jabs taken many social double standards. It type humor I enjoy, subtle, tongue-in-cheek types. But yet, felt incomplete. The overall idea pretty cool. What could viewers want? A reality show, done less 90 minutes instead 19 weeks. No safety circles unnecessary tension filled eliminations! However, details story seem - little flat. There particular ups downs. But, again, ever said every story needs arch? Also, many ups downs lives go weekend? So, simplistic sense story bad either, leaves something wanting. There finer details seem unrealistic otherwise authentic setting. I must say though, one amusing anti-climatic climax. Acting, one all, absolutely outstanding. No one better veteran Shabana Azmi cast list. But, Manish Acharya (he also director) marvelous job playing nerd - self-absorbed yet conscious misfit, coy boy clue deal women. Technically stood minimal use background music camera movement. Like many things life, don’t makes things better. Realistic characters, realistic setting, yet story completely believable. All-in-all, “relaxed Sunday afternoon home” movie “rush theater instant” one.
