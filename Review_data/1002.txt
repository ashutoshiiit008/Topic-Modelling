The first effect Triumph Of The Will produced me, make temporarily forget Adolf Hitler’s crimes, simply bowling oratory skills speeches documentary full of. Indeed, speaker world seen, crack silly moustache, yet mobilize entire nation act per command. The second effect: An immense admiration film’s female director, Leni Riefenstahl (pronounced Ree-fen-staal) commissioned Hitler make film. Triumph Of The Will documents Hitler’s visit Nuremberg attend Nazi Party Congress, manner Riefenstahl captured grandeur visit, wow-worthy. Not scale, also employment camera technique aesthetics - stuff perhaps woman’s eye uniquely observe. I say this, succeeds making Hitler handsome, someone looks charge people. Right introductory scenes Hitler’s aircraft floats clouds, shadow passing streets Nuremberg like blessing, descent eventual appearance front supporters - feels God emerged doors plane. Riefenstahl well hold attention right upfront. Just think may turn yet another film filled grainy, fast-forward worthy footage history, you’re surprised see well-preserved material still (a big pat back Enlighten Film Society making available India). Riefenstahl’s crew shot four-day Congress process, collected 60 hours footage. The 109 minutes finally see film mix Hitler’s speeches made day, Republic Day-kinda parade presented displaying might German artillery Youth Army. There rare moments too: spot Hitler smile also witness getting humbled support. His speeches undoubtedly fiery manner they’ve shot, nothing short Obama address. He often erected podium high air, resulting effect seems resemble religious address Pope. Hitler however, speaks without reference material front him. He talks right heart much passion, fear moustache might explode bits, teeth might crunch pieces. His comments highly provocative, prejudiced, sense patriotism unique, almost equating religion sorts. Throughout film, camera fine job capturing people’s reactions, tight close-ups - Youth Army poised attention, little kids playing drums band like tomorrow. A chill ran spine thinking kids young men would dead now. This film accomplishment cinematic technique, managing pull grand event nature - woman film-maker then, man’s world. The agile camera movements, tight tracking frames Hitler, obsession finding textures sea army men walking discipline, low-angle shots providing Hitler Godly halo - tie well together give enough justification one greatest propaganda films time. Leni Reifenstahl, actress herself, made film Hitler’s request. Although skeptical beginning, since didn’t understand importance Hitler’s visit visit’s political implications, agreed Fuhrer, self-confessed admirer work, convinced wanted artistic viewpoint shooting proceedings. In hindsight, seems like great decision, proved detrimental advancement Riefenstahl’s career. She came known Nazi pin-up girl despite breaking new ground filming technique every film, critics always ended pointing fascist tendencies work. Which why, Triumph Of The Will significant film course cinematic history. It covers Hitler’s crimes well, sealing all, ritual German worship great dictator. But also dug coffin extremely talented film-maker, today credited inventing enhancing innovations like underwater photography. Parts film certain bore - like never-ending parades on-going orchestra, forms background score. But watching Hitler microphone weird experience - mix amusement, admiration hatred. That’s feeling men world generate.
