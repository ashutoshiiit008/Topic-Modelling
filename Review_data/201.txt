It's unlikely kids smartass nickname every-single-body know (including apartment complex live in). For sure, kids take powerful politicians think right. But neither kids solve mysteries like Famous Five Secret Seven. Chillar Party story. It asks us think grown into, innocent, straightforward children were. Chillar Party doesn't preach, keeps things simple that's worked me, especially climax. It hits right amount. And gets right spot too. A bunch kids middle class families fall love homeless child dog. The stage set one regular, "I'm sorry you, I need help you" story (very similar Zor Laga Ke Haiyya). Which translates - stage set kids acting old age, preaching adults always wrong, etc. This, turn, translates lot yawning. But, Chillar Party begins surprise you. The surprises begin little things. For example, overt sympathy towards child less fortunate. He earns sympathy deserves, one bit another. And play. The Chillar Party gets instant success, share struggle. Children behave way children likely behave. Well, almost. Of course, it's difficult accept kids start revolution. But times internet candle-light vigils, sure kids can't it? It doesn't really take much make breaking news, it? Parents scold, unreasonable considerate parents usually are. The child-parent even parent-parent interactions flow naturally. Ever society meeting? There particular moment see every dad hero child. But, know dad situation, adults invariably find in, take far away hero. Sure, things Chillar Party tries larger-than-life. But knows capable children. I know kids (ages 7 9) understand concepts though might know words adults use describe them. I know come awesome ideas NOT asked (and asked to, too!). Girls building (ages 6-9) formed "creativity club" first activity make ID cards members. And rule +1 "boys allowed!" Chillar Party adorable cute. Both film, members gang, actors make gang work. The music catchy fun. Kids going ball watching film. And there's hope adults remember film little theater. Especially reminded lessons taught school. No, no, ones "really" useless. The life hacks, teach kids forget follow on. The kids might feel sorry stray dog (Oh, record, I don't even like dogs!). But, adults know Chillar Party something much larger. Us. The world made home.
