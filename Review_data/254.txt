As first scenes unfold I try imagine understandable reaction audience fed mainstream Hindi cinema. "Titillating!", "Voyeuristic!!", "Despicable!!!" Maybe audiences exposed cinema world similar reaction too. This 'our' movies. So almost every movie boasts pole-dance name 'item number' suggestive lyrics?! Even so, I'd agreed characters Dev D didn't move beyond basic needs, didn't try understand other. Or didn't reasonable motivation. Or they, like normal human beings, didn't move one pain another. It's there. Not completely satisfying, it's there. Not entirely smoothly introduced characters. Even though us might identify them, begin enjoy them. The offense Indian psyche starts onslaught guy adamant outright disrespectful towards elders. A girl love go extent please man. Another frustrated, violated, unloved teenager rebels friends family desert her. Each one strong character. And three condemn self-destruction - even one takes socially acceptable path. But, something goes wrong. The writing terms story loses charm mid-way. The strong characters turn limp writers lost interest. Fortunately dialogue stays crisp smart. But, foreplay doesn't lead anything exciting. No home-run third base? Tut-tut....It's culture express sexuality. We urge. 1,00,00,00,000 don't happen like that! But, Shushhh! We purge need talk it. And three main characters lusting like there's tomorrow - big screen that! Scandalous!! But, HOLD ON...It's explicit implication expression. Not much kiss us make fuss about. And yet comes across imprudent. Sure language refreshingly candid. It's exactly everyday language people think feet like that. And sets Dev D apart. It's almost camera waiting nudge, pushed capture might happening bush. But makers enjoy teasing audience better. Of course, also helps escaping censor scissor. It's Anurag Kashyap movie. By definition try show society mirror. He comments double standards men spells dialogue, case trying overlook it. The film talks sex obsession, also form possession - person mine he/she makes love me. It drills angst songs. Almost constantly, words background song telling something insightful care pay attention. Incidentally, first time I saw audience singing song loud theater. How I leave Abhay Deol's charm dialogue delivery skills out? O-kay, smile dimples too! Yet character, Dev's attitude made want slap him. Maybe portrays Dev's audacity well, maybe Mahie Gill played Paro wasn't effort involved. I didn't need understand much Punjabi know girl's mind! Am I one felt like I watching Tabu? However, chemistry Abhay Mahie completely missing Kalki Koechlin Abhay get together. Kalki didn't seem 100% comfortable thus looked little pretentious. Dev D represents urban youth go today. Their candor, confidence, conceit, sexual desires, redefinition true love. Itâ€™s story told retold decades, literature screen. But it's open, bold. Unfortunately, also feels like it's half-told.
