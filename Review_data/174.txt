I couldn't review Bubble Gum didn’t release Pune. And shame is, guest reviewer IdeaSmith loved really good things say it. Here's hoping catch it. - meetu * When promos Bubble Gum first flashed TV screen, I changed channel. I figured title description superficial lives privileged kids date 12, cars 14 passport stamped fashionable destinations, time 16. Indeed, Meetu hadn’t asked guest-review, movie might passed notice. The loss would entirely mine. The promos posters tell story puppy love teenage friendships. I’m almost loath say since would go counter reviewing without giving movie away (Oh Meetu, hard!). Let start saying perceptions entirely wrong. This bubblegum fancy ‘Oh, I lurrrrve San Francisco, I got tee-shirt Disneyland last visit’ crowd. It’s bubblegum local-brand-chews-like-eraser variety anyone grew India 80s would remember. The story set time mobile phones, satellite television neighborhood coffee bars. Bubble Gum starts simple introduction explains time, one could expect love stolen glimpse beloved surreptitious hand clasp kabaddi. Bubble Gum explores world 14-year-old, Vedant Jamshedpur days drawing Holi. A grown-up Vedant (who never shown) narrates tale, giving 'The Wonder Years’ feel. The movie touches every aspect boy’s life artfully anyone ever fourteen feel sense kinship. Vedant chafes parental authority, ongoing war arch rival Ratan, sighs deeply pretty girl next door frequently bailed scrapes brother, Vidur. So makes teenager, story special? For starters, first Hindi movie recent times, age group. It’s cutesy monsters-and-noises tale primary school child. Nor teeny-bopper flavour number recent releases, target either older teenagers ‘the cool set’, focusing exclusively puppy love. Infatuation one things concern preteen/early teenager accorded status Bubble Gum. Peer pressure, sibling jealousy detachment parental unit also major aspects young adult’s life Bubble Gumexplores without ever turning preachy predictable. Secondly, every character, even minor one, etched kind detail makes story truly delightful. You watch movie Vedant’s eyes also recognize parents’ dilemma brother’s blind protectiveness. You even feel certain camaraderie roguish, rough-and-ready Ratan. Even characters appear couple scenes add funny nostalgia value make audience think someone like lives - rakhi sister go-between lovers, pushy Bengali mother combing hair balcony, ready take cudgels Partho’s behalf, gulal-seller moonlights goon, baby brother must bribed chocolate, play messenger. One major aspects movie detailed promos keeping theme blog, I won’t mention either. You’ll know see it, first five minutes film. All I’ll say it’s done times Bollywood never quite well this. As turns out, Bubble Gumis screened select theatres. Of multiplexes, PVR Cinemas one Mumbai I could find show even then, single one per theatre morning. There must special screening schools since two groups children present teachers tow audience. You would think theatre full preteen kids would make raucous audience. But movie kept us glued seats, occasional cheer laugh Vedant’s adventures. I thought Bubble Gum would perfect group outing movie bunch preteens. My mother accompanied film, thought would interesting watch parents teenagers. And though neither us part two groups, still immensely enjoyed film.
