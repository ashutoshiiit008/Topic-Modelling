Before I saw movie, fellow reviewer wogma friend, said – “This looks like 'The Burning Train' again.” I similar notions film excited watching it. The promos gave away story – unmanned train carrying highly toxic inflammable chemicals cargo heading high speed towards densely populated area someone stop causes mass destruction. But watch movie, whenever begin think it's predictable boring, movie throws masterfully shot action sequences, complications lead change plans. The movie excels departments action sequences good enough give rush. The complications make think ways overcome them. Most people theatre, talking watching movie, once, didn't annoy me. For one occasions, I friends. We discussed strategies, “Why don't instead?” “They try that!” I believe movie done job well, gets audience engaged. More so, movie, eventually discuss try half ideas floating around theatre. It made story believable (it inspired true story all) made us feel involved. Admittedly, loopholes heroics seen real life. But hey, whats action movie, without heroics, right? The ending might satisfy everyone may make feel bit cheated. There lot chatter discussion forums net, choice actions took movie, could effective. But keep open mind actions prevent disaster taken approval bureaucratic people try play safe situations time crunch always bring best people, you'll thoroughly enjoy movie. Denzel Washington good ever role veteran engineer close retirement. Chris Pine well role newly assigned conductor working family issues. How tragedy makes friends, rocket science, executed well. The direction flawless life soul movie. The train sequences shot masterfully gives plenty edge-of-the-seat, breathtaking moments. The screenplay gets bit course times, since little story play around with; don't feel sticking sore thumb. Dialogues clichéd, straight old-school action films, action makes it. The background score fantastic gives lot depth action sequences. After first fifteen minutes so, movie never hits low. It's thrill ride, unnecessary stunts over-the-top action sequences, makes one best thriller movies recent times. The lighter moments make fun bureaucracy fun watch too. Watch sure, preferably theatre.
