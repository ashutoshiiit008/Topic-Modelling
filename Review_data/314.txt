In tiny, innocuous scene Fandry, almost background, school teacher begins explaining students subtext poem Marathi saint. The poem's title, roughly translated, means, "All seems." Apart tale innocent love wry look caste divides rural India Fandry is, also gentle reminder nothing see hear taken face value; nothing, really, seems. Everyone Fandry chasing something. The dark-skinned son lone 'untouchable' family village - family given filthiest odd jobs - yearns look fairer better. He pines classmate, daughter upper class family. The ones village better dream Mumbai. And Mumbai? Yearning quiet life village perhaps? The cycle endless. Director Nagraj Manjule sometimes chooses subtle symbolism puts blatantly front times, exposes frail social structure really is. He never taking film seriously. Fandry, incidentally, means 'pig'; one many symbols used film. Fandry could well termed period film; except 'period' shown film today. Here now. We know, references IPL Facebook. But manner man believes concept superior inferior, ones considered inferior looked upon vile disgust held true since dawn humankind itself, likely continue far future. If think it, seems hard fathom man came concept caste. But millennia conditioning come mean 'lowest' social strata come actually believe belong bottom ladder. So, father lashes son dares dream, refuses conform society expects - village 'untouchable'. Fandry is, thus, heartbreaking. A boy old enough termed 'innocent', young enough dream better life honest sincerity isn't allowed so. You root him, want allowed dream, even almost see dreams well don't stand chance fulfilment. Because, see, represents us. We're prisoners expected us; Jabya, protagonist, symbolizes every one us. Fandry scathing witty equal measure. Shot without frills technical show-boating, concentrates frame, event stands for. The characters real, real means gray. Whether enforced whether free will; character made conform. So, one film's best moments, whole village comes standstill - they're 'expected to'. The it, I'll leave discover. The raw, rural Marathi dialect tricky, helps film subtitled English. It also means film reach wider audience, particularly one rare Marathi films get release outside Maharashtra well. Fandry brutally honest film, one makes smile brood equally. The production design cast play large role creating world you. Somnath Awghade, plays Jabya, plays earnestly, full conviction. He, well boy plays friend, natural, astounds you. Kishore Kadam, tends every film, perfect Jabya's father. He makes feel almost always. Writer-director Nagraj Manjule, also makes charming little cameo village oddball, tells us story universal appeal, manner roots clearly knows best. At crisp 103 minutes, film paced beautifully, simple guitar piece like soul film. Everytime plays, seems like dream - reminds us, there's always something that's reach. Fandry, then, much story Jabya's. True, may live village like him, dreams may his. But then, Manjule keeps reminding us, maybe actually are; nothing seems.
