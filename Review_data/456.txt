I feel like unappeasable audience demands movie-makers. I constantly complain one-dimensional characters. Ishqiya three reasonably well-defined characters visible shades gray yet doesn't give "complete" feeling walking theater. The film made well technically too. The interaction amongst characters takes hit one, difficult understand motivations behavior. After intriguing start, mid-way, film completely changes tone. This leaves disconcerted. Sure, lot characters intentionally mysterious, approach climax, shouldn't least vaguely interpretable rationale. It doesn't even artsy, take-your-own-guess kind-of appeal. It looks like lazy writing. Khaalu-jaan (Naseeruddin Shah) romantic kill, wants to. Babban (Arshad Warsi) thug falls love. Both rugged, men soil. Krishna (Vidya Balan) romantic maintains constant enigma her. She's absolutely convincing seductress knows wants (whether figure out). Once chemistry established awesome actors done wonderful job. But, chemistry happens first place, answers. Also, lot don't background setting film. It either assumed know happens socially politically, around Gorakhpur given feeling supposed matter. Since I don't know Yadavs fighting Thakurs, huge gap dynamics various side characters. And yet lot going means entertainment keeping interested. The spontaneous dialogues delivered perfect timing. The twisted plot engaging - geared towards lame dissatisfying end. Also, propriety plausibility Krishna's behavior huge question mark. "Executing nice story well," easy feat. With unmissable Vishal Bharadwaj feel way story told, lyrical earthy. But story kind-of warped leaves distinct taste discontent. p.s. I wish movie could given higher rating awesome music. All songs, except 'Ibn-e-batuta' exceptional - brilliant music lyrics top that.
