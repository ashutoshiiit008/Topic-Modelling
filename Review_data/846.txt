Pre-emptive Note 1: Akshay Kumar fans - review you, bugger come back brickbats you've seen movie! We're warm one around here. Pre-emptive Note 2: This reviewer brain refuses leave behind more. I part masses take pride using intellect - pseudo not! * * * Phewww! That felt good!!* * * So, pretty much know I'm headed one, right? But, let's fair talk nice things first. The wit induced charming-yet-rugged Punjabi-inflicted-Hindi dialect brings smiles. Akshay Kumar dutiful justice Mr. goody-two-shoes, flat character, like he's ages - nice, dance, preach, dance, dance more. At least character consistent! Puneet's character played Ranveer Shorey refreshing change regular loser, third person love triangle. After long time Hindi cinema, third person spine. He actually seems worthy darling heroine. I also enjoyed Sonu Sood's dead look. And yes course, Katrina Kaif looks charming self. Period. Period good things said. Dubbing must one difficult things actor that's I admire actors manage well. But, Katrina off! We know lady can't speak Hindi. But, doesn't even attempt lip-sync songs!! Not mention, songs off. The lyrics sound like random Panjabi lines strung together. I didn't enjoy music choreography. The picturization couple songs like bad tourism ads Egypt. The raw beauty places captured, attempt made glamorize them. I always thought camera, sound, background score supposed add charm, ambience scene. They supposed produce rhythm, work tune other. But, merely performing function usage wasn't given single thought. So end adding chaos mayhem. I digest woman travels way Australia Cairo study criminal law. I try best question umpteen inconsistent side-characters change view according need particular scene. And I give treatment police bringing underworld Don's friend Australia. I don't question gravity defying parachute. I accept Superman flying, I welcome super-villain make parachute take u-turn. I even smile person holding electrical wire bare hands he's electrocuting others. I satisfy raising brow people consuming alcohol openly *while riding* convertible pre-dominantly Muslim country. Egypt relatively liberal, I say, I'm supposed sit back enjoy. Enjoy what? One person pissing another's face? A table fan threatening crotch? A random scene people playing cricket patchily edited forced two random scenes - third person love triangle get jealous couple end lying trying grab catch? The opening disclaimers included lines effect that, "The hen hen chase scene digitally crafted, cruelty imposed animals shoot scene." Uhh...what cruelty inflicted upon us humans watched tripe name 'mass entertainment'?
