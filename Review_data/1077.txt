*I vacation. Pradeep kind enough review film wogma. So goes... ~ meetu* ---------------------------------------------- In 2009, young 26-year old’s debut directorial film won hearts fresh real seemed (by ‘commercial film’ standards, course) especially considering came Dharma, who’ve never truly associated anything ‘real’ far cinema concerned. Wake Up Sid since gone become bit cult film; male lead going achieve superstardom strength genes, also terrific performances gotten better every passing film. Naturally, expectations Ayan Mukerji’s sophomore effort, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, bound pile up. I, one, corrected expectations first promo out. It seemed Mukerji decided forsake freshness realism Wake Up Sid favour bit more, I may say it, ‘masala’. That initial bit correction helped immensely, instinct film turned quite close film is. Stuck limbo realism (or much one spike ‘commercial’ film) usual larger-than-life-ness one usually associates Karan Johar (think Student Of The Year), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (YJHD) easy, fun-enough watch most, largely due continuously vibrant feel, highly competent lead supporting cast, music, straddles peppiness flavor ease. Episodic nature, YJHD introduces us Naina, young medical student state flux feels doesn’t get enough fun. A chance encounter old school friend makes Naina cross paths Kabir Thapar, Bunny, known friends. Despite poles apart, attraction ramifications lives, mention lives friends Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) Aditi (Kalki Koechlin). What surprised film much friendships relationships go beyond romance, romance (quite enchanting) lead pair. Quite like Wake Up Side flavor romance essentially coming-of-age film, film romance one pillars, one. It also story strong bonds friendship transcend time space, compromises one make order make relationship work, romantic otherwise. Not surprisingly, also, yet again, coming-of-age tale, something seems pet subject Ayan Mukerji. Expectedly, YJHD falters once. Every time film pauses moment genuine, real insight embellished cheesy-but-breezy dialogue (penned Hussain Dalal), see spark seen Wake Up Side. Soon after, though, film goes back farfetched situations would seemed home typical film helmed by, say, Karan Johar. This continuous oscillation insightful ‘filmy’ takes toll film one would liked. Another area film really worked treatment characters. Despite wearing chalk-and-cheese character sketches sleeves, Naina Bunny particular often act react completely character. So, overall trajectory always clear you, behaviour traits often make wonder exactly like that, actually supposed like that. Despite rather serious issues writing, then, really makes film race finish line performances. Starting Farookh Sheikh Tanvi Azmi barely couple scenes, way Ranbir Kapoor expectedly dominates proceedings terms screen time, every single actor worth weight gold, far particular film concerned. The surprise packages Kalki Koechlin, Aditya Roy Kapur Deepika Padukone, infuse genuine charm, likeability, believability credibility characters can’t help really love them. Ranbir’s performance needs considered context. After two diametrically opposite yet equally intense performances, one could fooled thinking Ranbir could easily ace character deserves challenging roles. Yes, YJHD doesn’t challenge like earlier films, doesn’t mean doesn’t invest it. Here someone gives every character everything has, Ranbir gives Bunny life deserves. Also, one can’t help notice terrific chemistry Ranbir – Deepika pair. They look like meant together screen, optimist believes potential become SRK – Kajol generation. Despite highly contrived song situations, music film, Pritam, holds own. Every song bit audio-visual treat; even one Madhuri Dixit it, despite terribly underwhelming situation arrives in. Overall, songs play major role keeping things going. Badtameez Dil Balam Pichkari terrific Ranbir Deepika respectively, Kabira Ilahi add soul texture soundtrack. With run time 2 hours 45 minutes fact film doesn’t really anything new say, film isn’t likely universally loved. Still, kind film wouldn’t attempt find much fault with, stays clear getting annoying overly predictable, even largely know direction led to. Not particularly bad way spend hours life, though I’d take Wake Up Sid YJHD day week, twice Friday.
