The split screen, black white poster Sudhish Kamath’s independent film Good Night Good Morning gives away much movie meets eye. Ofcourse, obvious ones go first – it’s film around two people, Turiya (Manu Narayan) Moira (Seema Rahmani). You given two perspectives, oscillation conflicting ideas romance conversation starts night ends morning. In gamut duality, lies film. It also tears you, viewer two. Should criticize film flaws amateurism? Or applaud Sudhish Kamath’s ability stressfully release independent film world demand shiny, bright rather expensive stars erase basic sense plot? Allow discuss sides coin. The film set New York New Year’s night. It hooked minute spent exactly 30 seconds panning Times Square. We immediately introduced tone film, nostalgic jazz background score walking introduction. It’s beautiful way begin film it’s visual romance later contested conversation makes film. Here Moira (Rahmani) seated bar, alone New Year’s Eve. She’s defensive wary stereotype coming way. She meets Turiya (Narayan) bunch inebriated friends bar, immediately cut hotel room she’s talking Turiya phone, who’s driving back Philadelphia friends. The first minutes conversation (on screen, narrative keeps jumping back forth) favorite. It awkward undertone parties try hardest make sound conversation offhand. You know, kind conversation would stranger, justify name boredom. Moira playful unabashed, whereas Turiya self-conscious trying hardest make impression. What follows dialogue-heavy intervention lives. Their notions ideas romance slowly unfold – beautifully pits two confusing boxes. Where lie? With Turiya – spite claiming romantic stuck love-less, obsessive rut past Moira – claims share heartbreaks still give idea romance? Most film shown split screen, easy camera presence Narayan Rahmani makes conversation pleasant, engaging one. The film attempts steer away monotony cutting flashbacks parodied hypothetical situations pair put make conversation. My personal favorite film’s spoof Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. It’s little skits (that color, serve pleasant alternative) explore two protagonists’ psyche. There moments film however, could easily done away with. For example, Turiya’s friends JC, Hussain random passed guy (Raja Sen, Vasanth Santosham) unnecessary. They try hard stand valid side characters (especially Raja Sen, who’s adorable parts constant cannabis-smile, gets bit tedious) It would much personal stimulating film conversation hotel room, driving car alone. The sub-plot friends brings film down, you’re deeply getting involved momentum conversation. The entire angle Moira’s past, constant nightmares also drag bit towards latter half film, told little Turiya’s past. It’s misbalance seen aspects give film amateur feel. The conversation ties Good Night Good Morning could done wit. It kind conversation starts crackle need outshine prove worthy dialogue. . Such conversation ability become like magnifying glass time – one makes plunge deep recesses medium another person. However, someone writes films, I imagine stress level I would I make film own. Primarily reason, Kamath’s film (he’s also film critic The Hindu) watched discussed. It’s least could viewer. Though isolation, Good Night Good Morning interesting film, extremely fascinating play type conversation people had.
