Daawat-e-ishq starts strongly theme dowry. It makes belch people ask dowry, case weren't already there. Which fine wonder going take here. You fly bizarre zone One lie begets another things mess considerably. Only end quick convenient solution, mention predictable. Yet earnestness performances issue film supports keep reasonably engaged. Parineeti Chopra, Aditya Roy Kapoor Anupam Kher completely comfortable skin characters. In fact, Parineeti Chopra (Gullu) seems repetitive considering Gullu runs parallel characters played Ladies vs Ricky Bahl Ishaqzaade. Anupam Kher amazes end, first seconds screen, I almost didn't realise him, given accent, mannerism dialogue delivery. Sure, slips every film progresses, first seconds stay you. Aditya Roy Kapoor makes believe rawness character, Tariq even though Tariq rather liberated compared backstory has. That charms Daawat-e-ishq. It unbelievable situations characters go back forth dilemmas depending situation presented with. Yet kind-of sort-of want behave way every juncture story. It rarity Hindi films, mixture wanting characters behave certain way irrespective unbelievable is. The rest then, songs, accent, Hyderabadi/Lucknowi flavor mere salt pepper added cover bland even silly meat film. In fact, last stretch film feels like even makers realised they've brought film twisted point smooth natural way unwind. It done hook crook that's pretty much happens. In way, convoluted mechanisms take away social issue film passionately wants support. You left wondering film fact saying situation dowry system country. You might dead sure horrific system, intertwined desperate measures dowry givers make shifts focus. A film issue heart might want place ifs buts around issue.
