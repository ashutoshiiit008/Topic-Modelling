I exactly fan qualified opinions - especially opinion movies. Either like don't - if, but, "mut" (opinion Hindi). In 5-star scale, Jodhaa Akbar certainly deserves 3, would translate "Wait DVD release" here. And waste would beautifully shot movie. However, spending half 200+ minutes mostly mundane romance half interesting yet dissatisfying display politics, I cannot tell must watch. Either catch theaters skip completely. Meanwhile, suggestions descriptive rating go second-last middle rating welcome! Jodhaa Akbar clearly divided two parts - political saga romance royal couple. It also obvious romance prime focus narrative. Hrithik Roshan (Emperor Akbar) chiseled fit handsomest mould picture-perfect, Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan (Queen Jodhaa) wonderful scenes together. You get dose Chemistry along History Geography. But, I would say largely due time given chemistry develop - curiosity become respect become love. And hit circular argument; time taken biggest culprit. The movie unjustifiably long. In often heavily clich√©d romantic scenes, law diminishing returns kept cropping mind. In movie general, every extra minute beyond 120-minute mark yields lesser enjoyment previous one. Unless, unless ... extremely captivating story tell, telling extremely captivating manner. I need something glittery jewelry costumes, bright reds, oranges, yellows, fantabulous sets keep fidgeting. Something natural, something less made-up. And get this, interval 120 minutes! The romance pretty dull. From bedroom tiffs mistaken identities - nothing new handled creative way. Especially appalling way mother misunderstandings takes shape - speech delivered monotonous fashion Ms. Rai-Bachchan. The sole scene might stand sword fight two. All-in-all romance lacked Bhuvan-Gauri's innocent charm Mohan Bhargav-Geeta's elegance. On hand, political drama, including dialogues, extremely interesting, - even though voiceover delivering lesson history. All credit history teacher, Amitabh Bachchan - listen voice softens talks Jodhaa. Some political situations executed really well too. The reactions various Rajputs Akbar's orders fine example. Another highlight political dramas language used. Both Urdu Hindi used beautifully, especially political sequences. At times dialogue repeated language. It sounded like enchanting jugalbandi languages. Unfortunately though, treated mere sub-plots give break mushy-mushy happenings main story. Most side characters underdeveloped thus one-dimensional. It seems like director simply fulfilling duty filling us political environment. To watch Akbar become crowd-pleaser one act kindness unconvincing. If one action supposed symbolic actions must taken, extremely dissatisfying. More instances Jodhaa light guides Akbar's soul would harmed. And course, lack time cannot excuse now, it? The war action scenes integral part entire drama. While battle sequences rather repetitive, first one exquisite camera work background score. Some fast camera movements awesome 3-D effect (okay, almost!). The silences add drama much drum rolls. The Rahman-Gowariker duo usually churns wonderful music. And nothing else spectacle. But, I felt let down. Only towards end "Khwaja" I realize song trying build Akbar's character. To show mesmerized go trance. Till then, I could empathize giggles around looking mannequins wearing clay-pot-look-alike hats attempting puppet dance. "Azeem-o-shaan" brilliant crowd aerial shots rather choreography use color. We've much better A. R. Rehman's musical sensibilities Javed Akhtar's pen imagination. Mr. Gowariker, leaving melodrama, "almighty solving problems without input humans" syndrome Barjatyas? How letting Ekta Kapoor reign "salt-pepper" kitchen politics? So, block systems name. Surely must saas-bahu equation that! Cannot thank enough sparing us triple action repeat cuts, though. A thousand salutations N D Studios, magnificent sets! But leaving Bhansalis world? What's point can't focus best - narrate story, reach us?
