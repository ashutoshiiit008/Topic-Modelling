I love action films I love idea machines transforming machines. Seriously, it's damn neat. It's idea also slick way they've transforming since Transformers (the first series). I like machines move sounds make it. As sarcastic may sound (given rating), I mean it. But same? For two half hours? Naah. Don't make hate something I love, overdoing it. Actually, I already enough Transformers: Revenge Fallen . The monotony action sequence climax made nod good twenty minutes. I'm proud it, especially since I accompanying Transformer-enthusiast. Oh no, I didn't sleep one, I going review it, I couldn't sleep. So, that's credit film. For non-action minutes film, might 20, good comic lines lot mumbo-jumbo freedom. There good aliens vs. evil aliens. And cross double-cross humans. Which also means, humans don't get much room emote. They scared tense most, continue way rest film. I understand and, maybe, even come terms fact action films - course - cannot bothered story. And Transformers: Dark Moon I wasn't expecting one either. But least could done get creative action 3D. Some ways one car turns mean machine back, looks like mere cut-and-paste either earlier scene another car, color-corrected. More action, I don't mind. More - I trouble spending time, energy money on.
