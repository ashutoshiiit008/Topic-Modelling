It's interesting despite run-of-the-mill two-brothers-differ-in-attitude storyline, Kisaan manages spring couple surprises. Despite masala elements, manages bring couple tragedies. A family torn apart distance village city. Physical, emotional, financial, etc. Education within agricultural background. But, silly jokes stereotyping city-citizens' arrogance villagers' ignorance get tiring. One brother's naïveté brother's love violence gets bit convenient aid wrapping film. Letting misunderstandings brew, blind manipulation one's forte. And enemy like snapping anyone offends them. And yet interesting turns. But again, climax extremely handy. Very simplistic. Ultra-hurried. None characters complex enough require great performance anyone. So, Jackie Shroff Khan brothers Dia Mirza run mechanics. Whether capable not, another question together. And yet amongst three men lead roles, Dia Mirza's character Priya role minimal substance. But everything main plot seems superficial cursory. I cannot leave place without mentioning annoying background music was. People, it's Punjab don't need hundred extra dholak-wallas orchestra! It's debate. Whether applaud unpredictability they've attempted partially succeeded at. Or hate predictability clichés. Had done something spectacular unexpected turn events, might worth try. And since that's missing, isn't anything I ask look forward to.
