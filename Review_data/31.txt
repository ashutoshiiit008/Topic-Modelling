Except first times Neil Nitin Mukesh emotes fear, 3G nothing going it. The minimal good effects erased off, character made later film. From basis scary supernatural ludicrous technical metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, everything 3G first makes slap palm forehead, irritates finally bores repetitions. There might couple occasions might look forward something novel, dies almost immediately. Just think pace couldn't get slower, thrown song pretty much rhyme reason gratuitous skin show. If film managed hook bit, question would haunt, "Why aren't leaving Fiji? The exotic location songs done already?" You get drift, let's keep short. There must better themes horror lovers make horror, no?
