Talaash springs surprise. Not thriller sort-of way. But characters overall story. You don't really expect film mysterious accident much deeply damaged protagonists one trying bring peace soul within. Given that, still come feeling didn't know characters well enough. Talaash leans heavily typical assumptions going make characters given situations. A stern police officer lost dear one behave particular manner. A mourning young mother forlorn. It gives much first minutes adds more. And lot goes story characters weave together known promos itself. Yet again, promos, overall marketing general, film takes expectations different direction, direction detrimental film. It sort-of cheating calling Talaash thriller even psychological thriller. For want better phrase let coin 'emotional thriller' seems fit bill better. Had trailers synopsis hinted towards heavy emotional bent film, I wouldn't spent first half looking thrill. And again, I realise little weight pre-release material film deserves. Lesson learnt. Anyways, I figured Talaash isn't really going bring thrill hurry, I settled pace film. Slowly, pace grows even though story unfolds never ever really grips core. This mainly due many threads opened first half. Is accident/murder? Is police officer's personal trauma? Is wife's mental health? Is prostitutes palpable conditions? Is enigmatic prostitute? Well, ends them, pieces don't come together seamlessly. Also, constantly felt like wanted keep things subtle got scared spelling things out, case audience doesn't 'get it'. I understand, thriller needs send audience many directions keep distracted what's really happening. But, weightage threads gets first half, injustice them. None sub-plots take deeper characters situations. They stay superficial level. What actually keeps going performances. For change, Aamir Khan Surjan Shekhawat Aamir Khan. The times I reminded star addressed superior looked younger 'Sir'. It felt off. To director, Reema Kagti's credit, film overwhelmed presence. Or Kareena Kapoor's. She plays teasing prostitute mysterious aura elegance. Rani Mukerji short powerful presence. On hand, Raj Kumar Yadav Nawazuddin Siddiqui entertain create intrigue respectively. I still would prefer seeing films characters. And far twist tale goes, make fair guess promos, guess confirmed 20 minutes second half. But pretty cool still little away whole truth. What I found amusing non-Indian film, 'whole truth' would apparent lot earlier. Now I relent temptation naming one particular psychological thriller Hollywood give movie away, let move away twist. Yet, won over. I always enjoyed stories climax gives film meaning seemed about. In clarification, many films lose plot last half hour take away everything build till then. Whereas Talaash takes entire goose chase deeper level. A level I hadn't seen coming mainly I didn't think I'd see Hindi film. I'm used disconnected dots staying films generate. Unfortunately, chase rendered pretty much pointless, apparent chase all. Talaash game hide-and-seek characters play themselves. It emotional tale police officer, responsible father's need catharsis, closure deserves. Which why, seems like film could meant much more. That could connected much deeply funky climax, uses voice-overs scenes saw earlier spoon-feed us. Also, doesn't film talking philosophical, psychological emotional stuff need much profound powerful dialogue? All one dialogue obviously metaphorical. So, despite performances make stars look like humans, despite awesome production design camera-work, despite potential play tricks mind audience would enjoy figuring out, despite obvious, Talaash remains good film.
