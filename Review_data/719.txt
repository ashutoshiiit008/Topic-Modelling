Perhaps biggest disappointment Playing For Keeps fact comes Gabriele Muccino, director little gem film, The Pursuit Happyness. The former isn’t patch latter, spite fact two films seemingly emotional core – coming-of-age father-son story. George Dryer erstwhile football star, hard days. He’s moved Virginia closer little son, lives mother; Dryer divorced. Aspiring sports anchor, spends time making audition tapes himself, selling old football memorabilia raise cash. He eventually takes position coach school football team, son plays. Amidst attractive, needy soccer moms vying attention, Dryer sets trying ‘grow up’. The film struggles establish trying be. Is supposed purely emotional story? If so, many subplots attempts comedy make even minor dent viewer’s heart. Is supposed comedy? If case, film isn’t funny, even though tries hard be. The film tilt towards emotional touching, attempts draw viewer journey Dryer character undertakes. But falls flat count. Apart fact film written poorly - graph narrative treatment – I suspect also largely cast film, precise, manner used. It’s strange popular acclaimed actors like Dennis Quaid, Uma Thurman, Catherine Zeta-Jones likes signed thankless, pointless side characters. The characters aren’t strong enough make audience feel companions obstacles Dryer’s personal journey, yet given enough screen time test audience’s patience. So much 106-minute film seems far longer actually is. Gerard Butler George Dryer admittedly appealing enough; tousled locks charming Scottish accent least justify many women go weak knees around him. But even character poorly written rest, behaviour company women flinging completely place. Jessica Biel wife churns best performance film, even though I must say didn’t particularly tough role play. At various points runtime, film seems like wasted opportunity anything else. It nothing offer audience, save good-looking cast. It lacks soul; nothing make audience identify characters even something genuinely laugh at. Hard recommend even DVD TV watch, Playing For Keeps bland, silly film doesn’t make point.
