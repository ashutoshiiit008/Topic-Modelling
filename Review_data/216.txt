I tell love Conan The Barbarian - Bulky, gym-going, Hayabusa driving, testosterone sweating, alpha males whose worst fear called Gay. They’re afraid cry, wear pink, anything spells b-l-o-o-d involves manly barking, FUN! And keeping cliché, Conan The Barbarian blood, sweat low-baritone action. Not mention, mindless, plotless painful. Michael Nispel’s Conan Barbarian, brought attention Arnold Schwarzenegger 1982 version film, follows pretty much plot (?). Conan (Jason Momoa) born amidst war, grows brutal, fearsome warrior. He stands among peers mastery swords. When returns village, finds hostage powerful warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang). The film tracks Conan fights dignity village – rather barbarically. When film opens gruesome scene, moment think could thrilling film – coupled story reason us take journey fights, blood tears. However, dear friend Conan seems jump one fight another without joining dots. The entire “story” told us hurried first 10 mins, following it’s “Dishum!” – 20 dead, dance swords rivers blood. Sadly, there’s nothing epic legendary it. Jason Momoa cannot taken seriously. Although credit could given costume/make-up, certainly looks part – someone needs sit explain screaming guts doesn’t make barbarian (most fights graphically enhanced anyway. No points acting, all) I friends read Marvel comics Conan Barbarian tell comics much detailed, enchanting grand. They give sense journey, real fight. Schwarzenegger’s version film made international star, 1982 film convincing screen savagery, set benchmark raw, rugged action. Conan The Barbarian 3D however, repetitive boring. It’s sequences rotated washing machine film. A set bloody, gory war scenes sinister, half-smirking villains love evilness makes frustrating 2 hours. It seems like makers learnt nothing predecessors. The 1982 version grand background score, earning immense popularity, given Basil Poledouris. This Conan The Barbarian – screams. Please save film. And wallet-tearing trend 3D basically another head-ache inducing mechanism. You’d much better watching soap-opera re-run TV.
