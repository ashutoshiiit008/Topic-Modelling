Yeh Saali Zindagi crime comedy hooks like thriller tickles throughout, exactly like good comedy would. Kidnappers goof-up, victims crime offer help end messier situations. These kinds situations Yeh Saali Zindagi built upon. The basic plot whacky - like individual tracks characters. Just get used one sub-plot new twist waiting turn, yet doesn't feel rushed. Magically, events previous scene registered. Surprisingly, point information overload, could issue films go back forth. Your comfort proceedings could well non-linearity terms flashbacks context too. For example, character goes happy memories past relieve physical pain on. I thoroughly enjoyed wit writing. It's clever dialogue - overall story, build-up, sequence sub-plots come also inbuilt humor. I might enjoyed better I knew characters, terms backstory, anything made feel - it'd nice connect emotion character. But again, it's required I feel anyone film falls bracket - dark comedy. I enjoyed idiosyncrasies are. A lot course, credited Irrfan Khan. The man perfect sense timing kind humor needs. Chitrangda Singh one reasons want watch film. There host characters interesting actors playing out, none Arunoday Singh enough screen time. Arunoday Singh though seemed uncomfortable misfit gang goons. And irritants like voiceovers animated airplanes. I don't enjoy voiceovers general, ones educate 'life' really profound maintain interest. Also, become integral part Hindi films genre tone used manner delivered. Another downer choppy edits, kind I found disorienting director, Sudhir Mishra's earlier film Khoya Khoya Chand. And I could lived with, without complaining, smart content. But lame unnecessary superimposed text showed director/writer seemed lost respect audience post-production. Also silly animation rhyme rhythm. The intention must make comic, animation didn't fit rest humor film. There decisions made film richer experience. The camerawork made trippy experience. Though I don't understand many shots (day shots too) almost completely dark. Did take genre literally? But since many scenes actors barely seen, feels like lighting decisions made hide lack skill. What counts though film enjoyable despite dark ambience. What remarkable performances aren't breathtaking, characters don't connect general feeling watched good film stays you.
