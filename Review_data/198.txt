The plot twists Checkmate indeed make grey cells twist turn would game chess. Unfortunately, events develop pace unplugs instead getting hooked. Also, since non-linear narration particular point view, twists seem random place. This makes non-linearity rather haphazard. The base story takes time formulate settle down. On way develops main characters' frustration situation. However, different traits characters given full vent. And thus, initial character development seems vain. Unfortunately, yet again, way woman achieve anything using sexuality, however intelligent is. The actors playing characters also give earth-shattering performances, neither one make pull hair apart. Each one his/her bit. The voiceover narrative style used throughout movie gives feel watching choppy chain events rather story flowing one plot another. However, nice touch voiceovers pass judgments characters also, rather narrating story. My basic problem pace movie. A thriller move. It cannot pause take breather; cannot stop seashores because. A pause something, pregnant, something via background music camerawork. But pauses exist director thinks building suspense. Nope...tedium surely building. Had shorter 15 minutes, could well worth watch. But people crossing double-crossing double-double-crossing till lose track pretty annoying time end credits roll.
