One first lines Ghost go, "I'm doctor. I behave responsibly, right?" And along typical texture goes B-grade horror film, seal deal far good film going be. And case gives little chance re-opened. The little chance afforded way spooks created first couple times. Slimy insects hardcore gore begin rudely interrupted special effects make images look like shot thermographic camera sort. I'm game filmmakers experimenting techniques, unfortunately looked like cop-out - method could avoid showing implied gore. Or use technology feasible refined prosthetics skills would needed pull off. That could've made film better terms number genuine creeps provided. Unfortunately, creeps come cheesy dialogues romantic situations like, "Why beautiful, Suhani?" "I'll forget till I forget myself." Incidentally, supposed break 'intense' horror situations thus love affair rhythmically interspersed core Ghost story. Usually genre leave enough opportunities actors scream, squeal thus show acting prowess. But Ghost's story doesn't room lead pair barely every faces spirit that's causing terror. Our man Shiney Ahuja one break-down that's it. Sayali Bhagat sequences give moderately scared expression quite firmly holds one scenes - including romance. Shiney Ahuja here.> Speaking jokes, usually horror movies associated two kinds laughter audience. One kind film trying scare nervous laughter comes right stand-alone spine-chilling scene. Ghost gives neither. It tries bit Christian symbolism character named Mary frogs locust-like insects, pace slow many non-horror sequences I could hardly bothered make sense them. The silver lining entire gamut things go wrong Ghost directed woman. I don't think many women directed horror films. For it's worth needs applauded. And yet, I cannot recommend watch even nothing better do.
