There much searing, blistering persona India's biggest superstar do, film surrounding ordinarily written, poorly directed shoddily produced mess. The fact Lingaa, directed K. S. Ravikumar (director one Thalaiva's biggest hits, Padayappa,) unworthy phenomenon Superstar Rajnikanth surprise, films are. The disappointment lies fact fails enhance add legend great man - something every 'commercial' film built around must strive do. It can't hard, really. The presence Thalaiva means fans lap absolutely everything unconditional joy. Why risk something push envelope unheard places - kind take Indian cinema next level? Shankar - Indian director least comes close possessing vision match Rajni aura - extent Sivaji - The Boss Endhiran. Even Soundarya's Kochadaiyyan film least tried something unheard Indian cinema. In wake films, Lingaa unmitigated disaster, seen purely cinematic terms. The strange thing one can't accuse film story, one, one potential. A thieving hoodlum sidekicks come village depends dam livelihood - dam tied intricately aspect man's past. There's plot angle shares Kochadaiyyan well, though I don't want reveal here. Not revolutionary, story definitely potential - especially since gives film lot openings talk issues plaguing India past continue even today. Thalaiva gets play saviour yet again, that's always fun watch. The problem lies juvenile screenplay truly atrocious VFX - kind intern mid-level animation house would able achieve amount hard work. The film many in-jokes, many references hat-tips Thalaiva legacy, becomes hard take seriously point. Superstar characters plays cinema. To film tries clever references means you're always breaking illusion audience. They may clap-traps, destroy film long run. Another disappointment regressive sidetracks involving women. One would love see Rajnikanth film women something apart objects curiosity, I'm sure Thalaiva would gladly acquiesce part film. Even hardcore male chauvinistic Thalaiva fans wouldn't mind seeing film. The problem filmmakers make living mooching Thalaiva aura clearly don't seem think women matter larger scheme things. Sonakshi Sinha, plays one two female leads film, plays ditzy girl plays every film she's part of, save Lootera. I'm surprised hasn't exploded yet weight sheer same-ness existence. Is redeeming factor film? Of course - Superstar Rajnikanth himself. His screen presence blinding, conviction emotes inspiring, pure magic explanation unlikeliest man becoming India's biggest screen god full display. There's one like Superstar Rajnikanth simply nobody like Superstar Rajnikanth. Everything else, including K. S. Ravikumar's slipshod film, pales away.
