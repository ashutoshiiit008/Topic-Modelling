The real story Pompeii tragic one. A thriving city Roman empire, progressive time, gutted eruption Mt. Vesuvius, constantly rumbling volcano non-destructive centuries till then. Director Paul W. S. Anderson, unlike namesake (the one enviable filmographies!) best known camp; think Mortal Kombat Death Race. In hands, Pompeii, film, becomes VFX-heavy actioner love story well bromance thrown in. The film isn't particularly unwatchable, one films sorely miss familiar faces lead roles; kind film needed raw star power justify scale mounted on. The story, undoubtedly, weight. A budding period romance obstacles own, town base volcano that, unknown them, verge cataclysmic eruption. If told sensitive, auteristic vision, film potential go epic love story. Instead, get predictable gladiator-style fight scenes, English British American accents Roman city, half-baked romance hardly ever feel connect lead pair - simply hardly ever see together. In fact, lead character Milo's romance gets lesser footage story growing friendship fellow slave named Atticus. Such contrast two stories, dying moments film, root two men end alive together, irrespective whether Milo unites lady love not. All could still made genuine big screen fun, film charismatic cast, or, least, big star essaying role Milo. Kit Harrington, plays mysterious, strong silent Milo, doesn't magnetic persona needed make character you'd want cheer for. The familiar faces cast - Kiefer Sutherland, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jared Harris - seem almost embarrassed there. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Atticus endearing stiffness. Despite obvious acting skills, root Milo. To fair, film decent VFX. The long shots Pompeii, imposing Vesuvius backdrop, look quite impressive, period feel, even historical authenticity quite suspect. But action set pieces aren't particularly imaginative, 3D glasses darken film tad much. Mercifully, film brisk short, testing patience much. Despite mounted scale is, Pompeii gives generic, been-there-seen-that feel it, isn't aided way anchoring presence carry film through. It's kind film hard take seriously, even though seems like people who've given all. It wasn't final shot film, touching symbol eternal love, struck lot wasted potential real well reel story Pompeii.
