What kind juvenile writing this? Boy meets girl engaged her. They don't want get married other. They play games families go marriage. And then, guess what? They want get married! And I'm giving movie away. There's story. How I wish "to" story too. It's one cases even characters' motivations explained, can't made care, everything outrageous. I mean, take film scene seriously - ominous music girl tells ex didn't call stressful event life deleted number mobile! And accompanying dialogue atrocious too. The performances passable. The makeup awful. The camerawork basic purely functional. The music .. whatever... Oh well, entire film less regressive "whatever" feel it. Who films made for? Do films takers? Really?
