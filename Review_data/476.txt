Jayantabhai Ki Love Story showed little potential it's trailers. So, despite needs wanting watch every film neutrality, I went expecting little, all. The best I say, I came unscathed almost zero expectations. The 'bhaigiri' end Jayantabhai Ki Love Story unethusiastic love story end stagnant. The film pretty much flat throughout, except little ruffle feathers name climax. So, plain love story, even Jayanta (Vivek Oberoi) Simran (Neha Sharma) take 'big step' couple, go back old relationship soon enough. Tiffs vanish becomes well, soon. Similarly, underworld track film gathers momentum all. The conflict start doesn't see much change. Both patronage animosity superficial. You never figure one loyal another another person's throat. It said so, thus believed. And two tracks little other. Whatever little intersection exists, lame enough ignored. The rest filled slime-balls corporate world seemed worse infamous casting couches formulaic songs shot exotic locations gratuitous show cleavage inanity. Amidst limp stories then, smart-Aleckry dialogue brings laugh two. You also scoff Munnabhai references. Also, everything else devoid energy, over-eager performances make applaud attempt putting life characters. It amazing then, producers willingly go projects. What Jayantabhai Ki Love Story wasn't told already frame something wasn't told better way elsewhere? You wonder, wonder.
