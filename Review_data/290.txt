EMI certainly touches upon relevant issue society today. And though showcases concerns cities, pertinent interiors country too. It also hilarious regular intervals. Especially Mohan Joshi's drunken scene. And Sanjay Dutt know best - deliver dialogues Mumbai-underworld fashion time lines perfectly. The actors barely bearable - Malaika Arora's existence taking first place. So, general idea details right. But individual stories chosen, started interestingly, became sappy taste. And actors barely bearable. The set-up stories, reasons various characters take loans unable repay quite interesting. A different aspect touched upon story. The plan recovery process cute too, actual act childish. And final resolutions tacky hurried set-up seems like complete waste. Also, came across writers confused purpose story â€“ narrate four people went process taking, defaulting repaying loans, showcase transition person mafia? In trying deal 5 plots much taken plate also lengthened movie bit much. Cinema source education taken way seriously yet subject presented over-simplistically. And put together actually undo actually entertaining bits pieces.
