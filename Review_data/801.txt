There's archaic law, needs changed fair today's times. The politicians businessmen taking advantage law common man getting raw end deal. The common man protests. The politicians businessmen try thwart protest using rulebook convenience. Sound familiar? And thought one law country needs fixed. In instance, talking anti-corruption bill, fact Sahi Dhande Galat Bande talking laws related Land Acquisition public use. Unfortunately, keeps interesting much. And falls flat face simplistic solution. Sahi Dhande Galat Bande mix themes styles. It's things can't mixed well general, it's here, didn't blend flow well together. This film makes huge spaces lush green farms look rugged. Later gun-fight slow motion whitewashed/bleached shots. Both stylizations work space put together film, don't look like one product. Sahi Dhande Galat Bande also tries make point. But, point ages old isn't new way film makes it. Fortunately, though dilemmas main character made go half-promising. And looking forward going resolve it. It's different matter let down. But, getting fun interesting. The performances good character. If only, writers dwelled little characters lead brought little color personalities. Because looked like interesting facets, privy them. Maybe reason Sahi Dhande Galat Bande got interested relevance topic given week's events country. I wonder would come release date wasn't coincidentally close Anna's protest corruption. Surely, I doubt potential ruffle many feathers even now, marketing budget constraints lackluster way it's done. But might well debut film director.
