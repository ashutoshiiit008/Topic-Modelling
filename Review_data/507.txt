Metro city dwellers rarely, ever, face severe power crises, probably take access electricity granted. But large portion India outside biggest cities, daily prolonged power cuts deficits generation supply, still sad reality. Katiyabaaz, documentary pitiful state affairs regard electricity Kanpur, quite eye opener. Not succinctly memorably highlight key aspects subject deals with, also pretty much reminder wrong India today. Narrated following two diverse points view - one katiyabaaz (a term someone provides illegal electricity connections), bureaucrat headed Kanpur Electricity Supply Company Ltd KESCO - film takes us gamut problems citizens face, lengths go attempt fix it. The former, Loha Singh, one could consider target audience Salman bhai's Eid releases. He flashy, funny, garrulous, belligerent rather disproportionate sense self worth. And yes, manages come outrageous one-liners. But one would notice one observes carefully, willingness tread moral lines. You see, man knows he's something illegal, feels right so, screwed system, villain. Symbolising villain Ritu Maheshwari, assumes KESCO's reigns one worst periods. She honest, intelligent seems genuinely want change system. One really feels her, tries best set things straight, crack power theft electricity distributed better, attempt connect consumers better use technology. Yet, much bureaucrat populace stubborn political leadership ineffective providing better infrastructure. The film rather beautifully captures flavour Kanpur, enchanting place Uttar Pradesh, never mind sorry plight law order state. It gut-wrenching think city known Manchester East former glory days centre industry, reduced shambles place suffers daily power cuts long 15 hours. (Oh, former name, Cawnpore, old world charm it!) The film treads shaky ground, however, consider treated. Situations would surreptitious part daily life Kanpur take place front camera, hence end looking staged. Loha Singh particular, hoot interviews, seems playing gallery talking directly camera. He seems conscious fact shot cinema idol - perform audience - seems relish idea. These portions film - ones appear fake (for want better word) - film's intentions come question, even though carefully avoids taking actual sides. Still, film unfolds pace style thriller, ends high raises questions one would really like delve deeper into. If takes popularize documentary format India, it. But Katiyabaaz film every Indian identify learn from, truly want to.
