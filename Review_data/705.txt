An open mind helps. I laughed loud times first half - playing along, humoring makers, taking silliness face value, generally taking chill pill. Really, otherwise I wouldn't "liked" movie even much. But, jokes took sudden dip second half last half hour literally wore out. I make peace labeled stuck-up. I donâ€™t care much David Dhawan style escapism I certainly don't think missing much Govinda away pulling faces parliament. So, obviously, transitivity I certainly big David Dhawan-Govinda combination. (Ok, need get geeky bring nitty-gritty theory.) The point fall categories, wrong place. Having offended 64% Hindi cinema-goers, I must reassure rest I way trying infuse intellect David Dhawan presentation. Lest intellect questioned. Still searching heart soul desperately - looking something jokes like movie. Unfortunately, I also Salman Khan, biceps (or jokes showing off), intentional melodramatic dialogue delivery. Oh well...might well go ahead say Katrina Kaif looks like plastic doll heavy make-up on. The good thing director smart enough give many lines. Oops! I lost another 34 (31 + 3)% Hindi cinema goers. Lara Dutta hand, looking prettier day. And somehow also improved acting. When ideas copied movies, obviously making frame-by-frame copy adds creative value. But, see additions made Andy Tennant's Hitch Partner begin rethink unwarranted utterly ridiculous demands creativity. When songs first 20 odd minutes, I thought I dozed point missed whole load fun. Though I must say making extra background score loudly delivered lines. And calamities come come battalions. I shown song song music could tap feet missing extra something makes song memorable. And well, lyrics lack soul. But, good thing Salman Govinda never disappoint dancers. Though I could survived even without pelvises thrust here, everywhere (sitting second row screen help!). But, can't really complain, I? It David Dhawan movie, all. I must admit regular slapstick people chasing people throwing stuff other. There regular slapstick (Govinda pants down, et al) + missile chasing Salman scuba suit (Oh come girls, wipe drool!!) + choTa Don Don theme music background + etc. Sounds like fun you? Go it!
