"Common man angst" I don't think topic getting old India time soon. Especially, new ideas, much ever impractical might be. And new, easily palatable solutions, even easily invoke activism exactly Ungli offers. The impressive thing writing picks topics I encounter day-to-day basis provide style solution. It goes little beyond. It creates intriguing character gives character dilemma - real dilemma see fighting within. That doesn't take away fact "ungli activism" episodes pretty well thought out. I especially enjoyed rickshaw episode. No, closer heart. Maybe little picked issue involved civic sense. Maybe little usual suspects - politicians/law enforcement. Even little dared point finger not-so-rich class. But, point story done. And how, facts - target typical ones rich creates unforeseen complications. Also triggers change dynamics relationships characters. Such slight detail writing rare Hindi films, especially mainstream films I take delight them. It comes icing cake, performances mostly restrained there's melodrama. Of course, whole "angst" bit come across dramatic points. But again, I see getting worked much, I see car halting middle road drop someone off. Here, issues larger reasons too. Randeep Hooda, Emraan Hashmi, Angad Bedi Neil Bhopalam play bits well actually look like real people real world. Maybe self-referencing line Emraan Hashmi could've avoided reminds actor rather keep character. On hand, I liked fact Neha Dhupia Kangna Ranaut came industry banking heavily used heavily oomph-factor, slowly taking non-glam avatars. Just neither wore anything blingy good enough too. I guess much ask makers avoid item number. Shraddha Kapoor trying make point appearance bar dancer. An item number doesn't even lip-sync one line properly man song honors. These things beginning film make little wary what's come. But movie proceeds, annoying bits kept bay settle in. And actually get involved. An engaging film Ungli is. But like observed another film long ago, "Human behavior life doesn't change 3 hours."
