All I'd liked say Tevar typical action masala film. It's make it. If like kind action story ancillary matter convenience core film, enjoy one. If not, won't. It fact simple that. Given film's title, default, every character film carries attitude them, including villain's sidekick. Except, except lead lady. She one needs constant protection taking care of. The tiny bit attitude allowed carry one-tenth second instantaneously over-powered someone else's attitude. The one-liner boy meets girl story extension - boy meets girl running away crazy powerful thus dangerous admirer. You would think extension adds right amount salt pepper give decent film. But, set-up kind masala. The one random fist sword fights; long longer chases songs complete circle. Though conceptually, romance seems central plot, reality feels like fallback option, "if don't fall love other, do? What do?" Fortunately, actors take jobs seriously. Arjun Kapoor says dialogue way much style taste, title film demands. I like avatar Sonakshi Sinha better boisterous, loud-mouthed version genre films. What would really nice though, break something completely different. We wait film. Manoj Bajpai, expected, complete element eccentric, egomaniac, obsessed lover. Unfortunately, well character written. It commitment character. But, blatant. It considered positive - film aware trying hard tell story much wants show action pretty much purpose. It doesn't quite work though. Which why, Tevar one those. Those want like it, enjoy come may. Others fret fume like.
