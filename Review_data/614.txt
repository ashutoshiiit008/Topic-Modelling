Just case title movie doesn't arouse skepticism quality humor movie, promos must have. No? Then rest assured opening sequence put eternal optimism rest. What bikini clad woman walking shore beach. And Om Puri monkeying around black red magician suit-meets-superhero costume final signature. Believe me, cannot imagine hurts use Om Puri monkeying together sentence. I must admit basic concept letting elderly life caring sweet. But, somehow crassness done, gel me. A son (Akshaye Khanna) yelling father (Paresh Rawal), name comedy work twice, throughout? Not happening. Also, father dreaming son finding love natural. Call conservative, imagining possible daughter-in-law (Genelia D'Souza) getting wet waterfall getting suggestive son cool. Add shirtless Om Puri shrieked shrill Archana Puran Singh. How expected laugh this? So yeah, Paresh Rawal, like always, tries bring life trying-so-hard-to-make-you-laugh lines comic timing. This time better worse others. Akshaye Khanna screaming intolerably top voice half time, like 75 minutes. And thinks dialogue delivery going bad worse movie? He actually extra pauses none warranted couple places. Genelia looks pretty plays casual character alright. Whether she's acting way real life, we'll know 3-4 movies old. The lyrics music songs generic could be. Also choreographer lead pair finish gym/aerobic workout set. And use bikini-clad women particular reason never blatant. So, cutting songs could helped movie. Same goes another 15-20 minutes movie. There unnecessary pauses long dialogues nothing elongate runtime. What point entire crew go Kerala neither script need Kerala, manage capture intrinsic beauty. I still think humor nice way portray father-son relationship. But, I don't understand loud, long lousy.
