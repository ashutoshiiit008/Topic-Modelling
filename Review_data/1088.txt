Take away Sushmita rating falls last slot…that’s much movie Sushmita much-publicized rock star character, Kria. Sushmita’s acting evokes emotion - audience smiles happy tears swell sad. It sometimes feels like seeing slice real life. She looks gorgeous - breathtaking-gorgeous, wow-she-is-so-sweet-gorgeous. She designed outfits dazzling. A Sushmita fan might want miss one. For rest, though, nothing much there. Yes, Shiney Ahuja plays doctor well, since story rock star, much. He really insightful lines, especially narrator mode. The character artistes loud exaggerated. Most unnatural characters. Moushmi Chatterjee needs something diction. One best things movie comes towards end. It symbolism poem Kria writing situation faces, played artistically. The screenplay stretched out. There many scenes, audience enough time think say, “Okay, got point, next please!” The story different good, end prolonged realize climax going hour movie finishes. The suspense therefore effectively ruined! Then, sit waiting happen. Of course, opportunity lost put song. And not? They perfect excuse! The atypical music easily overshadowed lyrics. To eye though songs much treat. The song introduces Sushmita starts performing stage becomes like video album giving artificial look. Was somebody trying save money crowded, rock-show scene right song? And what’s supposedly sensuous songs amongst unusually long white curtains? Not technical nuances handled well. While medical information given sounds close reality. But then, person dying, isn’t doctor’s first reaction take him/her hospital?!? There flaws rock star side too. Like, rock star break song wherever pleases, isn’t bound contracts?
