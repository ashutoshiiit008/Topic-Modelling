The whiff Arabian Sea. You smell it. The first drops rain sweating forehead. You sense them. The love Mumbaikar express city. You feel it. I'm getting romantic you. You dread it. But I I see two people comfortable screen - characters actors. Not necessarily romantically "more friends" sort-of way. But romantically two individuals react interact. So, got that? The number times "romantic" derivatives repeated far indicate you, young lads, already planning dinner date perfect date movie. And chicks, go watch flick. The older generation hand could empathize parents film. Sid normal, college-going kid - neither superstar college, super-buffoon. Neither teenage heartthrob class dunce. He's carefree proud it. Aisha serious knows wants. Her practicality exaggeration, understated - regular, motivated girl. Their contrasts - evident. Their similarities - deciphered. The first sequence film tells film going take time develop unfold. And last sequence know isn't much unfolding done (except t-shirts kurtis). The story half-a-line yet I'm going feel hurt behalf makers audience complained, "there story!" At times movie goes deeper, doesn't need many words describe story. And time I spent Sid (Ranbir Kapoor) Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), I wanted know them. It felt better see screen time spent niceties relationship. It good see grow closer fonder other. Aaawww…that's friendships like. And I deprived more. And I hurt one oblivious other's emotions satisfy hunger drama. Whether it’s maker's hunger audience's - I know. But annoyed I was, see twosome got drawing room, throw out-of-character, ignorant behavior. Those two, candid, lucid supposed best friends minutes ago. Then couple side characters throw punch. Anything Karan Johar angle parental love associated dramatic moments. Whether belong. And belong here. Especially realize one caricatured one punch line. The lines fine later too. Smartly used thinking sensitive characters. And suddenly it's spoilt one on-the-face line. While individual characters didn't work, interconnected relationships well-developed scene two. But whatever bit dialogue-writer lacked, made way two protagonists created. Of course, kudos two actors, one maturing, one looks like born fully-developed acting skills. The maturing Ranbir Kapoor will, I guess, industry's first candidate puppy-look, innocent boy. And yet boy-next door. I enjoyed bits performances up-close I saw expressions. Similarly whole list things add value due absence. And top list conscious decision pause, moment awkwardness boy girl hug, touch. Its handled delicately finesse. We getting used superficial attitude making film woman protagonist, end seeing man claim glory. This one equally Ranbir's Konkona's. Yes, even though title film contains protagonist's name. For long-long time I've watching Hindi romantic film story lead pair. That's it. Their emotions, turmoil nothing else. Love Aaj Kal close Wake Up Sid comes even closer. I guess background noise inevitable satisfy need-more-masala palettes. But, growing audience it's heartening see masala-chef production houses walk hand-in-hand us.
