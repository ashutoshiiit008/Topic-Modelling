There two story-lines. One involving politician, henchmen agenda. The one henchmen love wife. Thankfully, connection two plots common character. But, somehow, disconnect. It screenplay forgetting one plot long duration on, thus making obviously feel like two different stories. Yet, curiosity weird, almost surreal events keep engaged. The problem direction though ambience tilts toward much surrealism kind-of figure what's going on. Even exactly what's going happen, know general direction waiting watch hunch come right. Fortunately, bit different outright predictability, usually ensues boredom. This not. There also attempt stick traditional tactics attached thriller genre. The music stylish use light camera angle. Unfortunately, it's good attempt. The punch heard seen. Though I cannot put finger exactly is, something amiss far style concerned making look "wannabe". Then caricatured characters. The henchmen well-defined weird trait. Like guy hasn't outgrown nursery rhyme days likes reciting kill. This, I think saw The Usual Suspects. Except doesn't add menace character, makes funny. Which means lot lacking acting department. Each actor looks like he/she trying hard, including mystic character played Sonali Kulkarni. And attempt caricatured character defined becomes extremely distracting. And yet, twist tale decent one. Even real good one, don't see coming. Meanwhile, theater trip saved another thriller, another Friday. This one alright TV too.
