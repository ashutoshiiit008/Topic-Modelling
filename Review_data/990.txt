An exciting start introduces gamut cartoon characters largely represent real-life stereotypes potential entertain. Unfortunately, length film restricted attention span target audience, clearly 10. Hence, justice done characters. So, left mish-mash characters stay together story. A story father wanting hero kids, fighting cartoons help cartoons. I'm sure kids ten enjoy film, gimmickry, slapstick included. But, I don't really like idea well-endowed women trying move attract attention man woo calling handsome hot. More women animated meant entertain kids Sure, there's film vamp, anti-vamp wife who's insecure women sketch. I liked bit dad's presence school race important child race itself. Similarly, felt warm see importance dad gives son's admonition name-calling dad sees truth it. But warmth fizzles characters introduced disconnected slowly surely one all. You don't root anyone aren't scared anyone's safety threat villain poses. In fact, villain isn't given enough screen time make impact all; hogged Ajay Devgn childish antics. This even evident room given "rub-doot", cartoon eraser. Those 5-7 minutes screen time thoroughly enjoyable. I wish fun times spent writing meatier bits characters. Over superior animation done thus far, need superior writing - animation not. The wonderful glimpse get makes wonder, couldn't more. For moments, I might send kids watch film. Or maybe wait DVD rent. Or maybe not. Or whatever.
