As hard believe, Tees Maar Khan subtly remarks state country. National treasure passed administrative authorities thugs. What else it, commentary, thugs make mockery law order system - standing smack middle courtroom? All "con artist" pulling heist almost blessings police. Trying make sense non-stop chaos rest film is, subtleties may seem like accidents. But, give one them. Using village full village fools representatives, filmmakers certainly pointing big fat finger us, audience laps stuff name masala. I didn't grow watching Keislowski Fellini. Far it. I brought love masala-makers turned filmmakers. I laughed cried actors characters played. Then too, world ruled stars. But I laugh contempt weep one person - me. A part audience. How definition masala entertainment change coherent story broadly set-up plot strung together plainly written sub-sequences? When strong romantic undercurrent transform Sheila romancing jawaani hero overtly superficially caring modesty? The thing seems come decades random breaking song dance. Oh well, Jai Ho? I agree Katrina Kaif played annoying bimbo perfection, then, acting all? I don't mean insult, I question choice role. I cannot even bring comment Akshay Kumar's loud utterances words seem getting sentence. Because time, he's either saying "ta...f ki izzat ..something..tees maar khan...something..." narrating what's going happen story next 20 minutes. Incidentally word "tawaif" (haaaw, I said it!) beeped per censor requirements. And I think Farah Khan last laugh one end hearing "beeeep..f..ki izzat..." That one cracked up. And couple jokes. I know supposed laugh silliness. But I demand silliness funny lame. I'd like respect woman (Farah) making film, it's difficult process, I admit. But, I'd like little respect return, sense sensibility.
