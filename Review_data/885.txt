After lead pair, two crooks, brought together police van crimes committed separately, predictably lamely falls love, Tamanchey like love story couple faces wrath families love. Only family replaced lady's boyfriend happens wrathful powerful goon himself. For group criminals, allowed liberty fowl language, also making film little different regular family drama. But element film get interested, let alone keep there. It kind nice love story made without mush don't even sense chemistry couple let-down. This despite lots lots screen time plenty one intimate scene two. The writing, every aspect - dialogue, characterization, story arc - completely lackluster. And that's crux lies. When pretty much whole plot predictable much interest actual ending goes. When characters flat arch matters little carry shade grey. When focus making film overtly typical real life criminal would talk, superficiality in-your-face nature dialogue shines lines itself. There little Richa Chadda Nikhil Dwivedi performances. They right expressions seem mechanical. Either like kind stress like don't heart it. Just one cases hard work shows instead seeming effortless. Given "different" setting love story Tamanchey could spark could've made least film watching once, good film. That know now, didn't quite work out.
