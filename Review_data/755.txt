This review tribute friends complain reviews don't tell story. Once upon time, lived little boy called Bukka. The trauma weird name first scar mind. It symbolic would seem like troubled childhood. The damage brain caused creepy voiceover narrator told bedtime stories. Bukka made nightmares real others, actual life. When boys girls age learning color within lines, looked creative ways spurting blood big, fat black ants. It wouldn't surprise found father actually designed new instruments hone skill. These toys loved father. The person ever loved. (yeah, yeah, right place. This review Rakht Charitra I) As grew older, graduated frogs, rats, eventually humans. Such Bukka's love killing new ways that, one men found dead, would get disgusted clich√©d murdering style was, kill one two henchmen, happened around. He never needed reason kill. His father, Nagmani Reddy, usually someone handy serve specimen. Nagmani politician. Nagmani insecure, second-wrung politician. Nagmani led easily-influenced, pawn politician, another Reddy. Other Reddy politician trusted rightman Veerbhadra. Now point (which 7-10 minutes film), I think hard, I'm sure I'll remember offended killed whom. And always someone wanted revenge. But, I'm inclined stress memory. Because I don't think Ram Gopal Varma/Prashant Pandey care much that. Their intention set clear stage next Rakht Charitra threatening knock doors exactly 4 weeks. But still 2 hours fill could get there. So, put exhibition goriest gore possible. And shed pretentions giving us reason. Unfortunately, impressed output added last 15 minutes make whatever happened thus far, redundant. While I begun enjoying gore certain extent (so I still squirm), I'm happy child there's meaning story behind it. And happened last 15-30 minutes. The story presents interesting 'what if' sequel I bump rating bit. Though glimpses felt like same. Else, Rakht Charitra pulp action, David Dhawana/Priyadarshan comedies slapstick - brainless, story-less, motivation-less. * Ps. In world gore, don't assume place women. Albeit two functions serve objects satisfy lust cry feed men. Pps. I question. If Aakrosh get trouble derogatory remarks CBI officials , come one bothered practical absence law enforcement agencies Rakht Charitra? Ppps. Oh yeah, actors growl widen nostrils well! The background music growled camera looked like nostrils wanted widen beyond capacity. O-kay enough nonsense!
