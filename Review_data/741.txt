It happened one night. Or it? A boy girl met party - middle-aged. They drunk, naughty. Is inevitable physics-chemistry-biology play role? If 'it' happened, would 'that' happened? If 'it' didn't happen, okay, even thought unmentionable occurred parties. Is worse one married attached without legalities coming way? All questions might plague drawing room conversation urban suburbia. They put forth subtly sensitivity. Also maintain interest nice build-up. But unfortunately it's towards unworthy climax. So much everything thus far seems vain. But, look back realize though didn't leave impact interesting characters spread film. Each friends group going different phase his/her life. An elderly couple come terms life found way enjoy it. Another couple seem wonderful understanding other, much seemed bored other. And hence get situations complicate life. It might seem unnecessarily maybe that's way keeping life interesting. Another couple going initial phase incompatibility, getting upset, lovey-dovey cajoling. The interactions group tell even simplest people complicated emotions. While performances you'd expect - Rajat Kapoor, Ranvir Shorey. The one surprise Dalip Tahil. Let alone talent, seeing something different refreshing. Thanks whoever cast him, get see non-caricatured Dalip. Also, one thing I've always admired Neha Dhupia though typical roles seductress, films chooses something different them. Here plays mystery woman, pretty efficiently. Had low budget-induced low-quality texture film, I think performance would effective.
