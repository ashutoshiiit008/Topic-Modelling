Jaane tu sweet, saccharine sweet. It's fun, peppy sweet. Yet reach heights lasting entertainer, mainly sudden limp story 3/4ths way line. It came across aimless rather random that. However, spoof-ish undercurrent running movie completely adorable. The digs things "Hindi cinema" thoroughly enjoyable. And I could almost sense writer hearty laugh audience lap up, mother clichéd climaxes, without complaining. The college campus feel movie going make young identify characters situations. And slightly less young enjoy nostalgia. I liked way various relationships built. Be mother-son, father portrait-son, brother-sister, course friends lovers - equations came across well yet anti-climatic feel it. Genelia Imran Khan bring breath freshness screen. It's much timing it's natural, much needed casualness afford characters make dear audience. I especially liked insecure, confused, disappointed body language Genelia presented second half. We know sure long haul, least chirpy, less serious kind roles. Anything "Aamir Khan" music adds ambience movie true one too. So, even forced number like "pappu can't dance" find swaying music. While isn't shred doubt "kabhi kabhi aditi" one romantic numbers come recent times, "pappu can't dance" "nazre milana" also grown repeated hearings. To honest, I don't feel right judging movie sitting corner seat third row (from screen). The camera angles, colors, sound - seem me. So, I think it'd unfair make comment aspects. So, yeah, I smile throughout movie base story little disappointing terms originality. I felt little cheated ultimate turn events somehow didn’t go tone movie thus made land "much ado nothing" category.
