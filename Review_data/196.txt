A producer casts son, grandchild, film, desperate. And watching Dr. Anuuj Saxena's non-acting non-skills, seems crossed really high threshold desperation. I mean, I want go back coma he's vegetable condition half film, there's something wrong Doctor, no? Ok, that, least fact Udita Goswami cast nurse wears pink, tight mini-skirt top, give desperation away? Actually, I shouldn't caustic. At least attempt story half interesting characters. But, I guess sympathize spend 100 minutes watching Udita trying act sexy. I'm praying dreams won't feature her. Or woman, Tareena Patel. Or men. Least police officer lisp main lead God-awful diction. Oops, I already complained him, didn't I? Well, point story half bad, way many continuity jerks. Especially, action sequences. An action flick action I see appreciate slick. But one, it's like tight budget editing tools used cover difficult-to-do action sequences rather make fast-paced thriller. Oh well, another one skipped unless absolutely-absolutely nothing do.
