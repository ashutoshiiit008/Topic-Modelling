Note meetu - Diwali Fridays one worst dilemmas. wogma vs. family - couple high-profile films year versus annual extended family get-together? Invariably, I end choosing family. Afterall, many Fridays one Diwali year. Handing Poonam, who's reviewing Golmaal 3 me. Thanks ton! Means much! Wish bright Diwali brighter year ahead! * For someone like me, often asked question – keep brains home watching movie?, Golmaal 3 pretty much puts good defense favour brainless comedies. Brainless because, predictably, isn’t groundbreaking plot memorable twists, yet enjoy ride anyway. What works Golmaal 3 distinctiveness characters fair share spotlight them. If this, movie could easily one aimless chaotic drone, considering bevy harebrained, crazy characters. Set Goa, movie kept afloat incessant squabbles gang five aimless cons (Ajay, Shreyas Arshad, Tusshar Kunal) aided delightfully dishy chick (Kareena) earnest elderly couple (Mithun Ratna Pathak Shah). Add mad, forgetful goon (Jhonny Lever) two ‘retro’grade henchman - therein lies endless possibility mindless wit situational comedy. It director Rohit Shetty want repeat mistakes previous one (yeah, I know last year’s Diwali release Golmaal 2 also hit, but..) – crutch characters. Even Kareena’s character seamlessly woven narrative equal share boys. Yet movie loses plot, makes abundance wealth jokes, funny one-liners, spoofs situational comedies. The movie one long standup comedy show where, story, wait punches delivered. (I laughed even cliché ones.) Rohit Shetty also interspersed movie several Bollywood references. There spoof rich girl, poor boy love story, atypical Bollywood 70s. Prem Chopra plays cameo reminiscent old times, Mithun da receives tribute sorts living ‘Disco Dancer’ again. Then, Hum Saath Saath Hain playing family drawing room Ghajni lends creditable gimmick plot. Jokes fellow actors find place too, predictably Emran Hashmi features. Shahid called Kameena (y), could interpreted one ways, dig even Kareena’s ‘zero figure’. Music fun high-intensity, even noteworthy (not surprising, since mood mirthful). Two tracks, Disco Dancer Yaad Aa Raha Hai, Mithun da’s old movie, Disco Dancer. See, I mean tribute Mithun Da. Movie also replete characteristic Rohit Shetty-esque quirks – action scenes cars smashed, chase, Golmaal vehicle - 5-seater motorbike time, elaborate opening sequences. The fast-paced screenplay heavy slapstick couldn’t executed without chemistry, camaraderie comic timing cast. And many lead characters, fair credit actor making quirks stand out. Though Ajay Devgan got grungy makeover, also edge masterstrokes bestowed character. The two talented actors I felt bad Mukesh Tiwari Ashwini Kalsekar, little much ignored one. I also want send shout-out costume/dress designers made unobtrusive contribution humor (not mention bright look feel)– typical costumes 70s Mithun Ratna wear, note Jhonny Lever’s pants (Rajesh Khanna? :P) dapper henchmen. Also, I intrigued actors comedies easily carry violet, firozi (sky blue) pink shirts well colourful pants. That said, movie without flaws, end doesn’t come big bang. Instead, climax takes droll course maddening chaos characters present screen. Also, movie could done editing scissors blot repetitions. In addition, sometimes sequence, example one Mithun th dog, audience patiently waited chaotic caper subside, awaiting new joke. Melodrama 70s story playing Mithun Ratna outside church another sequence felt bit stretched. Yet, bottom-line laugh. Even cynic watch wide smile, minus many cringes. Here’s hilarious Diwali.
