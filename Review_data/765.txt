I never fan animation films; somehow I find “squeaky” terms animation sound, I far judiciously avoided them. A friend mine insisted go movie, went, mild sense unease, determined endure movie stoically. However, film turned pleasant surprise; something I absolutely adore - food. The last film I saw food Chocolat, used food metaphor sexuality, freedom, community, starred Johnny Depp Juliet Binoche. Ratatouille name rustic French dish made eggplant, onions, zucchini, film uses dish symbol send clarion call return romantic age, maternal love, tenderness, affection made tasty dish, rather sophisticated culinary skills. The film expands point stating food cooking needs democratized demystified expressed Gusteau’s (the Master Chef film) motto: “Anybody Cook!” Food, process preparation, seen everyday, easily accessible method realizing creative potential inherent humans. The struggle Remy (the lead character rat) faces become chef symbolizes creative aspirations, underlines point one’s class caste necessarily limit one become. Mastery mystery food badge allows Remy move beyond social background. In turn Remy considered weirdo fellows interest cooking food, rather scavenging whatever available. The film also takes potshots frozen foods fast foods, current fascination them, primarily due notions “convenience” “time money saving”. Being Disney film, rats made look anthropomorphic cute possible. But viewer, concept food cooked rats delicious better human cooked food may bit much palate. (Remember rats kitchen, uggh!) Food human beings fundamentally concerned purity; food pure cooked members social group becomes impure disgusting cooked Other (people belong social group.) The rats embody Otherness, difficult digest! (Pun bad pun!) Cooking food also represented unconscious process, process really involve conscious thought, something else combines intuition, sensory delight, discipline, celebration life romance; something have, something necessarily acquired. If food lover, watch film. If not, still watch it. This film succulent dish light spicy flavour! Bon Appetit! And remember take family along - food without family!
