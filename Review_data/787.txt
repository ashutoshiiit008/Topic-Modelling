If you're fan original 1987 RoboCop, 2014 version disappoint sorely. It none spunk clever audacity earlier film, takes entirely seriously. Thus, despite far superior cast original, particularly supporting cast, film rarely rises generic action film recent past. As we're introduced future unmanned robots intelligent enough deployed law enforcement abroad, American homeland they're still illegal. The scheming private corporation builds robots creates something woo American citizens well - man plus machine. RoboCop. Largely, plot film quite like earlier film. In fact, tweaks plot actually make sense original film. Also, gritty, hand-held feel adopted time round sync kind films we're used today. But really lets film screenplay. Predictable core, film pretends twists turns, ones spotted mile away. Like original, attempts commentary American capitalism political hypocrisy well. For example, seems quite typical American-built robots used outside country law enforcement, aren't used American soil. But attempts come across blatant, instead pulpy satire original managed pull off. There also attempt highlight how, matter what, beating human soul trumps cold machine intelligence. This, however, half-baked comes across looking juvenile. Surprisingly enough, Brazilian director José Padilha, cult Elite Squad fame, doesn't manage leave stamp film. It comes across far familiar word go, one sequence stands stays post film. You wait bated breath, instance, see RoboCop come life full glory, eventually happens, falls flat. If anything film stands out, supporting cast film; namely Michael Keaton Raymond Sellars, boss OmniCorp, Gary Oldman conscientious Dr. Dennett Norton, man responsible creating RoboCop. The two them, respective cheesy roles absolutely top-notch. They overplay characters right, film like this. On hand, one wonders world Samuel L. Jackson doing, embarrassing loud television host Pat Novak. Swedish star Joel Kinnaman plays role Alex Murphy RoboCop, doesn't get enough scope perform. It almost seems like merely going motions. There's fun watching RoboCop spar Rick Mattox, robot controller tactical advisor despises idea hybrid robot-human. However, doesn't much overall impact film, isn't devoted much time. This new RoboCop mere dejá vu, good kind. You'd better catching original DVD, watching Padilha's two Elite Squad films instead.
