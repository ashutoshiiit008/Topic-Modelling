Simplicity always feels good. Maybe earthly maybe essence lack exaggeration. Valu's charming simplicity, however, combination repetitiveness makes good watch patient. The endearing part Valu characters. And characters add create atmosphere village interiors Maharashtra. The language strong dash every-day sense humor. The rawness dialect adds overall appeal. But could also keep accessible larger audience. Unfortunately, language defines characters shows one facet personality thus end giving one-dimensional feel character. And make not-so-interesting get know them. However, I cannot take away fact every actor played role utmost convincing manner, making laugh understand one point trying make. Right politician's sidekicks middle-class government worker (Atul Kulkarni) - one enjoyable his/her right. The screenplay takes sweet time establishing characters. And time world great story narrate here. The baseline story one-line get. The villagers want get rid bull become menace. But layers interested peeling them. Underlying superficial "nothing happening" feel screenplay couple strong themes. Something way one line narrated makes think human nature. Is every human trying find excuse blame his/her misfortune? "Is bull really menace?" Nothing behavior screen justifies behavior villagers. There three people village donâ€™t want bull go. Why ones seemingly content existence? Is bull metaphor argument concerning society - abortion, affirmative action? There pros cons. Or one-liner yet another representation mother metaphors - The system! Is bull metaphor everything deviates normal behavior "system"? Most people want rid it, handful doesn't mind co-existence. As see, I good metaphors. All I know director trying say little obvious. And I think that's inherent beauty metaphorical work. It's open interpretation. Oh well, let's come back seen. The camera breathtakingly captures curves rugged terrain. And tandem, actors given curving trajectory gives frames captivating beauty. This especially true scenes bull chased. Yet, put together, Valu adorable necessarily must watch everyone. For people enjoy language, maybe. But otherwise, without "really good" subtitles might end quite tedious.
