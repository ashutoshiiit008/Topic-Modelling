Last night watching Shootout Lokhandwala (SAL) I beaming joy, gloating pool pride I proud Apoorva Lakhia’s directorial skills I spot prediction. Yes people, Shootout Lokhandwala complete bukwass philum. I really feel sorry expected gangster rap rocking, yaar mix 5 star class pasta roadside vada paav would end beswadi khichadi. And that’s exactly SAL is, neither classy commercial film gut-retching reality flick. All entire 2 hours 15 minutes wait torture get can't even afford walk shelling 250 Rupees behind miserable effort. But worry much, already bought tickets yet see it, noteworthy aspects (and thank God that). Sanjay Dutt sexy slouchy walk - Man, way walks simply mind-blowing. Not exaggerating old-dude put even happening male model ramp shame. It’s surprise fondly nicknamed Deadly Dutt. Amrita Singh Maya Dolas' mother - Now without makeup look little freaky blended performance psychopath emotional mother quite believable. In opinion done much better job male co-actors. National Anthem - In Mumbai multiplexes mandatory stand listen National Anthem start film, far I re-collect enjoyable 3 minutes stretch last night’s show. Now moving bitchy side, points (and advices) make film thakela watch. Tusshar Kapoor Ronit Roy seem much influenced Ekta Kapoor’s saas-bahu serials, chest hair seem appear disappear conveniently characters K-serials. What heck wrong Suniel Shetty’s accent? The man realize can’t carry stylishly apna Sallu baba. A total waste Bindass Babe Rakhi Sawant. She infact given screen time duds like Dia Mirza Neha Dhupia. So much money still kanjoos Mr. Sanjay Gupta could even arrange decent body double Abhishek Bachchan Dubai Don. Over dosage Item Songs. Vivek...Vivek...Vivek, oh boy! I feel sad you. No jokes I really well-wisher I advise move on, move tango Mrs. Rai Bachchan acting Bollywood. Sanjay Gupta desperately needs change production house’s name White Feathers Black Feathers, maybe insertion Black could finally get rid-off bad voodoo start making watchable movies. Apoorva Lakhia, offenses seem gone bad worse every film yours. Its time realize ain’t thing, joining Balaji Telefilms? As see above, I could go I won’t. Instead I shall leave apt one-liner exhaled dude, credit titles - "Gupta, Kya F***all Picture Hai".
