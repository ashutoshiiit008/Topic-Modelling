The title power touch urban, nuclear family. And I wouldn't surprised joint families not-so-few households smaller towns would similarly affected title. (Now whether acknowledge different issue altogether.) O unannounced guest - likely Indian phenomenon - thou depart lifetime? The humor title sustained film. It's laugh loud comedy, it's subtle either. It keeps smile day-to-day life echoing screen. The writer tries real hard balance two generations; village simpleton smartened, outwardly-hardened suburbanite. One value system intact, needs little bit dusting reach embedded 'good guy'. As one imagine, stereotypes place. But manage get without stepping many toes, hard. You can't point one event sub-plot say, "hey, one that!" And yet, steps slapstick-villa preach-zone every while. It makes go cringe-cringe. And times Ajay Devgn Konkona Sen Sharma go over-the-top. And makes go cringe-cringe too. Sure, cringes smiles laughs. At silliness, good jokes repetitions work. There also songs parodies old, popular songs. Much fun entertainment are. And Paresh Rawal - perfect annoying, intrusive, meddling house-guest! It fun watching clean, nice comedy. Yet much missing! Atithi also another attempt Hrishikesh Mukherjee/Basu Chatterjee type film. There even tribute Hamari Bahu Alka. But Atithi gets nowhere close charm warmth films exude. But sarcasm hard miss. And sarcasm ain't fun. I mean parents today sure can't teach kids Sanskrit shlokas like older generation can't teach polished English higher level Mathematics. Anyway, shouldn't done people trained - teachers?! Then, what's point whole sub-plot. Why use belittle parents doing? I could literally go issue. These stereotypes learn live with. We flare see films, move on. SO. Yeah, Atithi serious wants say, serious. But tries best keep light. Keep laughs going. And decent job it, too.
