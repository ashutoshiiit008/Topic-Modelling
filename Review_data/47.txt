After biopic Marathi poet-saint Sant Tukaram, director Chandrakant Kulkarni back something little alley. A dramatic, often humourous slightly silly, take political bureaucratic class country, attempt show sometimes takes strong get difficult things done despite heavily flawed system part of. Aajcha Divas Majha remains watchable primarily strong anchor character Chief Minister Maharashtra, performance Sachin Khedekar terrific role. Strong, upright, honest, slightly egotistical also always conscientious, Vishwasrao Mohite current Chief Minister Maharashtra; one fought devious political manoeuvres, within party, retain post. Aajcha Divas Majha tells story one particular day life, decides take system right top of. Like character-based dialogue driven dramas, (particularly comes Indian regional films), Aajcha Divas Majha, despite ranging silly far-fetched downright implausible, also nearly continuous, indulgent fun. The humour spans gamut loud campy sharp, perhaps way film could treated hold audience long. Underneath silly humour, film also commentary manner first response request politicians bureaucrats is, “No, can’t done,” followed long-drawn period needless paperwork, followed invariable nepotism, scams, corruption likes. My chief grouse film fact every character film except three - Chief Minister Vishwasrao Mohite, PA, Shinde, Mr. Rahimatpurkar, top IAS official CM takes - seems buffoon. Because this, silly humour I mentioned earlier pervades entire runtime film. Also, despite film well-intentioned, noble symbolism behind cause CM takes up, cause quite absurd, often make wonder rationale behind it. Needless say, Sachin Khedekar walks away top honours film. What manages do, character, show us kind leader need country. True, character written slightly populist; even honest strong-willed politicians real life rarely ever take system way film. But Khedekar makes us forget two-and-a-little hours lives. A far real character, almost equally well played Mahesh Manjrekar, IAS big shot, Rahimatpurkar. Representative ails bureaucracy despite number dynamic intelligent people it, perfect foil idealism CM Vishwasrao Mohite. Another character wins heart, albeit clearly manipulative manner, Shinde, plays PA CM. Slightly reminiscent character Paresh Rawal Shankar’s ‘Nayak – The Real Hero’, caught adhering protocol, going tide man boss. Played quite well Hrishikesh Joshi, always pleasing presence anyway, often makes smile. A small word late Rajen Kothari, cinematographer film. A man shot many films gone commercial norms film industry, work film good usual, though I suspect digital capture projection didn’t justice it. His presence, course, sorely missed industry. Aajcha Divas Majha isn’t great film stretch imagination. In fact, truly generous would go far even call good film. What manage though, rarely lose attention audience because, let’s face it, love seeing political bureaucratic class take on. It potential seminal film Indian politics, never even goes close fulfilling potential. Still, makes fun watch.
