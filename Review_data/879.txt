Malegaon ka Superman - title sounded funny first time I heard it, kind funny one avoid. Yet intriguing, known little village people - suffered communal riots mentioned passing documentary. What see film itself, it's making - film supermen Malegaon tried making Malegaon ka Superman. And I haven't seen anything heart-warming really long time. Supermen Malegaon soaked sweet irony. You blink might miss one. And done without overt direct. The simplicity subtlety things talked issues covered remarkable - intentional mockery film-making India hypocrisy film-maker exhibits keeping brother making career making films. In fact, making Malegaon ka Superhero advanced lesson jugaad. The number innovative fixes overcome budget issues making film simple lack knowledge amazing. And fixes documentary decided focus on. That doesn't mean we'll like Malegaon ka Superman. But number hilarious things Superman characteristics unlikely Superman (played Late Shafique) might enough ticket money. That besides, encourage enterprising filmmakers? Who would've thought we'd watching documentary, making almost-no-budget (in today's times) film mainstream theaters. We come long way, yet seems beginning - worth celebrating, nonetheless.
