In movie expectedly violence bloodshed prequel gorgeously glorified, you’d think you’d walk 300: Rise An Empire thinking red saw. On contrary, striking thing sequel 300 Green; no, colour. I’m talking Eva Green, delivers knockout performance – relatively speaking – battle thirsty commander Persian naval forces, raze Greece ground. In fact, unfair war considered domain men; film, women quite clearly outshine them. Even Lena Headey, reprising role Queen Gorgo, gets little screen time, still far impressive men-folk film. A lot events film actually occur time saw 300. As Leonidas brave, limited, band Spartans take might Xerxes Battle Thermopylae, Athenian general Themistokles waging war Persian navy, commanded ruthless Artemisia. The film makes big work rather thin plot, though, flashes back (and even flashes back inside flashback) show lead events film. While film eventually serve plenty one would expect – grand, gory action scenes extreme slow motion – film disappoints writing. Despite terrific opportunities story level – like 300, film also based cult graphic novel Frank Miller – team writers director Noam Murro treat ham-handed manner. They quite clearly itching get fight scenes, anything else. The film briefly glances rise Xerxes came called ‘God-King’, mentioned 300. There much potential there, well complex relationship Artemisia, almost seems like pity much screen time wasted watching blood spurt every conceivable direction. Even story Themistokles seems intriguing enough warrant meat screenplay. Apart fact Sullivan Stapleton, plays Themistokles, lacks true charisma, story glossed over, favour – guessed – slashing, slitting piercing human flesh. Still, film would far fun action least quality 300. However, quite case. Most film occurs night, action scenes dark, eye-catching one would expected. Add 3D glasses, you’re often straining make actually happening, even though general idea metal making contact body. Eve Green’s Artemisia, then, remains fun thing 300: Rise An Empire. She snarls, fights, smirks oozes raw sexual energy never quite given free reign – except one rather terrifying kiss – enigma lies way held back. The film ends note quite surely suggests third film way. A chance make amends, sure, looks it, expecting much would pointless.
