After considerable success The Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy, it’s time third film series - The Bourne Ultimatum. Thankfully, it’s arguably best far. Where Ultimatum really comes sheer pace story unfolds. Director Paul Greengrass maintains extremely high tempo throughout movie. As Bourne attempts keep one step ahead pursuers, Greengrass employs generous helpings handheld camera shots ultra-quick cuts keep breathless ride. Every again, he’ll give audience minutes’ respite, revving again. And Bourne certainly gets around. Even plot races Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangiers New York, city given room shine. The Waterloo Station Tangiers scenes particularly memorable. Damon plays straight middle. There cheesy one-liners here. There’s strong supporting cast, solid turns David Strathairn CIA nemesis Noah Vosen, Joan Allen sympathetic CIA director, Paddy Constantine British journalist Albert Finney scientist mastermind behind Treadstone programme. Of course, comparisons James Bond series inevitable. In fact, Bourne Bond franchises differences similarities, although it’s interesting see latest Bond film – Casino Royale – cuts back gadgets ‘n’ girls formula Bourne-like, gritty feel. Perhaps they’re inspiring – certainly couple scenes (a rooftop chase bathroom hand-to-hand scrap) crop Casino Royale Ultimatum. Greengrass keeps violence focussed. This gore-fest. The bodycount surprisingly low movie type there’s little blood seen. Which say fights aren’t brutal: Bourne often gets stuck works hand-to-hand, camera close it’s often difficult see what’s going on. The quick cuts deliberately disorientating – annoyingly so. The film serves interesting issues. Who real enemy? Where safeguards unaccountable government? In ‘war terror’, ends justify means? Other movies touched similar themes. But seemed fantastical 1998’s Enemy State seems worryingly plausible post 9/11 era. Particularly, one scene Ultimatum eerie parallels July 2005 police shooting Brazilian electrician London underground station, turned calamitous case mistaken identity. Of course, action thriller suspend disbelief. Fortunately screenwriters – audience – frenetic direction doesn’t leave much time pick holes plot, although one wonder Bourne’s miraculous ability find unbarred windows leap even maximum-security installations. Clearly, neither Bourne CIA pursuers seem believe adage ‘look leap’. And despite producing dispassionate unemotional operatives via Treadstone project, CIA clearly hasn’t kept philosophy senior management. Straitham’s Vosen, particular, takes every opportunity make snap decisions times crisis rather first considering options. Sin haste, repent leisure. He doesn’t learn. By nature, Bourne loner. There’s romance movie, though fellow CIA employee Nicky Parsons (played Julia Stiles) pops give Bourne someone else look after. Refreshingly, character Pamela Landy (played Joan Allen) gives one female strong role least. The soundtrack functional unobtrusive, helping pitch mood without overly noticeable. And that’s way – there’s enough going already without additional distractions. For Hollywood blockbuster, Ultimatum sharp, fast-paced tight. If go see it, pay attention enjoy ride.
