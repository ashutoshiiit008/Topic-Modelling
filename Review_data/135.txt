The audience goes "oooh", "aaah", "woohoo" every Milkha Singh goes through, first five minutes itself. And heart goes along too. Yes, long. Yes, songs. Yes, dramatized, even over-dramatized times. Except songs, works Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Oh yes, predictable too. But, isn't fact predictable first place? It true life story all. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag makes deliberate effort balance telling inspirational story making boring History lesson. With number slow motion scenes choreographed, lip-sync songs makers might gone little overboard trying keep things interesting. Sure, Bhaag Mllkha Bhaag told "He came. He Ran. He conquered." story, might made better cinema. But, would risk Milkha Singh's spirit reaching smaller audience worth it? So, once, Milkha Singh dance tapping buttocks takes, it. I sure writer, Prasoon Joshi must thought long hard left Milkha Singh's story added. It shame typical Farhan Akhtar-style PJs (Poor Joke) found way in. From seen TV shows, jokes instantly reminded Farhan Akhtar I watching. It took away otherwise gripping performance. Yeah, accent doesn't flow naturally, comes across trained. His diction slightly distracting - speaks Hindi English too. But, Farhan Akhtar smiles charming smile endear Milkha Singh you. The upper teeth jutting forward give it, I assume, Milkha touch. You sense Milkha's pain determination. You want go easy heaves pants. And want win. Divya Dutta Pawan Malhotra add much needed layers Milkha Singh's personality Milkha Singh himself. Their characters' aspirations pride show couple emotional scenes one Milkha Singh. Divya Dutta easily one under-rated actors Hindi films. Jabtej Singh young Milkha gets feel pain, despair courage. On hand, Sonam Kapoor usual Neeru. She's stiff looks like she's making style statement salwar suits hair curls. She little impact feel seen lead lady film first time Rebecca Breeds comes screen Stella. Similarly, Prakash Raj comic relief didn't work either, acted well, comedy seemed little film. If one thing tell Indian men going on, screen audience takes little either bikini-clad non-Indian women excite them. Anyway, discomforting was, Neeru Stella Perizad (Meesha Shafi) exist show Milkha Singh's priority - work. The little time spent Milkha Singh's transition one woman another tell's makers' focus - Milkha Singh training. I've always problem little time spent athlete's training sports film, matter minimal time underdog takes come speed film. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag satisfying respect. Milkha Singh gets long strenuous training sessions director, enough beg mercy Milkha Singh's behalf. Another huge section film flashbacks Milkha Singh's childhood especially partition 1947. The sequences little over-stylized era set in. But, styled well. The editing, transitions, interspersing pretty slick thus end giving bits contemporary feel. Again, that's takes keep people interested, it. The non-linear narration also keeps absorbed. As stay engaged, realise one athlete one victim partition. Taking nothing away special Milkha Singh's achievements country, especially times, almost athlete stories roots hardwork worth narrating. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag much salute man himself. It much tribute millions partition victims suffered sustained unfair life was. You also wonder situation, especially athletes, really improved today. In fact, couple cases I know, non-star athletes worse now. The conditions sustain in, politics corruption involved mind-boggling. Subtly, film also tells soldiers, protectors, worse athletes. It doesn't dwell much it, core film Milkha Singh's spirit. I want kids watch Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, I recommend take (Please read Parental Guidance section details Violent Sexual content). Not film's potential inspire, also sensitize parts history terrifying. Even terrifying forgotten taken granted. Kids know partition, best, story - India got freedom; India divided; millions people displaced. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag gives glimpse kid age went through. And course, it's also important see persevered hardships cannot even imagine. It's job then, extrapolate millions suffered. So, time around I'll take little ones theater, beauty seeing life screen, beauty life many.
