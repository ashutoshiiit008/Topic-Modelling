Even I know expect, even I know better expect sort entertainment crew, genre, I end hoping like least something it. I know film's fault, I suffer brunt personality. But I end disappointed I expecting be, best way I put it. There two-three things I actually pleasantly surprised find film. Some sort attempt story, even comes second half. The first half random be. And stylish editing general post-production action pieces. The color saturation grungy look ironically fresh rare Hindi films. Then obsessive, almost obsessed vamp - hardcore vamps get, induces fear "main" villain. But, none these, except maybe vamp serve specific purpose. They look like incidental main objective film - displaying action Ajay Devgn. So, story seems like exists part audience silly expectations like story line. The x-factor action sequences seem like exist filmmakers wanted didn't matter whether fit texture rest film - incidentally didn't. Not mention, I wondered once, covering lack creativity action choreography department. The obsessive vamp leaves little terms hope. The supposed comedy doesn't bring half smile. The dance sequences way generic film name Prabhu Deva attached it. The lead ladies Sonakshi Sinha Yami Gautam perfunctory could get. It boils - Ajay Devgn pulls film then? Well, yes no. Yes, us don't mind film long Ajay Devgn pulling stunts right. No, obviously rest us. I've enough films banking one star's stardom pull entire 2-2.5 hour film - Akshay Kumar, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan personal favorite Ajay Devgn. Sure either action, romance social message anchor film. But, I know I've enough. Aren't actors done films seem like them, STAR?
