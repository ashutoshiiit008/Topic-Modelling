Rajkumar Hirani knack attacking problem headon smile. As usual issue important, given events week, global significance, though PK doesn't necessarily spread wings far. While jokes slightly lame side, point made powerful even readers site might direct target audience arguments. Most citybred, Generation Next la multiplex audience already story-tellers' side. We would make arguments coffee table conversation. But beauty Hirani keeps simple. With single-minded focus attacks problem, quite literally, using child-like innocence. His use humor, didn't make laugh even smile, entire theater splits, especially first half. For matters importance, people getting right center without thinking through, important get audience listen. So, whatever works. What worked PK PK Aamir Khan. Sure, mannerisms feel little exaggerated became part character. After long, long character played didn't remind him. In fact, jotting notes, one point I found writing Anushka Sharma PK! That form another victory film. Not Anushka Sharma didn't perform well, easier remember actor rather character. A lot players - Saurabh Shukla, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahni keep film mark without attracting much attention towards them, small feat itself. Else, Hindi films proficient making caricatures Godmen welcome relief doesn't happen. But, PK one films would need extra points didn't do. It enough going it. Rajkumar Hirani films aren't great works cinema terms departments filmmaking. They keep background music, camerawork, post production minimum. Their focus writing, (with diversions form songs romantic track). And don't even rely much subtlety symbolism. In fact, films characters uni-dimensional get. Also, ironically, take major leaps faith films boatload flaws over-simplifies complex issues. It irksome times, yet willing let go. Because films say like is, keep engaged making point without becoming preachy. That full plate. Fortunately unfortunately, sometimes doesn't bring anything new person side argument. The concern I OMG Oh My God. Blind faith misuse blind faith feeds fear something deal day-to-day basis. So, points made PK drawing room conversations I might umpteen number times. It's good see point view represented presented manner make sense follow God importantly Godmen blindly. I would applaud finding balance defying existence supreme power. To say film focussed one religion would completely missing point. It us extrapolate religion choice, including own. How many us "get it" able internalise completely different question altogether. Every Hirani film coins phrase eventually becomes common parlance, "jaadu ki jhappi", "all well", "Gandhigiri" "wrong number". Fortunately, one don't mind taking.
