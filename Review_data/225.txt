No one say, "Dabangg falls short expectations." - Salman Khan fan not. The kind 600-odd youngsters come 8:30AM show; boo trailers stand Dabangg them; can't wait hero's grand entry - people certainly fall skewed sample set. But target audience too. Vouching Dabangg, behalf, easy. Thanks deafening cheers every line Salman Khan mouthed even non-verbal, action-packed sequences. Me? Well, I outsider forum. I try go flow isn't kind film, Dabangg. Dabangg turned I thought would - Salman Khan playing (for knows way); reasonable action; cheeky one-liners; good music; loads nonsense story cares anyway, right? In fact, I'll go limb say Dabangg even exceeded expectations - Salman Khan plays Rajnikanth; awesome moves fight sequences; plot loosely coherent. But again, I'm Rajni-fan either. ducks brickbat(s). At least, attack isn't animated shoddy computer graphics. And bad copies various films either. Also chick editor snap sew together oh-so-quickly. Hey, I kidding, I ain't Salman Khan fan either. Every actor film takes cue Salman Khan. Take one expression stick it. Be Vinod Khanna Dimple Kapadia. Oh, Sonakshi Sinha, two switch - disturbed-why-me smile-when-my-admirer-wants-me-to. Her role seems gone heavy-duty scissors. Only explain gaps character arc. Producer item-numberer, Malaika Arora Khan makes better impact memory Sonakshi Sinha. Films genre can't bothered things like consistency comprehension, one least makes attempt. Fails miserably, tries nevertheless. It actually takes time set characters relationships up. The script goes build background, too. But, rush wrap shows. The urge put action less story, becomes transparent. Thus starts race quickest character transition - good evil way around. The change glaring even harder extremes characters gone opposite direction. You remember 80s. The broad plot tries say something national issues, political social, dowry bribery. But left loose. Not I want preaching anyone. But elements don't find conclusion that's sort-of disorienting. You leave questions didn't look like intentionally so. Oh, look trying impersonate intellectual fart. Go people, go enjoy annual dose Salman Khan. I love see people let hair down, abandon care good laugh...or dance. Even tune wannabe 'omakara' 'beedi jalai le'. Oh, way, enjoyed munni song, check - original.
