Almost every character film sort past connection Baji, superhero vigilante. But manner characters written even presented, film appears lacking enough conviction create long-lasting impact. Baji definitely every potential one finest films year far, yet comes across dim-witted one – leaving state sulky dissatisfaction. Easily one films big strong idea, Baji falls short enough strong voice invoke emotions keep engrossed throughout. Having impressed debut feature Pune 52, I curious see director Nikhil Mahajan next. And Baji’s promising trailer added mounting expectations. While I wasn’t hoping out-and-out superhero film, I surely thought Baji would push envelope least terms storytelling. But never wildest dreams I imagine would pave way mediocrity. The film 11th-century legend masked man, protects dusty village Shrirangpur. His strange disappearance years makes villagers wonder man ever really existed. But mystery surrounding existence bridges present world legend. This sound extremely interesting; sadly excitement remains paper (if any). It formulaic shoddy writing makes walk path regular potboilers. The writer-director wastes significant amount runtime introducing characters appealing ways, ultimately hampering bigger picture. After indie film, Mahajan seemingly couldn’t resist urge making big-budget drama full mindless lip-sync songs. Instead advancing story, choreographed dance sequences relatively obstruct natural progression. This leads sluggish narrative stretches film extravagant almost 3-hours. Pune 52 fair share weaknesses, Mahajan managed impress original voice. He doesn’t appear learnt mistakes though. He takes slip-ups another level instead. Clichéd screenplay doesn't open room improvement, let alone strikingly predictable nature. One several takeaways previous film long sequences single, continuous shot. Baji deeply misses absence shots. The director’s over-reliance old-fashioned action scenes, over-the-top camerawork dismal production values ruin execution big way. He overlooks novelty neeed crucial moments. Also, use repetitive visuals drive point home totally uncalled for. Abhijit Deshpande’s editing lets time again. Baji quite contrary Pune 52’s minimalistic, natural-looking lighting approach, making appear needlessly stylistic various points. Post interval, almost entire village appears wearing black clothes unexplained reasons. I doubt really adds symbolic value story. Shreyas Talpade plays Chidu’s goofy character utmost honesty; however Jitendra Joshi’s outright baddy Martand stays you. These two brilliant actors pitted other, try best uplift poorly-written film. The cameos directors Ravi Jadhav Nagraj Manjule completely unconvincing. Run-of-the-mill fight sequences, loud sound tacky visual effects fail miserably generate much-needed goriness. This results ordinary hero-villain film. Baji certainly awful, definitely something would want Mahajan Pune 52.
