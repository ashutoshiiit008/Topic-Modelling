The mindset hear Boman Irani-Arshad Warsi combination expect "laugh loud" comedy. It doesn't help trailer points direction too. It pleasantly surprises you, starting satire, quirks all. Then takes serious route, even so, willing play along Jolly LLB seems like trying make important point. Unfortunately end though, pretty disappointing. The disappointment much decision taken court, due lame defence (Boman Irani) prosecution (Arshad Warsi). They seem rather clueless caught unawares time. Sure, benefit doubt given name character consistency. After all, defence callous, over-confident, arrogant thus complacent. The prosecution amateur confused moral stand. It also possible beens spoilt smart-Alec lawyers filmy courtrooms real life lawyers really always toes. But, leeway too, stage doesn't look convincing enough. If real-life aiming for, things work way easily. Like bribe drops 5 lakhs 1 lakh without much back forth. Or evidence pointed towards, blue. So forth. And I sincerely hope lawyers judges don't shouting matches real-world courtrooms. This overall inconsistency ultimately flat drama pulls Jolly LLB takes lot away satire started as. The pull towards gravity though meets constant resistance cast. How wonderfully subtle underplayed Boman Irani Arshad Warsi allowed to. No, over-the-top histrionics, characters played haughty simple-minded respectively. Saurabh Shukla gets role weighty enough play around with. While caricature, act twisted-but-straight-but-twisted judge something won't forget easily. His maneuvers defence worth watch - thorough 'babu' style. All help dialogue. A mockery dialogue within film calling lines 'filmy', doesn't make less filmy. It makes lines neither filmy enough applaud real enough believable. Further distraction caused songs don't belong. And 'promotion' song end credits becoming norm? Jolly LLB feels like undecided satire drama. It looked like heart drama, satirical moments came went film. That didn't make satire bad, made film uneven took focus away story - wrapped drama neither dramatic real enough.
