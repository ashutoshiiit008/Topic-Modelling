Though far perfect, writer-director Scott Frank’s A Walk Among Tombstones, adapted Lawrence Block novel name, comes across refreshing change. Perhaps sight Liam Neeson publicity material caused one fear film would Neeson play he’s frequently recent past. Thankfully enough, character well film treated rare patience. Set year 1999 (the period building greatest anti-climaxes, Y2K non-event), Neeson plays Matt Scudder, recovering alcoholic retired (for reason) NYPD cop takes cases private investigator, even unlicensed one. A Walk Among Tombstones intriguing air it, way through. Aided greatly Mihai Malaimare Jr. 's cinematography, propelled mostly Scott Frank’s mature, stoic handling film, atmosphere film biggest strength. Reminiscent often Denis Villeneuve’s Prisoners (though nearly haunting), film unfolds gentle pace. Apart mature treatment, film also gives us real hero we’ve come expect Hollywood film lately, let alone one Liam Neeson lead. It great see effortlessly mowing multiple baddies one go, actually get beaten little bit himself, still show spirit carry on. In one best scenes film, man draws knife Scudder; way scene eventually plays surprise you, underline sometimes makes much sense infuse realism cinema. The film also gives us pair unlikely bad guys. David Harbour, plays one them, terrific particular. There something chilling remorseless way do, though background motivations aren’t sufficiently explained. My grouse film fact slow pace spine-tingling ambiance seemed building something would grab gut, doesn’t quite happen. The film still stomach knot most, amping shock value somewhere would perhaps served film well. Then again, realize never seemed director’s intention first place. There’s message two film (through character Scudder himself, well interactions homeless boy named T.J.); there’s vacant, sepulchral feel draws in; there’s nice turn terrific actor playing character truly worth rooting for. That Scott Frank always seemed hold trump cards, they’re deliver decent film - one demands patience, yes, ultimately rewards feeling inhabited world outside own.
