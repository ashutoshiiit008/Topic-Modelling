He may cop, thief, spy, bodyguard buffoon - He's Salman Khan he'll beat people around pulp. He'll cheers whistles audience. He'll unique style hate love, cannot ignore even tried. Oh yes, try story Jai Ho attempts ignite human you. So, here's good samaritan (yeah, that's good is) Jai (Salman Khan) helps people wants spread idea goodness. Only hot-tempered, help invariably involves violence. A lot violence. I guess, Salman Khan film thankful time around character plays isn't looting rich help poor, give character shade grey. There I go again, looking work writing department film genre, star. However, I like try propagate "do good, feel good" idea. If only, movie stuck it, itself. Unless course, idea common man beating every criminal sight - "do good". Aah, there's idea. And yet, military tanker vandalizes property, gets bit much, even goodness heart, goodness heart. I must admit though, change Jai Ho focused writing Salman's recent films. It doesn't deviate theme violence, occasional song dance number. It doesn't take romantic detour long too. Even villains want harass family members rather love interest. Which good gets, see Tabu play side character hurts. She stands tall, tries bring composure film, bit, still hurts. I felt sorry Genelia D'Souza too. Maybe character too, mostly actor length character plays. It difficult relate post-marriage career. Anyway, lead lady Daisy Shah quintessential pretty, dumb love interest bit cutesy "out sight, mind" characters, writers, audience. The actor actually gives performance-performance Naman Jain plays Salman Khan's nephew. Not cute, confident delivers lines perfect timing. Also, role written well - doesn't make sound like adult time keeping line boisterous child day age would talk. Otherwise, Jai Ho typical mix action, silly humor, romance, loud background score, ill-placed mediocre songs. Though, "baaki sab first class hai" decent lyrics. Too little hang film last 2.5 hours. Throughout film, I couldn't shake fact Salman Khan calling common man. Oh, it's character that's common man? Yeah right! Even sake argument, ignore Salman plays Salman film, ignore every common man common woman's brother six packs muscle power take 20 people one go. And without that, good spread word?
