Welcome world 'babes', one-upmanship, over-reaction. Welcome cut-throat world Hindi film industry, Bollywood. Or made believe. Heroine doesn't sink deeper two lines. However, like Madhur Bhandarkar film, spend quite time lead character, Mahi Arora (Kareena Kapoor). Mahi's character builds interestingly unfortunately story nothing ordinary hold film together. It's almost character wasn't written happened happen. It's great Heroine picks typical top star lead character, struggling actress who's rise see beginning. Her journey told us somewhere middle. At point she's distraught finds way police station reason told us immediately find out, can't believe pettiness issue. I doubt character writer/director knew there. But meanwhile, Kareena Kapoor gets insecure, distraught, failure, glamorous course bipolar! Though seemed depressed bipolar, hey that's nitty-gritty, right? But, point whatever Kareena asked do, works really hard getting right. She looks gorgeous even dispirited. And I mean good way. She takes every opportunity get labor shows. It effortless performance. The character offers enough layers - woman wants well career decent human too. But turns out, even willing put best, try everything within control resist sinking low, it's enough. And all, woman thus needy. There times, Mahi behaves aggressively, over-reacts takes actions repercussions hasn't taken account. Interestingly, really good looking actress entire clutter 'top' heroines Heroine Mahi. The rest, aren't half magnificent. Yet, struggles 'star', beginner. For change, also male leads sensitive roles, shades gray, however unbaked are. None side characters add meaning film except maybe Shahana Goswami's Promita. With textures, you'd hope story would hold interest. It meanders, stretches, disengages characters. And towards end gets overbearing. And times, feel like sequences, especially ones revolving around sexuality, added titillate without much relevance story. The run-of-the-mill songs slow film too. The two half hours run-time doesn't help case either. There underlying equation Madhur Bhandarkar seems point at, annoying audience, comments audience. While belittling hard-work people put work, Heroine implies entire film industry lives cut-throat environment manipulation key success. They films well masses. And masses supposedly decide fate film depending controversy surrounding it. Full stop. There there, question film's quality content distant one. The audience's love cinema based solely associated scandals. And poor media report dramatic effect that's audience wants. !?!? Really? Is are? Naïve basically stupid. Whatever. What boils question could ask Bhandarkar products – Is Madhur Bhandarkar's Heroine "Bollywood - behind scenes" telling us story heroine, ups, downs in-betweens? If former, you'd get reading city's daily edition let alone film magazines. And it's latter, atypically so, Bhandarkar doesn't engage despite heroine perform best capabilities.
