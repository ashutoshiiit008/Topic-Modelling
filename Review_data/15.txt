I’m sucker films based claustrophobic setting; characters cannot escape. Something like caught lift two hours. Or, locked inside house. Confinement, entrapment bring interesting layers human character. Perhaps that’s I love prison dramas. 12 Angry Men prison drama, rather courtroom one. It doesn’t unfold courtroom, rather set room 12 jury members must determine collectively whether accused innocent guilty charge first degree murder. From looks it, seems like ‘open shut’ case. You begin wonder you’re going sit next 90-odd minutes, case obvious. But Lumet’s mastery kicks early film drops clever signs impasse store. A hot afternoon, air-conditioning, wall-fan refuses work room remain locked decision arrived - hinting dead-lock store, nerves fly heated exchanges set unravel. Half-way film, begins rain outside time film ends, rain. That director kept mind nature’s background score, impressive. My curiosity film piqued last month I got hands Lumet’s book, Talking Movies describes used specific set lenses shoot 12 Angry Men - lenses would make room appear much smaller actually - thus adding claustrophobia. He gradually adjusted lenses way, film progressed, room appeared even smaller - adding tension. You cannot see ceiling film begins, towards last 20-odd minutes film, suggesting even roofs caving characters, almost protest, begging decision arrived at. I didn’t consciously notice things watching film. But I feel rise adrenaline levels screenplay film progressed. Which means, Lumet’s tricks behind camera worked. In process, story touched upon major issues - judicial system debates judgement, also made valid case important question obvious. It becomes clear doubt, questioning facts prejudiced holy grail decision making. When jury convenes debate trial verdict be, there’s Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda) reasonable doubt accused guilty. The rest vote otherwise. As film proceeds, questioning zest spreads members room. Sparks fly cans prejudices opened, empty heads filled lack interest concern. The jurors caught wanting swallow words. Each 12 jurors interesting unique way. Hats screenwriter Regiland Rose able seamlessly put paper different voices pen. There’s old experienced juror, advertising executive, man hurry attend baseball game, adamant self righteous juror unhappy teenager son, old hag thinks verdict obvious debate about, suave gentleman remains composed expressing point, naive apprentice, man belongs community accused. That’s diverse offering place around table. The film isn’t whether accused guilty not, it’s rather much reasonable doubt existing evidence throw up. In cricket, often refer term ‘benefit doubt’. In film realise it’s important consider even iota doubt clear way. It could save innocent’s life. Lumet extracts great performances cast. Fonda certainly good, Lee J Cobb steals show nemesis. A courtroom drama looks like uncool choice Sunday afternoon, actors enough layers keep involved, engrossed helping solve mystery. A noteworthy feature film debut, Mr Lumet! Despite nil special features DVD, except booklet, one enough warrant ‘must watch’. PS: Special mention Enlighten Home Library team powerful DVD cover. Love design!
