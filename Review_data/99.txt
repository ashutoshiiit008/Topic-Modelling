I dedicate review readers given feedback… For readers want write story - The basic premise plot sportsman cannot focus game love. How lame that? You want more? The premise - marriage, spouse idle, his/her devilish brain think partner unfaithful. Doesn’t matter madly love, ten screen-minutes ago! Do I need talk performances Puneet Issar best deliverer dialogues? The cameraman refuses hold camera one position, almost whole movie. And times does, nothing happening screen, everyone still melodramatic effect. This asking shorter reviews. So what, I bored two-plus hours, worth readers’ time read longer review this. But, don’t get used it, movies possibly bad!
