There times go watch movie get smile, feel sad, excited, dreamy fall love time. Slumdog Millionaire gives much more. In unique setup movie close real life time takes fantasy flight. Itâ€™s fast paced touches upon big issues (like poverty, slums, religious riots, beggars Mumbai, young criminals) bits still succeeds making huge impact viewers. The brilliantly shot chase sequence start sets right fast moving story. The brilliant background music sets tone rest journey. I loved way Hindi used start movie bring authentic experience viewers. Smart use background score helps shifting completely different scenarios ease. There movies make feel pain, joy emotions scenes flip Slumdog Millionaire simplicity. The work put making movie script, story, screenplay music shows. All backed excellent direction brilliant acting everyone. I tried hard find weak character movie failed. Though walks complex situations yet simple movie I believe would experience watching it. The switch Hindi English comes bump road eased change help good background music. And think illiterate kid Indian streets cannot speak English surely haven't Mumbai. The climax give heightened sense achievement, winning, content, sacrifice excitement; like rest movie, time! Director Danny Boyle pulled absolute peach movie. I sure Co-Director Loveleen Tandan helped capturing right kind Mumbai setup movie, essence story. Another thing makes Slumdog Millionaire unique experience brilliant screenplay, thanks Simon Beaufoy. All actors look control character Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Tanay Chheda kids Azharuddin Ayush. Anil Kapoor pulls role brilliantly. Remember supposed fill shoes Amitabh Bachhan Shahrukh Khan game show host, twists around adds touch character. Convincing Bollywood 2 decades knows business. The real star movie A R Rahman superb background score especially pieces "O Saya" "Latika's Theme" end humming long movie over. Thinking movie way back home I caught confusion movie dreams, hope, sore relations, reality life slumdog luck random boy. I convinced love. Yes love story.
