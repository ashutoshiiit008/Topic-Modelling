Why subtlety underrated? Sunday could much little less zealous showing - misusing music, giving colors extra-shine, overall video-album like tone movie. The basic premise bad all, writers manage squeeze social message too. However, 'whodunit' script can't escape usual suspects - never-ending chase, ill-placed songs, stretch-till-after-it-breaks rubber-band climax. Keep mind I trying best overlook improbable situations, continuity lapses, glaring loopholes. After all, it’s senseless comedy least making attempt sense. Got give credit it's due. What makes Sunday worth lazy Sunday afternoon watch sense humor. It ranges mundane tongue-in-cheek witty hilarious. And lines carried well cast - top (Ajay Devgan) supporting cast (Vrajesh Hirjee). Most characters individual characteristics help audience identify them. This contrast characters movies character could replaced other. It’s technical aspects pull movie low levels. The background score truly overwhelming times completely taking workload action - comedy, drama, fight sequences. In likelihood purposeful decision, I think humor would better supported background music stayed background, instead face making sure notice many songs yesteryears makers know. The camera angles place cuts many - called stylish watching 5-minute song MTV, 2+ hour movie watching big screen. Also, decisions use black-and-white bleach reel seemed rather random. However, transitions interesting creatively executed. One thing surely said songs two item numbers going arbitrarily placed. And Tusshar Kapoor item number - that's I call creative! Music lyrics something wouldn't remember couple minutes over. I see Sunday something could much better. Especially, considering decent dialogues - essential comedies - adequate cast pull off.
