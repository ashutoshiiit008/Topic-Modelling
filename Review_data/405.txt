When last time stumped yourself? When last time bumped something enjoyed it, something never imagined would give pleasure? That feeling newness, blissful ecstasy, would want ever let go that? This experience Veera (Alia Bhatt). You experience pain too. Yet, Highway leaves little wanting doesn't make part journey, 100%. Alia Bhatt gorgeous. I say first. It's Barbie doll look Student Year, it's cuteness, gorgeous actor. If you'd told watching debut fill screen presence, making feel pain exuberance equally (in one shot, too!), I wouldn't scoffed you, I would've snickered internally sure. From first shot tell young lady means business - Her disdain genuine boredom apparent takes along her, myriad emotions. Her comic timing perfect. Some lines could sounded silly, weren't delivered ease Veera. And Veera alone could watch Highway. She's crazy, eccentric. She's bound society's "good girl" tag doesn't realise could feel free feels she's kidnapped accidentally. There couple scenes point social menaces need addressed pronto. I hate undermine importance, scenes seem little out-of-place within context film. They disconnect Veera's journey though integral part it. Surely, Alia Bhatt cannot blamed that, long (background-score-less!) shots scenes something I haven't seen long time. The disconnect it's placed film. Individually, scenes great run part story, look like they've come blue. Similarly, even though Randeep Hooda done wonderful job brooding, disgruntled, helpless, contract killer Mahaveer, chemistry missing couple. Maybe disjointed chemistry intentional, unlikely couple - hooligan village city-bred, rich girl belonging well-known powerful family. Yet, romance kick in, root individual characters, need believe love - missing Highway. Highway's beauty, along mesmerizing landscapes minimal use background music (and lovely folklore used), pace. It slow keeps engaged. It builds piece piece individual characters grow gradually. But, pace everyone's cup tea. I would really love see film without cackling audience. Interestingly though, audience paying enough attention laugh loud brilliant one-liners equally attentive intense "social message" scenes come on. It likely Imtiaz Ali, writer might wanted focus message keeping wrapped warm yet emotionally violent story. But message charmed better. It new, profound, held glued - freeing spirit show charge yet, free spirit, need take charge.
