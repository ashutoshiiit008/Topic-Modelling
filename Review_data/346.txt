I don't remember last time someone's strong opinion shoved vehemently throat using medium mass communication. Maybe I agitated I strong opinion diametrically opposite one expressed Gauri - unborn. But point even anti-abortion, I doubt would enjoy it. Because badly made too. An otherwise fine actor, Atul Kulkarni, overacts. Rituparna Sengupta's dubbing bad distracting, difficult focus performance. And close-ups awfully made-up face didn't help either. So, inclined shut ears eyes every time she's screen, well...there's much left. Baby Rushita given decent performance, I can't help feeling bad her. In day age, parents mull introducing adult topics children right age, child even allowed play spirit unborn child? Let alone lecture emotionally blackmail adults choose abortion. (I giving movie away marketing department, movie posters say many words). Given factors, matters little camerawork background score alright movie genre. On hand, visual effects pretty lame. Granted, low budget movie, therein lies creativity, right? To make presentable product limited resources. The least could give child lovable character target audience would want reconsider decision abortion. Especially trying convince people abortion evil. People nation whose problems narrowed population explosion.
