Indians living abroad. Oh, rotten life have! They make identity themselves, especially sport. So, do? They make team Indians, naaah...these particular people Punjabis, make team Punjabis fight goras (Whites). Such convoluted interpretation liberalism and/or nationalism. Fine, I wasn't supposed expect anything else film calls Speedy Singhs. But, shouldn't least ghost story. Some conflict make wonder what's happen next. Let alone that, conflict predictable. So, then, stand-up comedian Russell Peters chocolate boy Vinay Virmani look forward to. Or not. Though, imperative mention I saw dubbed version film, means actors speaking translations English dialogues Hindi utmost ridiculous fashion, know like Night Museum Hindi. Yes, Rob Lowe too! Oh, I felt one favorite West Wing actors. The bhangra, toilet jokes, given there's Russell Peters, racial, political incorrect humor too. None entertains makes laugh. It felt like one films make go numb even short.
