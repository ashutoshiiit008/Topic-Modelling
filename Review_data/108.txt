Azaan opens like Polish war film. Both stylish serene. And slick execution continues well film. The style writing also seen main characters playing mind games other. But, unfortunately, none taken deeper. These things make first half film interesting, stay surface, rather check mark list to-dos. Action - check, emotional drama - check, romance - check. The romance draining viewer's resources patience. And despite fact romantic angle integral part story culminates. So, even though I understand necessary, I don't feel like tolerating it. And despite beautiful Candice Boucher. The missing ingredient context. Romance little lead lady catwalking wardrobe couple songs beaches. Sachiin Joshi inspiring either. I understand, character, Azaan grim serious actually reason emote anything else. But, must something personality character's traits makes want watch story two hours. I loved fact dialogue minimalist. There long silences lot reactions expression alone. It adds mystery characters plot. The story something seen non-Indian cinema earlier. But much done area bio-terrorism importantly psyche terrorists hasn't talked lot cinema. That addition proper use action gaping hole. Usually Hollywood action aped sake action. In Azaan executed appropriately. Hence, I'm willing let go lot goes wrong second half film. If I teacher, I'd give extra points Azaan effort. And give leeway improvement director, Prashant Chadha's last endeavor, Aap Ka Suroor?
