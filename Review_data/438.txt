I still remember first Ice Age released best friend staunch Shrek followers: kind would dismiss animation film. But saw Ice Age immediate converts. Ice Age simple, funny characters adorably relatable. But film, franchise became minting money rediscovering characters creating offshoots narrative. Ice Age: Continental Drift epitome exactly phenomenon – it’s formulaic, jokes puerile predictable kids might like it, kids like Bol Bachchan days well. (Oh, you’d surprised reactions) In first minutes we’re introduced regulars; Sid sloth (John Leguizamo), sabre-toothed Diego (Denis Leary), Manny mammoth (Ray Romano). Here Manny can’t bear fact daughter, Peaches (Keke Palmer), grown up. As movie progresses, gets separated family, along Diego Sid, adventure entails quest back home. They encounter panther pirate (Jennifer Lopez), walrus (Nick Frost) batch sea-animals led Orangutan (Peter Dinklage) way. While meant worthy distractions trio, it’s one many characters. The restlessness could seen, even among kids, time gags stopped funny. Even squirrel Scrat isn’t respite, antics mostly done earlier films. What makes movie worse unnecessary overdose wisdom parenting, love that. While animation charming find solace watching film protagonists same, plot becomes heavy many gimmicks. The jokes comedy funny beginning, that’s mostly you’ve watched three previous films. For first time viewer, Ice Age: Continental Drift nothing animated mash colors loud, overdone jokes. Here’s theory: fourth franchise Ice Age never going fun movie. There’s much recycle, plot gag-wise. At point, film get tedious, cyclical. It’s pity films released wonder films could made (maybe one film) much money. It’s vicious cycle.
