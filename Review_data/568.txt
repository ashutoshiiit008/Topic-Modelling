After seeing teaser Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush way back 2012, I doubted film's intentions first place. My biggest worry might end becoming another biopic high so-called patriotic statements ones question socio-political culture. As film begins, Nana Patekar's sarcastic voiceover (compelling, still extent questionable) appears following latter track. This theatrical commentary continues intriguing showmanship unravels. A biopic illustrious personality faces primary hurdle right it's story. For people familiar individual, barely surprises. And someone unfamiliar might feel alienated drama. So real challenge biopic appease people worlds. This Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush uses advantage masterfully seems history replayed right front eyes. No matter world from, stay gripped golden era throughout. If history getting see film, what's point going theatres? I mean, information always clicks away. This another challenge Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush braves, thanks approach storytelling. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, fondly called Lokmanya, played significant role India's freedom fight British. Instead directly bombarding history, director Om Raut makes witness struggles eyes journalist (Chinmay Mandlekar). Not film succeed depicting magnitude Lokmanya Tilak achievements, also effectively comments ignorance towards visionary ideas. Make mistake, film absolutely great piece writing. With due respect production values, film even half dazzling without Subodh Bhave. I doubt anyone (not even Raut himself) imagine extravaganza without him. Yes, dialogues splendid. But bringing life? Bhave proven mettle time again. But occasion, takes craft another level. Direction, hand, lacks persistence meticulousness. Some sequences needlessly glorified. Several key elements surely help disguise casual moments (read mistakes). But blunder comes close choice well quality visual effects. Some galaxy-like effects Mandalay Prison make whole effort look stupid. I don't know director wanted give divine feel Tilak's character. However, character powerful rest glorification appears irrelevant. Raut forcibly spoon-feeds almost everything. His eagerness give away outdated (still popularly overused) conclusion, questions viewers' sensibilities. Had let audiences perceive film's takeaway, would impact. Yet, despite downsides, Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush leaves gratifying experience.
