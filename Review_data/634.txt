Relationships complex enormously difficult. Director Swapna Waghmare Joshi probably took heart determined simplify filmy way. She ends making puzzling pointless. Her story appears clueless relationships idea future holds. To make stories engrossing enough despite repetitive nature film aims for. This Mitwaa falters right end. This so-called musical love story quite ordinary. Shivam Sarang – successful hotelier hates love, marriage commitment – falls love girl afraid relationships. Their friendship grows love other. But it. The director brings tried-and-tested, formulaic twists enthrall you. This drama, however, unfolds exhausting hour. Mitwaa lacks excitement, emotions, clarity even honesty; writing well execution. As viewer, part film’s progress. You feel sidelined. As result, don’t care characters come together grow apart. I found either laughing yawning emotional scenes. Non-linear storytelling indeed one several ways grip audiences. Sadly, I feel forcibly crammed almost every Marathi film days. And Mitwaa one those. You correctly sense story progress. However order contain predictability make usual story look unusual, director chooses spice things astonishing end. Well, I must say comes across asa masterstroke. But scene advances, efforts look over-explanatory. Meticulous direction missing film particular scene loses impact that. I wish I could speak several narrative flaws film. As I go details, would eventually serve spoilers you. Every time I see Swapnil Joshi new film, chocolate-boy image grows stronger. Blame kind films does. This time, spoilt-rich-playboy image emerges conflicting successful businessman’s role. I way mean say playboy can’t thrive professional life. The way character portrayed, looks superficial. And issue characters too. Sonalee Kulkarni’s performance contradictory background story. She brilliant always, yet character falls short emotional depth decisive moments. If seen previous work, know capable of. On hand, careless direction kills charm around Prarthana Behere’s Avni. Dialogues tolerable. Swapnil Joshi must credited making dullest dialogues sound outright witty. They undoubtedly lack sense. Camerawork vivid disappointing time. Its way showy, doesn’t serve visual treat. It overlooks geography characters instances whatsoever reasons. A hilarious moment came couple sitting next joked loudly, instigating entire theatre burst laughter. Though run-of-the-mill love story set Goa, fails exploit state’s stunning locales (I don’t know entire film shot Goa). Mitwaa might good business, purposefully released eve Valentine's Day. Nonetheless; film almost nothing termed even half good, hampering supposed excitement.
