In quarter century unflinching passionate romance cinema, I’ve ever jumped seat once, reaction goings-on film. That two decades ago, 1993, one earliest movies I ever watched big screen first Hollywood film ever – Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park. Today, two decades later, happened again. The film? Jurassic Park 3D. And again, I jumped exact scene startled bollocks naïve impressionable 7-year old. Indeed, I saw frame frame grand vision long, childhood memories experiencing true magic first time life came gushing back; movies always fascinated even Jurassic Park, front magnum frames kind I hadn’t ever seen before, even when, less year earlier, I watched Amitabh Bachchan, standing deserts Afghanistan, thunder, ‘Mera naam Badshah Khan hai!’ Whether 3D re-release film called discussion another day. Now film back theatres, time celebrate film man made it. Who forget iconic shots scenes, like first time Sam Neill, plays paleontologist, man whose life devoted imagining dinosaurs must like excavating skeletons, spots real live, walking breathing dinosaur, gigantic brachiosaurus, front him. Or terrifying scenes T-Rex escapes paddock nighttime, unleashing terror two unarmed vehicles, one children it. Or scene velociraptors kitchen. Unforgettable moments cinema history, brought life visionary conviction Steven Spielberg. Yes, time round, I couldn’t help noticing broadly characters painted. The simplistic manner observe react, predictable side track Sam Neill’s reluctant paternal instincts, manner Laura Dern’s character shown break gender stereotypes, Jeff Goldblum’s manic naysayer roving eye even great Richard Attenborough’s kindly eccentricity; seem vanilla – something Spielberg accused throughout phenomenal career. But one, critics take hike – film wide-eyed little ones imaginations us adults left behind years ago. As I keep saying, sheer movie magic, created spectacular technical wizardry. If one thing Hollywood deserves credit for, ambition. They’ve time pushed limits scale, vision VFX cinema, sparing cost attempting achieve impossible. Yet, many years since Spielberg’s cult blockbuster made hair, across world, stand end, I believe yet surpass achieved Jurassic Park. And yes, even aren’t greatest fan watching films 3D, one film 3D never hurts eye adds great depth frames; enough, least, mind glasses all. So watched film theatre years back loved it, children who’ve never watched film, never watched it, parents haven’t watched, – well list endless, I suggest visit re-visit film theatres. You may aged, Jurassic Park not.
