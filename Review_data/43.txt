‘Truth stranger fiction’ probably creatively deficient us would say Argo. Ben Affleck’s third feature director based real life events extraordinary story emerged directly imagination writer, audiences would scoffed far-fetched seems. In 1979, revolutionaries Iran stormed US embassy protest US custody religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini, wanted man Iran. As 50 US citizens held hostage, six managed escape embassy, seeking refuge residence Canadian Ambassador. Tony Mendez, CIA ‘exfiltration’ specialist brought hatch plan pull six Iran, every Iranian revolutionary baying American blood. Right time film rolls, manages get dead right feel - Warner Bros logo appears shield logo accustomed to, one used time period film set. From on, viewer sucked grainy, dated feel images, clothes look actors, little details like dilapidated Hollywood Sign establishing shot LA course, urgency actual story told. The brisk pace gritty tone film combines audaciously thrilling plot create one entertaining thrillers seen year. A film that, most, remains faithful serious story American citizens treading thin line life death, without losing dry sense humour quite simple agenda engaging entertaining. Affleck handles film deft hand seasoned filmmaker. Don’t forget, man won first Academy Award co-writing Good Will Hunting age 25. Structured built like thrillers are, Affleck manages inject right amount tension every step film. The result one almost feel entire cinema hall’s collective rising falling anxiety plan slowly begins playing out. Alexandre Desplat’s music score plays bit adding tension. Affleck also directs ensemble cast perfection - Bryan Cranston CIA honcho handling operation excellent, even though character isn’t something one hasn’t seen before. Victor Garber’s sheer presence seems justify cast Canadian Ambassador willingly offers shelter American refugees. John Goodman Alan Arkin excellent well. And even though one see regular twitches sighs throughout film, Affleck’s performance Tony Mendez hits right notes. He looks convincing committed, sincere ‘exfil spesh’ dealing personal demons handling one important covert operations CIA’s history. Admittedly, pace film drop along way, particularly often (albeit briefly) tends drift Tony Mendez’s personal back-story. The film also goes little longer necessary end. A minutes shaved could really tighten screws possibly improved overall experience film. Still, Argo film I would highly recommend, even though good chance you’ll make meal fingernails end it.
