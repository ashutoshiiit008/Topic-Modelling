President Bush provided us loads entertainment last eight years. So headshakes-in-despair. Six Indians represent billion us wait handshake-in-desperation THE man The President coming. It much comment obsession nation American dream - love hate - nation chose man twice lead nation! A Math nerd, farmer, stockbroker, wannabe-Paris-Hilton, accent trainer leftist novelist - motivated meet President Bush visit India. If wasn't diversity enough - one South Indian, one hardcore Maratha, another Gujrati, Bengali two "better-exposed" city-bred youngsters. You imagine amount fun medley cause thanks course - stereotyping. And largely without slapstick!! Filled last bit sarcasm, The President coming consistent typecasts initiates. It's satire sake satire. The characters someone might've met - work, family, amongst friends, friends friends. Which charming humor keeps engaged. At point rolling-on-the-floor-laughing, I found snickering throughout. Yeah, many ways makes feel good - Like one them, though chosen represent - youth India - foreigner. Each character also extreme stereotype represents, almost border exaggeration, know it's not. The writer takes brink believable character smartly stops. Yet, lot plot contrived. And I'm even talking basic premise. There tangents movie goes kind-of exhibit character's quirk. But, since 8 characters squished together 90 minutes, many remain half-baked. And yet, movie enjoyable like sitcom. Enjoy joke. And possible awesome casting. From guy plays geek Bengalooru possibly-illiterate stockbroker. Needless say laugh dialogues bright timed well. And combination occurs often enough. It one see lazy Sunday afternoon mood something light done forget it. No less.
