thehraav one word kept coming mind watching Lootera. Literally translated means 'pause' even 'permanence'. But usage applies better word used notes held singing. To keep voice cracking going flat holding note, singer needs control breath voice. This control see Lootera. And moment see using word applied music, watching film, know watching film, poetry motion. There points put what's going beauty climax sets everything right. I haven't seen climax mesmerising Lootera's. It's twist, it's revelation. In fact, predictable. It pure love. It shame then, makers felt need explain detail flashbacks repetitions. And I love finish, despite reservation. I getting ahead though. The first thing told people want know whether watch Lootera film takes slow pace seriously. It almost makers want push envelope long pause held, scene go without background music, on. It help film set 50s. The times when, likely, people enjoyed pauses. To top off, palace, majesty waning abolishment zamindari system. Amidst daughter zamindar (Pakhi) falling love guy who's job take advantage zamindar's situation (Varun). There something old school way Varun's (Ranveer Singh) relationship Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha) develops. Sure, distances awkward exchange glances also boldness Pakhi's demeanour associate 50s. Yet, take away experience. And course, references films songs era take charmingly back ambiance film. Also, along 'paused' treatment, film heavy grainy texture add feel era - something reserved flashbacks films. You feel like watching two-hour long flashback, like someone transported times narrate story you, best enjoyed told one tone. The camera complements tone moves like love object. Be Sonakshi street Dalhousie barren tree. The performances like last cog need fit well, make clock work. While one say Ranveer Singh Sonakshi Sinha got one two expressions, would unfair both. With limited range roles offer, don't know make performances. And don't know actor acted well not, safe say darn good job. After all, rooting Varun even though wronged people grossly. You don't think Pakhi stupid falling love, despite herself. You know confidence, know insecurity. And elegance shines both. A couple scenes stay long time. The dialogue kept simple. No way want interfere silences, neither want to. There little bit fun thrown every always keeps spirit film. There lapses way story plays rather looming ones rely heavily coincidence. And yet, sweet-paced travel back 60 years ago, let go those. If want action entertainment (in funny fun sense word), don't want watch Lootera all. It story, such. Nothing going 'happen'. It simple love story.
