I guess point Hello Darling bring working woman's sentiment casting-couch-types open. But isn't less crass way it. If not, isn't new way crass? At least none involved Hello Darling thought so. Where one begin complaints from? sigh After closed eyes mulled one bit, I think biggest grievance way actors used. I admit, I teeny-weeny bit excited news teenage crush (this "Videocon Flashback" days) Javed Jaffrey, male solo lead. I hopes team realized could carry movie shared belief slapstick. But, you've guessed, isn't meant be. Not yet. Other Gul Panag, women though really known acting prowess. But looks like made pull page book shrieking making faces irrelevant exaggerate both. I don't think fault either, I think exactly told do. And clearly weren't asked better themselves. Same goes almost department film-making. The dialogue goes slapstick - cheap innuendoes, scurrying around, slaps all. The songs "expected" there. Actors can't Bollywood dance bit made dance, Javed Jaffrey bench. I know one supposed expect films posters boasting man boxer shorts. I know one supposed expect much name, Hardik spelled Harddick. But hopeful wants like film, wants love it. Oh well, there's always next time.
