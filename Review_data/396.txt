Books converted movies always risky thing do. Not always work out. Even case something epic ‘The Godfather’, split better – book movie. I belong side votes book. And case ‘Hello’, I feel makers attempted bring big screen all. It much fact plot wafer thin makers chosen ignore basic characterization favor dramatization. In case, backdrop call centre incidental story unfolds. Therefore focus aspect seems unnecessary. Since always adaptation book, filmmakers could well rewritten backdrop make believable screen. The story simple one six call-centre employees working shift lives seem intertwined. And there’s night things go awry. The physical setting call center (from outside) looks genuine enough, inside, looks nothing short resort. Having seen call centres, I find hard believe six people working ‘bay’ time headquarters (i.e. US) looking cut costs. The basic one would expected IIM graduate writer screenplay pay attention detail make better use space. The story begins appealing frontbenchers Salman Khan item number (rather tackily picturised plastic water bottles, graphics don’t belong anywhere song meaning). Hereafter retires lounge helicopter charter service since stuck two hours account chopper repaired. And Katrina Kaif finds story begins. Shyam/Agent Sam (Sharman Joshi), Varun/Vroom (Sohail Khan), Radhika (Amrita Arora), Eesha (Eesha Koppikar), Priyanka (Gul Panag) Military Uncle/VP Chauhan (Sharat Saxena) colleagues would seem almost four years. That none good enough accent answering calls matter employer worry about, us! But group stuck work stormy night systems lives unraveling. Their evil (and conniving, yet stupid) boss Mr Bakshi (Dalip Tahil) common object hate group. All actors try best look part call centre employees. One could argue director Atul Agnihotri want typical teenybopper look movie since get identified bunch age-group 20-25. Why I think Agnihotri didn’t want typecast none look like fit age group. Especially Gul Panag Sohail Khan. As night progresses, childish nature entire narrative. While sequences book hard digest, movie makes even worse. (There typical references gays Mr Bakshi ok since American company). Of cast, Sharman Joshi shines cast confused team leader recently broken Priyanka. Eesha Koppikar hams way could better written role Amrita Arora spends time looking like dolled bahu dissatisfied life. Sharat Saxena honest role, doesn’t much again, characterization leaves much desired. Gul Panag role Priyanka bound catch everyone’s eye. For spent lot time showing newfound cleavage. It shocking see badly suited role. She tries dress like 25-year-old, can’t pull off. In bargain, manages look like tramp (and seriously needs help make-up align two mismatched eyebrows!). When author book screenplay dialogues, expected won’t stray far original work. Unfortunately, book written like screenplay, tough adapt big screen. One biggest negatives movie intentional name calling towards ‘goras’. As one-off, could fit movie. But repeated insistences like “the mental ability 35-year-old American much 10-year-old Indian” “Gore fattu hote hai” aren’t exactly best taste. The entire movie based ‘call God’ takes 5 minutes best. Whatever hear call promptly put action group ridiculous ease. Nonetheless, movie moments Sohail Khan Sharman Joshi screen comic timing, movie would nothing short torturous. With them, it’s notch unbearable!
