Update: I happened catch Gangster Squad DVD here's update DVD features. Packed unassuming case, single dual-layer disc holds film well solitary ‘Special Feature’, DVD Gangster Squad doesn’t make collectible way. A film panned critics, one I found brisk watch even second time round, Ruben Fleischer’s period gangster noir flick quite simply coolth it. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling Sean Penn hold own, film nice post-war LA feel, right tiny details, quite appealed me. The film DVD darker I remember big screen, killed beautiful shadows stood big screen watch. The true disappointment, course, poor excuse ‘Special Feature’. A 4 minute-42 second featurette called ‘Tough Guys With Style’, pretty much ‘Making Of’, one substance whatsoever. It lines key cast crew whys & hows look-and-feel film; amounts nothing all. Expectedly, DVD also 5.1 Dolby Digital sound well subtitles, English number foreign languages. And DVD players/drives limited number Region changes available, must know Gangster Squad DVD Region 2. While I don’t recommend DVD film, film always one I disagreed bit general negative opinion. Most hated it, whereas I didn’t quite mind it, primarily period feel cast. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ A film heavily delayed Aurora shootings – underwent considerable reshoot wake incident – Ruben Fleischer’s Gangster Squad finally hits theatres week. A pity, since January usually considered worst month release movies world over. Gangster Squad first new film I’ve watched big screen 2013, though isn’t great film miles, I’d still like believe 2013 movies decent, even slightly stuttering, start. Welcome post-World War II Los Angeles, place even shadows ooze glamour; three-piece suit Fedora wearing gangsters rule roost, law damned. And East Coast Mickey Cohen laying groundwork domination ‘Wild West’, ousting existing crime lords city. Enter upright, tough-as-nails cop John O’Mara, whose aim make LA safe place live again, child grow in. When looks like Cohen cannot stopped, O’Mara entrusted responsibility forming small extra-judicial team take care matters whatever way deem fit. With plot like that, supposedly based true story, kind cast film has, hard make film entertains. Add manner makers manage get period feel right - Plymouths, Tommy Guns, glamorous bars neon lights, works – end fun couple hours movies. The action scenes effortlessly cool; scenes virtually orgies booming gunshots. There even one superbly shot chase sequence involving cars really meant chase sequences. The film helped immensely cinematography VFX. A majority film shot night, generous play lights. The manner light supposedly caused gunshots used light scenes shots particularly interesting. The use background score excellent well. The instruments orchestral feel go well period tone film. But truly keeps film interesting cast. Sean Penn steals show Mickey Cohen; injects character electric quality, breathing unapologetic malice pretending sense humour even not. Josh Brolin superb honest, posterior-pounding Sgt. John O’Mara. Ryan Gosling, easily one exciting young Hollywood actors moment, seems whole lot fun icy cool cop falls love dangerous girl could find. His body language makes stand actor. Watch casually leans wall midst messy fight scene; keeps reminding actor watch for. The supporting cast great job well. Robert Patrick Giovanni Ribisi, play members Brolin’s team, excellent. Emma Stone Cohen’s moll looks great, small part essentially film men. As usual, film’s biggest problem heavily flawed writing. The screenplay riddled flaws leaps faith, many count actually. The manner Gosling’s character agrees part team, way Gangster Squad gets hold information Cohen, ridiculously skewed ratio bullets fired bullets finding mark, whole lot require large doses audience come dislike - looking way. In fact, writing film truly pulls down, ensuring never becomes memorable stage. Gangster Squad forgettable film, one wont thinking long done. But good chance you’ll amount fun watching it; enough ingredients much least. If, like me, believe real way watch movie big screen, go it. There’s good chance you’ll entertained run time. Otherwise, film well make one-time watch DVD. Then, I’d strongly recommend like film go catch L.A. Confidential, personal favourite LA noir film distance.
