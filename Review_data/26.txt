For reason, Western Genre film making vanished screens (the writer views subject, would constitute different article!). The Western quintessential embodiment Great American myth; promise New Land, wide open Frontier man could become rich irrespective class background, Men wild brutal times, stood justice fair play heart American dream. They featured lone Hero, stood truth honour acted courage required. The Western genre used allegory (High Noon – 1952) also ode Romantic outlaws give way face commerce early capitalism (Sergio Leone’s time classic, How West Won, Sam Peckinpah’s spectacularly bloody The Wild Bunch). Clint Eastwood gave genre another twist altogether 1990’s Unforgiven, dirty unflinching look entire myth Western American Dream. And years, 3.10 Yuma. Director James Mangold helmed several films before, never Western. Indian viewers might remember Identity, complex murder mystery, show around five years ago. Let state right outset, film action film. If viewer interested chases gunfights, well, film you. This say action; fact first rate stagecoach chase, quite gunfights, great climax featuring lots lots guns shooters. But difference action meant entertain elicit “oohs aahs”, instead used give us insights possible personalities characters. This requires well forged screenplay pays attention small nuances delineate characters also accomplished director, Mr. Mangold writers distinguish themselves. The screenplay works wonderfully give us whole bunch people remember long film over. A ruthless yet quite honest criminal also charmer comes women, war veteran rancher deep debt, veterinarian cannot shoot, grizzled bounty hunter contract, trigger happy young outlaw, young somewhat fearful railroad man, adolescent boy struggling man; somehow seem real present, empathise deeply circumstances. The director followed one truisms cinema, cinema reaction rather action, gives us tight close ups characters’ faces, contrasted panoramic country traveling in. The dialogue laconic terse, weaves themes justice morality. The film sing hosannas American dream; instead subtly shows us hypocrisy, exploitation, greed made America today. There sequence shown Chinese laborers building railroad tunnels, cheap labour brought America build railroad also work mines. In passing shot see encounter young adolescent white boy Chinese laborer nearly age, reaction faces says all, race class. We also come understand law legal rights almost always subordinate economic interests. Russell Crowe outstanding bad guy Ben Wade, puffy face lines around eyes speak volumes dissolute, yet intelligent personality. Christian Bale’s hard planed face something easy forget either; misery anguish come muttered dialogues set jaw. The film ends bloody brutal climax well staged leaves us feeling vindicated, manner really understand. Again director shows class, final interactions outlaw rancher well closing scenes, weave earlier themes bring satisfying resolution. The end remains true genre; Men must make stand irrespective bullets may fly means Hero. Thank God Bollywood multiplex brouhaha, let us films please. PS And love pulp Western novels films guns feature them, movie works, Spencer carbine, Colt revolvers, Remington sawed shotguns, Gatling.
