He done before, Paul Greengrass; I mean nicest way. Greengrass penchant taking stories based true events - usually ones already know end - still manages make gripping cinema them; kind fastens seats. The pinnacle still remains United 93, personally one favourite films ever. Using familiar handheld camera brown, gritty colour tone, latest offering Captain Phillips - film based real life Richard Phillips, captain aboard American container ship, hijacked Somali pirates 2009. Grim claustrophobic, much film set tight quarters middle nowhere, film almost unrelenting thrill factor. And many filmmakers choose handheld route tell tale, Greengrass always manages make things look like they're real happening eyes, oblivious fact everything is, fact, staged camera. The confrontation scenes pirates, led leader Muse, Captain Phillips easily highlight film. Watching terrific Tom Hanks, one career best performances (despite strangely jarring accent), spar young debutante Barkhad Abdi, plays Muse, treat, convincing Hanks, particular, is. Abdi raw times, mostly manages match Hanks; feat itself. The film, admittedly, makes better big screen watch, sheer nature it's subject. Thrills obviously best experienced darkened cinema halls. Yet, DVD Captain Phillips rich content, actually makes DVD must-own true cinephile. The important feature, course, option watching entire film commentary Paul Greengrass. There's nothing quite like director talk film, tell took conceptualise film particular scene. He also narrates interesting snippets; like Tom Hanks young men playing Somali pirates hadn't ever met filming first meeting film. This Greengrass wanted capture unfamiliarity nervous tension confront first time. Stuff like truly adds value, one wants understand director's vision really entails. And director's commentary wasn't enough, also in-depth 55 minute featurette titled 'Capturing Captain Phillips', essentially making film. Again rich took make tough production like reality, featurette another little gem aids understanding finer nuances craft film production. A single DVD packs film well bonus features. The Captain Phillips DVD one rare DVDs one must buy special features film itself, even though film definitely worth watch. United 93 still favourite Greengrass film, Captain Phillips, surges ahead nonetheless.
