You meet someone. You become friends. You enjoy other's company. You hate things together. You fall love. You begin hate other. Then, either get back together don't. Ishkq Paris drabber telling story way I've narrated it. Ishkq (Preity Zinta) - yes, that's characters name! - Akaash (Rhehan Malliek) go mechanics clinically, feels real. And aren't love stories making unreal feel real. Just dialogue says, "This true love story." doesn't make one. Nor lines like "I love Bollywood." "I love Paris" make us believe do, make words "I love you" sound like said writers couldn't think ways express it. Preity Zinta Rhehan Malliek try best infuse life lines. But, that's problem, effort shows. That besides relief them. There long scenes talking other. The breather comes Ishkq's mom Marie (Isabelle Adjani) screen, wish hadn't wished see faces. There 'aawww' moments, zero funny ones lots times film tries superficially cool talk ex-boyfriends marriages on. It try touch upon deep insecurities lady protagonist, turns age old, "damsel distress" protocol. You really wonder made Preity Zinta produce one? Except line says loud film, "So what, can't watch film, one stop us making one."
