It makes sense us pause, while, ask question, “Why believe we’re told, even haven’t seen eyes?” As beings supposed higher intellect, enough mental powers analysis reason, mention far higher level curiosity living species, would seem like humans would far individualistic creatures, given level unquestioning, blind following hero worship we’re prone to, reality. This behaviour species perplexing, say least. Also perplexing, equally delightful, Rajat Kapoor’s Ankhon Dekhi – earnest film straddles whimsical realistic equal measure, shows us journey man grapples question. A film characters, setting, texture lives, mad little moments come together complete various inter-relationships. The film set old Delhi – Delhi Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Delhi 6 – except get far realistic sense place here. If character stops kachori samosa, almost smell smoky surroundings aroma fried delicacies; almost feel cramped lanes overhanging winter. The characters mad bunch. There’s protagonist – elder family; man reacts mid-life crisis strangest manners. But much conviction builds guru-like following - strange paradoxical twist undermines question seeks answers to. Then there’s verbose wife sparkles sincerity, froths frustration husband’s antics, yet seems one handle him. And many more. Ankhon Dekhi much characters relationships, protagonist’s journey. It film walks thin line – almost borders surreal times, also showing real problems misunderstandings crop two brothers, family prospective suitor daughter. Rajat Kapoor attempts show us how, even circumstances never control, react circumstances almost always is. But also film tends waver. The goings-on, times, seem quite pointless, taking film either forward back. Then again, one could argue much real life happens seems point all. They happen to. For instance, inexplicable cameo appearance fine actor tourist looking Jama Masjid beginning end it. It happens explanation, need, yet isn’t something fault. Or perhaps can. The pointlessness seems point it. Ankhon Dekhi manages make smile quite often. Charming, moving performances Sanjay Mishra father (and older brother – one important relationships shown film), Seema Pahwa wife Rajat Kapoor younger brother anchor film, little bit parts ensemble cast. Brijendra Kala, one best character actors have, example, fine job. Ankhon Dekhi, then, often seems like easy film watch, also puzzle times. A study contradictions, gentle look people relationships, wonderful example film rooted still fanciful. It makes ponder it, makes want relive it, also doesn’t completely convince whether liked film not. It raises questions, answers questions. That, I suppose, film’s biggest victory.
