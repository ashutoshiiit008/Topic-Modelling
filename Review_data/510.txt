A chapter history begins geography country. The classroom effect hard shake made difficult Abhishek Bachchan digressing Math lesson straight mini-lecture revolution. After lame sequence, I didn't know whether I'd laugh cry next 2.5 hours; cast/crew wanted inspire. The audience around laughing. And grew louder Deepika Padukone's entry. The lady breaks song! BUT, things settle down. It's unintentional laughter dies, slowly, slowly hooked. And goes 5th gear post-interval. The execution plan engaging, despite complete lack depth characters. There 60 odd revolutionaries, 7-8 main ones. But none distinguishing character. They willing give lives cause, care heart soul, want make whatever little contribution can. Maybe time age mob identity personal identity. And yet, reactions different people situation eye-opening touching. You wait second half see though. Director, Ashutosh Gowariker's plan keep set-up grand plan first half, focus execution aftermath second half huge dampener pace. The portrayal aftermath interesting well-executed part film end credit roll good could get. Another decision either director writer made assume viewer knows history backdrop Chittagong conspiracy. This decision kept getting involved. Also, narrative like father telling story son, "this happened, happened, happened". A flow missing. A little background, little rhythm get viewer atmosphere characters living would made care characters much sooner. And despite that, I board end. And I think good basic plot do. As realize end, great dialogue, room brilliant performances, yet characters. The pathos created last third film gone long way that. So many characters given room true story thus film. So much that, star-driven world Hindi cinema, don’t see either Abhishek Bachchan Deepika PAdukone get way characters (until end, I guess justify Abhishek's fee). And fine. They crazy. Anyone leaves comfort home fights cause necessarily crazy. They fought freedom. Who say struggle, lasted centuries, wouldn’t gone 80 years? Who's say wouldn't stay McDonalds multiplexes along dogs? We don't know passionate freedom, were. The least aware story. So it's told engrossing manner. Not screwing freedom eccentric much ask for, right?
