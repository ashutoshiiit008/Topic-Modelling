Whatever expect film - attention grabbing promo; based newspaper story close home one us; directed person made strong statement debut, Aamir; AND aspires commercial success - delivered. It's entertaining, makes point reaches us. Then, even film simplifies struggle common man go get basic right, feels like keep hopes strong age scam day. Of course, state affairs live disturbing beyond measure. So much that, applaud something taken granted - honest bureaucrats, police, politicians. As 'aitbaar' song film goes - trust melting away. Thankfully, cases like restore faith however small extent. And thankfully, people film industry willing make films serve reminders. They also selected brilliant team, brings screen situations way might visualized read newspapers. And more. The story good measure details necessarily known people haven't keenly followed case. The narrative also kept interesting non-linear references Sabrina's relationship sister. The performances add already interesting setup. You love bitch Mira (Rani Mukherjee) cow Sabrina (Vidya Balan). You get story bit roles played reasonably well-staffed supporting cast. The earnest dumb, junior journalist Aditi (Maanvi Gagroo) funny situation put in. I loved way Aditi's side-story subtly shows Mira makes her. The submissive, clueless, simple middle class man, Sanjit Lal (Yogendra Tikku) makes feel frustration daughter Sabrina might gone through. The powerful politician's side-kick proud "take care" witnesses evidence. And impressive actor played inspector (name, anyone?). His role case huge finger pointed country's administration. I could've done little less dramatization, example entry key witness courtroom. But, I'd much rather see commercial success films like cater preferences. Isn't commendable, film serious issue leaves good humor, without taking away anything message. A lot witty dialogue amusing (or made amusing) situations. Another huge chunk credit goes Amit Trivedi (oh, I restrained saying 'the one only'!) His music combination Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics tell lot basic story itself. Sure, I would liked setup first half led something little less anti-climactic. Sure, pace could little better first half, might made second half look better. Yet, seem like mere nitty-gritty notice emotional high film left with. And especially compare huge reminder is. Of strength, choose use it.
