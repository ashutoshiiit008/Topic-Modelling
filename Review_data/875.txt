I think Zack Snyder makes film, reversing traditional flow-chart - first post-production planning, followed shooting. At end, figures perfect script graphic novel identifies story somewhere. Understandably, actors sets must rarely challenged - cool stylish effects, digital re-touching, mixing typical films, performances would boring. Imagine shooting bullets imaginary objects, piercing sword non-existent creatures, suspended wires surrounded chroma screen, time. Style substance, therefore, trait Snyder’s films. That still works advantage, since never chooses adapt Shakespeare screen. Comics - a.k.a graphic novels - rarely tried ‘substance’. Which why, he’s possibly best man alive, bring graphic novel alive screen. Sucker Punch confirms - command technique craft, sound design mixing, cinematography, action choreography, editing, visual effects, make-up, impeccable. Which why, there’s much visual audio stimuli viewer experience film big screen. And therefore I recommend, want form honest opinion film - matter bad - you’ve got head nearest multiplex. It would criminal experience Sucker Punch DVD, screen shorter big screen. Sucker Punch isn’t half good last outing, 300, achieved cult following despite panned critics. The adaptation isn’t bad, it’s story falls flat. Moreover, Charlie’s Angels-meets-Matrix, fantasy action thriller overdose blondes. The storyline simple - lead protagonist, helpless Babydoll (Emily Browning) sent mental asylum evil stepfather retreats fantasy-filled escape plan, finding set clues. Since it’s HER fantasy, magically rewarded samurai-like sword fighting skills well powers float around choice gravitational force, slaughtering dragons video-game essentials. Joining escape mission, pretty young things (PYTs) - Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) Amber (Jamie Chung). The plot defies logic bit thought morals script tries pontificate absolutely absurd I didn’t get it. You shouldn’t try either - you’re looking take-away film, bad idea. I however enjoy Snyder’s treatment action sequences, special effects jazz come characterise films - rich color tones, soundtrack laden rock music, slow motion fight sequences gore. The soundtrack, fact immense charity helping improve viewing experience. Amongst women, Jena Malone (who played Carine McCandless Into The Wild) Abby Cornish good, Emily Browning proves major disappointment. I got introduced - especially sexy pout - Lemony Snickett’s A Series Unfortunate Events, although fires bullets punches baddies pretty well, blonde hairdo ponytails makes appear dumb. Oscar Isaac’s performance Blue Jones, evil pimp women, noteworthy. Sucker Punch falls category films advise leave brains home. Simple may sound suggestion, incredibly difficult anatomical feat pull off. Our brains heart better together. Why then, Mr Scriptwriter, us favour working little harder.
