Once upon time, little village city called Had-bahedi. The people content had, despite knowing world outside lot conveniences. They always happy take it's given without asking anything. And world outside enters impose Had-bahedi. Yes, Chintuji fairy tale. And definition makes imaginary. The writer asking us enter make-believe world think, "exactly take real world". Nice thought. But can't taken forward given complexities real world over-simplification sake making film. There isn't much comment plausibility plot points whole concept intentionally unlikely happen. The actors meant behave like street play. They purposefully loud exaggeratedly comic. Sure, actors bit saving grace. Very pull adorable arrogant like Rishi Kapoor. Priyanshu looks sincere be. The rest vague caricatures represent Had-bahedi. What remains way plot carried certain extent strength dialogues. Both less mediocre. There jumpy cuts, predictable situations drama carried way long. The dialogues wannabe non-preachy. Like bolt lightning character asks insightful question, realization strikes questionee, immediate transformation haughty charming happens. Ultimately fairy tales unless fairly complicated make good stories children. But, since Chintuji corruption, politics, egos, etc isn't kid-material either. And fairly simplistic too. So quiet "well-tried" applause, ain't much give it.
