The movie uses lawsuits Mark, tell back-story came achieve did, pretty much like Slumdog Millionare used show 'Who wants become millionaire' carry story forward. And like Slumdog Millionare, too, formula worked like charm. In pieces, showed changes Mark's character time neglected undergrad time became billionaire. I've grown reading stories Bill Gates many people allegedly wronged path success. Its Zuckerberg's time torch. The movie would leave mixed emotions. You'd love Mark genius passion towards Facebook.
