How many times watched American film, character dials 911 cops come bursting door soon after? While scores films shown cops heroes, often laying lives sake justice, rarely anyone ever peeked lives people actually answer 911 call. On surface, seems like call centre – continuous calls, mostly silly, caller almost always unreasonably agitated. But then, lot calls, also hinge matters life death. Anyone read, fix problem cellular operator toaster. But 911 call different story altogether. It perhaps aspect Brad Anderson’s The Call fascinating, get realize worth anonymous heroes, fade oblivion answering call probably saved lives. Starting humanizing anonymous voices, moving actually quite taut thriller ultimately descending near-absurdity tries move kill, The Call uneven film engages often, ends leaving quite disappointed walk out. Halle Berry plays Jordan, seasoned 911 operator damn good job. One calls, however, doesn’t go quite expected. Brad Anderson knows craft thriller, much concede. And seems enjoy lot lacing thriller slight tinge horror element. His 2004 film almost seminal regard, frequently flitting boundaries thriller horror utmost ease. He tries something similar The Call, though toning horror element quite bit, making subtle visceral. Full marks trying, end result isn’t nearly thrilling horrifying hoped. The big problem film lies last half hour film. The important aspect writing directing thriller knowing thrill reached peak, easing audience peak assuredness. The disadvantage out-and-out thriller audience invariably catches up, making hard leave high, unlike genres. Also, premise last half hour absurd, goes fundamental concept film starts - life 911 operator. Halle Berry, role sleepwalk through, expectedly fair job. The rest cast pretty much stand watch thing. Michael Eklund hams bit psychopath, overdoing crazy quite often. However, quite surprise, I quite liked character written. The reason way is, intrigued quite bit. His character gamut emotions layers it, revealed bit bit, making unexpected facet genre film. Very rarely film attempt this. But eventually also adds climax film doesn’t work; also goes fundamental concept character. With crisp 94-minute runtime brisk pace, The Call often engages you, ultimately disappoints. It never unwatchable, never gets compelling could been, absurd climax final nail coffin.
