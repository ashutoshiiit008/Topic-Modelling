Very rarely Hindi cinema say - significant story, everybody acted well, still go watch it. Every frame (well almost!) enchanting. And going slow, enough time take every detail. Yes, movie fairy tale narrated such. Melodrama used parent would use exaggerated voice modulation narrate story. But, I still wouldn't call children's movie. It unlikely hues, pace, subtle sense humor going retain child's attention. On hand, short movie perfect way would introduce art cinema children! And yes parents, moral end story. The camerawork, indoors outdoors, simply breathtaking. Himachal Pradesh's tourism department could well use scenes advertise scenic beauty. Though interiors largely shot dark, lighting colors used beautify scenes perfection. A scenes shot point view character object, allowing see they/it seeing - camera combination background score used enhance emotion sought created (read "what worked" section). There frames outright ugly, almost felt like shot different camera crew altogether. But, while, I noticed shots used specifically darker characters. Maybe wasn't intentional, viewer feels obligated rationalize things don't like, director done job well, right? The simple story complemented simple music soft ears. The lyrics appropriately followed child's train thoughts. Reminded lot Gulzar's 'lakdi ki kaathi' Masoom - song I grew listening to. The lyrics especially stood umbrella, inanimate object, spoken lover. What stuck sore thumb acting side characters. In fact, little girl's performance also mark. It lifeless flat. Pankaj Kapoor however, made brilliant body language. And movie artistic representation subject, individual performance. Though, movie characters, character driven script. Here I go rationalizing again! This movie much trip fantasy land experiment medium creative use camera, lighting, music color. A work art rarely made available common movie-going population. So, catch still theaters, DVD might full justice overall effort.
