Nitin Desai seems enjoy proverbial fish water. Following acting debut last year, celebrated art director’s debut feature helm, Ajintha, hit theatres week. Ambitious scale vision, Ajintha technique going it, falls way short even halfway decent watch, primarily writing direction. The film opens jungles Ajintha, Captain James Smith British Army, accompanied team tribals, makes important discovery – caves two millennia old, containing carvings paintings depicting various incarnations Lord Buddha. Keen promoting discovery, British decide send soldier, also happens skill paintbrush, recreate paintings sculptures, exhibited caves popularized. Thus, Captain Robert Gill arrives easel canvas caves Ajintha, create version masterpieces. With beauty new environment comes Paro, tribal girl sad past, capturing imagination innocence, becoming muse source creativity. There denying premise film lot scope. Unfortunately, unforgivably incoherent screenplay combined rather weak directorial hand causes result clumsy, pointless boring. The dialogue film especially clunky, lot unintentionally causing large section audience guffaw uncontrollably. In fact, one large stretch middle audience made feel like I watching Vicky Donor again, even though nothing remotely funny going on, screen. Nitin Desai’s wish make film indulgent ‘arty’, thing, clearly shows - long circular trolley shots around characters bring forth mental turmoil; thin lines dreams reality large sets seem exist one moment disappear next; attempts bathe characters shafts light; works. Ajintha virtually case study fact even decades celebrated technician associated best films filmmakers country doesn’t necessarily give ability direct film. If someone brings forth shred credibility film, young British actor Philip Scott Wallace, plays Robert Gill. In spite saddled ungainly English dialogue, seems invested character soldier artistic leanings, falls love Indian tribal girl. Sonalee Kulkarni, actress plays Paro, different matter altogether. Not particularly good acting, doesn’t even come close looking like one would imagine rustic, wild tribal beauty look like. The problems Ajintha, then, pretty elementary really. The film graph, moments hook you, real takeaway. Apart well-designed constructed sets, beautiful frames intriguing background music, Ajintha little going make mark either critically commercially. This one safely given miss.
