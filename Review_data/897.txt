The moment characters film begin reacting everything yelling top voices, I'm put off. Invariably, insistent background music accompaniment too. Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya hits nail spot. That besides, nothing much going terms story logic. Well, nothing logical strong-headed woman mind knows wants able avoid marriage till finds right guy. At basic level, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya fails. But, I guess, could give them, trying end. It's miraculous entire film seems revolve around Minnie (Genelia D'Souza (Deshmukh(?))) yet ultimately man film, Viren (Riteish Deshmukh) show wears pants. Of course, climax something given on, first time used film. But, oh well, fair love, war Bolly-com - audience come terms with. The thing going film then, lead pair - Riteish Deshmukh Genelia D'Souza. Genelia D'Souza doubt pretty one could alternate glinting eyes charming smile couple hours. You'd enjoy even distracted exaggerated hand-gestures shrill voice, like me. And actually like kind body language dialogue delivery, I wouldn't even venture much it'd mean you. But, I tire easily over-enthusiastic characters, real life too, we've seen much recent times, anyway. Riteish Deshmukh hand plays perfect lad-in-distress - helpless, clueless yet surprisingly sure wants life. Yet, many time, want act normal see works you. The rest cast loud bunch, 2-3 glimpses subtle understanding see Om Puri come surprise. They remind capable of. Unfortunately, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya caught exuberant funny injustice 'message' wants send. Even so, underlying motivation come across, pleasant surprise wish more. That problem Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya. It tried hard keep smile face. Fine, I enjoy moments, others got annoying. And, anyway, ultimately boy-meets-girl story meat it.
