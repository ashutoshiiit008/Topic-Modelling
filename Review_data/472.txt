The definition comedy seen immense makeover since Shakespeare days. There’s slapstick comedy, satire, black comedy even rom-com. Similarly, there’s also Haha-funny, Lol-funny I’d like called ‘witty-repartee’ funny. But films coin meaning funny. Janis John one film, translates sense humour entire movie. There’s name it, it’s simple film really funny situation. Period. Janis John set France around Insurance salesman Pablo Sterni, (Sergi Lopez) schemes dupe drug-addicted cousin 500,000 francs: arranging second coming Janis Joplin John Lennon. It’s crazy synopsis, first half film, constitutes set-up fraud, equally crazy. The humour tone film lies craziness. As viewer wonder, world going work out? The two actors playing fake John Lennon (Francois Cluzet playing failed actor) Janis Joplin (Marie Trintignant, also Sterni’s wife) remarkably aloof beginning. The film graphs con journey whirlpool situations find in. The fanatic cousin, Leon’s (Christopher Lambert) sheer reason existence return two rock idols. He’d looking forward since (allegedly) met restroom, happened promise would return. The first time Janis John reach record shop, get glimpse fanaticism. We’ve seen behavior - young teenagers shouting screaming around rock stars, girls fainting sight idol, madness. However, idea fanaticism dealt slightly differently film. Leon’s record shop everything replica revolver killed Lennon Joplin’s favorite Whiskey, Southern Comfort. He seems like somber fan, reality actions tell fanaticism mania - kind could pose serious trouble. The rest film one interesting incident another. Cluzet Trintignant absolutely hilarious film, mission celebrities. The star film certainly Marie Trintignant, transforms meek housewife fake Janis Joplin- it’s transformation shock you. Unfortunately, Trintignant passed away unfortunate accident shooting film. Towards end film, director Samuel Benchetrit, also Marie’s huband, included many slow, close shots - posing silent tribute. The DVD special features, apart small 10-minute compilation uncut scenes. They mostly show Marie Cluzet trying perform Lennon Joplic songs failing miserably. The scenes graph struggle like rock icons, honestly cannot replaced. This reason film amusing. Dialogues performances apart, film funny it’s simple account highly implausible situation.
