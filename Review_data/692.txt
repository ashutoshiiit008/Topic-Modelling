Like not, true. Dabangg one influential films contemporary Hindi cinema. It has, fist-thumping, water-hose twirling way, defined kind films subjected days. Unfortunately, Dabangg endure ignominy clubbed films attempted cash hysteria. So people always say Dabangg, Ready Bodyguard breath, even though Dabangg much tripe followed it. The film even managed buck recent trend South Indian films remade Hindi, inspiring Tamil remake. Osthe, starring Silambarasan (Simbu) lead role, stays faithful source frame-by-frame, much even gets bicep-flexing baddie Sonu Sood reprise role. For multitude reasons however, Osthe falls way short Dabangg. The superficial reasons plenty. Dabangg’s Chhedi Singh becomes Osthe’s Boxer Daniel. (Yes, really!) Malaika’s Munni becomes Mallika’s I don’t know what. The dialogue writer repeatedly invokes Rajnikanth’s Sivaji The Boss, say Osthe - The Mass. (I’m still rubbing eyes disbelief one.) Surprisingly, Osthe nowhere near Dabangg even technical department. The action isn’t nearly well executed, VFX look mediocre places. Also, action sequences poorly cut. The songs, though, extremely catchy, especially title track. However, certain naughty innocence soundtrack Dabangg Osthe doesn’t manage recreate. Needless say, I don’t even remember tune Mallika Sherawat’s item song. And Salman Khan. Make mistake, Simbu (or ‘Young Superstar STR’, believe opening credits Osthe) endearing hell. He style, dances well, athletic, charm hard ignore. But whole wide world match Salman Khan’s blazing screen presence, especially film like Dabangg, Salman seems time life. Even sentence ‘Simbu’s shirt gets ripped end’ sounds like someone trying make Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus Lego. As I said though, merely superficial differences. (Yes, even Salman Khan.) The reasons Dabangg works Osthe doesn’t lie far deeper. Dabangg isn’t great cinema, doubt. However, Abhinav Singh Kashyap never pretended making. The makers film reveled ridiculousness played screen, rendering popcorn passé celebrating chana jor garam instead. In process, Dabangg also captured wonderful flavor Hindi heartland. Try watching Dabangg without looking central characters action, you’ll know I mean. It may seem first sight, Dabangg well truly ‘different’. Osthe, hand, follows long line similar films coming Tamil Nadu since time immemorial. Punch lines, style, action, catchy songs real plot – elements new Tamil cinema; make films sleep. When wake up, get Vinnaithandi Varuvaya, Alaipayuthey, Anbe Sivam likes. Simply put, Dabangg will, right wrong, always remembered, Osthe fall wayside. The thing remotely comparable two films fact Osthe’s lead actress Richa Gangopadhyay inconsequential film Sonakshi Sinha was. One wonders director S. Dharani producers film didn’t realize making hackneyed; matter much proclaimed lead actor superstar, way could make film memorable actually attempt push envelope, something different. Ultimately boils simple fact Chulbul Pandey character won’t forgotten hurry. Osthe Velan, hand, bound fall wayside.
