I’ve often wondered whether writers know power bestowed with. As bearer fiction, could make characters dance around naked pass literary. It fascinating me, I always wanted write book I, presumed author, would live conversation characters, talking feel part book. You know, almost like really cool making of. Although, I guess Marc Forster beat Stranger Than Fiction. Stranger Than Fiction one subtle movies blow away don’t even realize it. It’s revolves around Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), meticulous auditor leads predictably disciplined life. Crick’s wrist watch life; timing every second day. The film grips right beginning when, coupled quirky graphics, learn head works. Numbers, road maps calculations surround plays life us. With background music support introduction, it’s one finest beginnings film would witness. You’re brought movie calm narration, realize it’s narration Crick hear. His life turns upside hear woman narrate life (not predict almost happens him). He consults psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) refers Literature professor, Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), able help text narration. To me, entire sub-plot film one deductive interpretations consumption literature (I’m including Charlie Kaufman’s Adaptation too). Hoffman deconstructs text core – trying analyze it’s genre studying archetypes; whether it’s comedy tragedy (much like film us viewers – amused premise tragically trying ignore existentialist question film poses.) Interspersed story Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), writer doesn’t know put end new novel. She’s sent assistant help keep deadlines (Queen Latifah, whose talented extremely wasted unnecessary film) – realizes, course film, power story meets Harold. Harold also meets Ana Pascal, motor-mouth, tattooed Bakery owner hates kind – “taxmen”. They develop endearing relationship starts conflict hate moves onto path discovery. The growth relationship Ana periodical meetings Professor Hilbert brings film together savory, indulgent manner. You barely phenomenally understated premise – you’re provided backdrop edgy, charming characters twisted relationships. Together make Stranger Than Fiction alluring film. The Blu-Ray edition Stranger Than Fiction packed extras. The first entertaining one audio commentary Hoffman, Forster Will Ferrell– it’s funny goofy provides welcome breather stimulating movie. This attitude present 6 featurettes talk casting making film. The disk also 9 deleted scenes, mostly Crick’s visits therapist. For die-hard fans movie (which I become writing it), it’s DVD must possess. Stranger Than Fiction kind film makes realize brilliantly crafted afterthought. The kind make go, “Wait minute...” you’ll rethink film head. It’s process you’ll want butt Crick’s narration, help out, make deductions text, suggest possible endings Eiffel’s book. Most importantly, slapped recurring existentialist question film posing, want answer you’ll smile film hasn’t attempted either.
