If missing vowel ‘Ajay Devgn’ puzzling you, must know company’s name Ajay Devgn Ffilms. Yes, double-F ‘ffilms’ typo. Clearly, ffilm people seem assume India’s collective IQ dives far south festive season. While may entirely false, I sure least logic laws physics tad bit universal buffoonery big, festive releases subject us to. Mildly amusing best capable inducing seizures worst, Son Sardaar kind film exhaust synonyms word ‘silly’ come grinning, proud existence reasons discerning amongst us find difficult fathom. The plot (I’m mighty generous using word film) something generations-old bloodthirsty family feud kept Jassi (our hero, Ajay Devgn) last surviving member Randhawa clan, away India 25 years. He returns stake claim ancestral land, blissfully unaware may longer hold grudges, arrival long-awaited Sandhu clan, led Balvinder Singh Sandhu aka Billu, played Sanjay Dutt. You see, Billu walked wedding 25 years back, swearing kill every last member Randhawas gets married. If plot seems old hills, treatment is, expectedly, juvenile get. I must confess I even begin think sheer volume braindead-ery film contains, I feel like I’m obsessive-compulsive maniac, clearly audience kind film. I refuse believe, however, exaggerated action comedy must necessarily entail treat like don’t brain two-and-a-half hours life. Not surprisingly, stereotypical jokes intellect Sikhs abound film. In fact, whole film set village full dunderheads, Sikh. I often wondered point film show anyone living Punjab uses brain sparingly people behind film. For film comedy one two primary ‘pillars’, jokes mainly banal, lent credibility sporadically actors delivering lines aren’t half bad. The film’s supposed pillar action, also one weakest bits. Apart fact don’t seem feel even slightly original visionary, execution tacky. CG-generated fake skies don’t help way. If people find film even slightly watchable, actors. Ajay Devgn goofy endearing; Sanjay Dutt frightening yet charming air Sonakshi Sinha, seems want films look like they’ll make ridiculous ‘club’ you-know-how-many crores, actually passably pleasant bits don’t require pretend like dancing gay abandon. Mukul Dev, fresh cold storage, couple silly lines work quite well. The pick cast, though, Juhi Chawla, seems sensible character village-with-no-IQ. This Diwali, Son Sardaar clearly greater two evils, though doubt film going entertain audience smaller centers hilt. For people liked Rowdy Rathore, Bodyguard likes, congratulations – chances you’ll like one too. For others, I think I made point amply clear.
