It amazing much ground covered slow pace less two hours. More movie-makers need learn trick. And lot style. But, thriller, fails. There major twists plot, given situation know exactly said character going react. And last scene painfully silly. However, technical aspects like action stunts, cinematography, camera movements interest you; certainly worth watch. The unique treatment titles grabs attention. The first 15-20 minutes raise curiosity I call ‘over-produced’ - dramatic entries characters, much background music, urge something “different” every frame shows. The actual story unfolds gradually interval thinking, “it’s okay far, let’s see goes”. And come dialogues repeated impact - okay, I exaggerating - one dialogue repeated…but, thrice. To credit though, me, whole auditorium gave exasperated “ohhh”, third time. And word “dharm” heard one many times. The unique characteristics Amitabh Bachchan’s character repeated till learn heart. And comes climax I said almost blurted out, “You gotta kidding me! The maker Parinda 1942 – A love story ended movie like this?!” The performances awesome. Once again, forget Amitabh Bachchan screen. He looks feels character. The screen presence scenes, standing without single line deliver, amazing. Everyone else done job perfection too. But, I want watch recent movie Amitabh Bachchan serious role, I would watch second half Babul again. If I want watch Saif Ali Khan angry character I would rather watch Omkara again. Sanjay Dutt, obviously well comic relief, I want laugh him, I watch Lage Raho Munnabhai again. Ditto Vidya Balan, full grace, takes care mandatory romantic angle. The flaws screenplay many end distracting visual treat. Same story lot detailing Vidhu Vinod Chopra ten years ago - might better experience.
