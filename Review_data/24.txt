There dearth morons world, clearly, whole genre films tries show much fun laugh moron’s expense. 21 & Over fair share moronic characters, consistently unfunny film packed gags outdated time last century. An exhausting comedy tries best channel similar films genre – The Hangover, Superbad, American Pie likes – failing quite miserably, 21 & Over kind film makes 93 minutes seem like eternity. Surprisingly enough, film written debut directorial effort writers The Hangover, Jon Lucas Scott Moore. Jeff Chang turned 21, oldest buddies - obnoxiously in-your-face Miller nerdy aspiring-Wall-Street-guy Casey – land doorstep years touch, take pub-hopping generally show good time. Except Jeff Chang career-defining interview next morning, father absolutely mood let anything would jeopardize interview career. Not anything going stop Jeff Chang’s friends, Miller particular, way. Then begins night migraine-inducing silliness never seems end. Apart moments film can’t help amused by, film clearly trying hard. True, Miles Teller, Skylar Astin Justin Chon - play Miller, Casey Jeff Chang respectively – manage keep energy levels consistently high. But much enthusiastic cast do, writer-directors finding hard rise banality. The film primarily relies stereotypes racism funny, booze, puke nudity second line attack. Unsurprisingly, none works. Packing proceedings everything, irritable group jocks, annoying sorority girls, hairy, semi-nude, self-proclaimed Master something I don’t remember, nut-job wearing Indian chief’s headdress, film tests patience throughout. And feeble attempt coming-of-age story well, film tries tell follow heart makes happy, film manages lose plot never first place. One would think hour half isn’t much take, believe me, film feels way longer that. It doesn’t help even technically, film quite weak. It all-too-generic look choppy editing, though I strongly suspect abrupt cuts suggested Indian censors. Fact remains poor film, weak technique stands even more, something film suffers well. Predictable, asinine always puerile, 21 & Over truly film doesn’t need watched. For silliness invokes genuine laughs, I’d suggest revisit The Hangover DVD instead.
