"How it?" A question every magician takes pride answering. Of course, Dhoom 3's magician, Saahir (Aamir Khan) asked too, audience peaked interest half-heartedly. Mainly It tad predictable despite indigestible. Two things movie I little patience - predictability implausibility. But, again, Dhoom 3 Abhishek Bachchan Uday Chopra trying pull Rajni-style stunts. How much meta unbelievability get? To credit best bringing laughter, whether well-meant matter 'to own'. I feel like observing two minute silence mourning I saw Uday Chopra get better role comic relief Abhishek Bachchan sidekick. Oh well. But again, Aamir Khan around every one sidekick. So, Aamir Khan bit intense look persistently face first half film. It annoying, I walked expecting that. But pleasantly, shifts gears second half actually pulls role cleverly. That leaves Ms. Kaif start "Indian Goddess song dance" thing. It happen role little that. Just enough feminist say, "she used prop." Even so, performance doesn't require great emotion. Anyway, place emotion action flick, superficial. And superficially infused is, romance, dedication son father, revenge - seem fillers movie really meant - action. The action sequences shoddy, pretty neat, inspired something seen elsewhere. Yet, us haven't seen many action films, bits new experience. Similarly, story new experience anyone seen The Prestige. And people comparison equivalent blasphemy - Ghajini [Memento}(http://wogma.com/article/my-favorite-movies/ "Memento Review"), Dhoom 3 The Prestige. I don't understand audience expected look fact Dhoom 3 nothing 3 hour long chase sequence enough thrills. To add fuel fire, makers thought important repeated slo-mo effect. Sigh. And yet, I wouldn't surprised Dhoom 3 finds share takers more. sigh
