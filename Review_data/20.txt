My usual problem horror films made Bhatt fashion seems underlying theme revenge. Given that, story predictable - good vs evil spirit. Scary faces noises scaring daylights badly made women, loophole hocus-pocus ta-da evilness spirit taken care of. With 1920 Evil Returns, revenge per se, premise spirit evil lame revenge looks like least plausible reason nastiness. The buildup towards mystery might cause Smriti's (Tia Bajpai) situation slow relaxed. While mystical way done alright, crumbles within minutes voiceover reading letter, unengaging fashion. And like one would expect, writers don't seem care causes spirit cause much harm, long get write contorted imagery haunting spirit. The imagery though brought well combination Tia Bajpai, special effects team make-up artists. Aftab Shivdasani appropriately restrained confused, thus expressionless Vidya Malavade extremely superficial expressing herself. Tia Bajpai hand, must exhausted mentally, physically maybe even emotionally scenes character possessed. But then, possessed, Tia's dialogue delivery annoyingly honey-coated. So much wished parts possessed back, least feel sorry her. Anyway, person likes thrill provided horror, last half hour 1920 Evil Returns might well worth time spent film. To disgusting kind gory. However, I like basic concept evil spirit taking advantage body's sudden death means uses express much hatred feels inside. But little late. Those concepts actually explored another story. I also liked possessed clear right beginning time spent building aspect standard evil-spirit horror film. But, writers got lazy wrote turn events brought everything back square one. Such shame, again. Creaking doors, background music builds climaxes, extra sweet, innocent lady possessed evil spirit won't let go - yep many standard ingredients horror film trying hard scare. It doesn't really scare, get repulsive parts.
