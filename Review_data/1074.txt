The novelty Yeh Khula Aasmaan grandfather-grandson relationship. The rest mix inspiring 'quotable quotes' worth worth typical underdog sports story. Behind emphasis pressurizing child score academically thick layer pressure succeed whatever chosen him. And didn't work me. However, one take away Yeh Khula Aasman brilliant performance Raghuvir Yadav. Whether I agree Raghuvir Yadav's character do, performance warm endearing. So debutant Raj Tondon's performance - comes across perfect representative confused, diffident, complex age called adolescence. The rest cast actually functional thus caricaturish. Only two seem real emotions. In sense then, real emotion relationship about. That I found far ideal different matter. While Ye Khula Aasmaan looks upon parents tendency put children way bring sense responsibility, adds burden bearing grandparent's aspirations. This boils child live someone others' expectations. What good do? So, simple medium kite-fight used signify larger thing called life. The metaphor used beautifully one song, beyond becomes bit much I could see need Avinash (Raj Tondon) succeed. This brings question, happens people don't succeed? There people haven't ever succeeded anything did. What happens them? Or might story worth making film there. There indeed 'loser' protagonists succeeded story film. I won't say route Yeh Khula Aasmaan takes, one you'll figure movie progresses. But, I tell Yeh Khula Aasmaan complete loss Raghuvir Yadav, Raj Tondon chemistry create. The preachy dialogue worked bit within relationship grandfather grandson. You could see fall apart soon Avinash's friends began saying lines meant inspire. Yeh Khula Aasman lovely, warm, genuine moments camaraderie grandparent grandchild hard work writing heartfelt performances protagonists. Unfortunately, beats purpose exactly pointed figure start with.
