If I get bored mind watching films again, don't makers get bored making again. Maybe, it's team/person doesn't make many I watch. Fortunately. Khiladi 786 yet another one painfully non-sensical, supposedly comic ones you'd hesitate calling film. Khiladi 786 actually makes easy viewer rip apart. Every department awful job could begin anywhere criticize would right place start. From action editing music acting dialogue choreography - want tear-your-hair-apart, since can't end cringing. So much I confident I could say thing story effort write tell one. Do fooled initial set-up fake, macho police officer plays Robin Hood wants woman woo (Akshay Kumar); mafia-leader called Tendulkar (Mithun Chakraborty) sister (Asin) wants wed off; want-to-be match-maker (Himesh Reshammiya). A couple lies later, know writers thought that's that's needed make full length feature film. Can really blame music director/singer turned actor turned writer know develop idea enjoyable story? Not idea great start with, barely tolerate music director. And I want erase memory Himesh Reshammiya trying mimic going double nasal song sang Akshay Kumar. In addition, attempt comic timing pulling faces draw laughter audience reminds school plays. Also, shouldn't criminal offense create tune annoying gets stuck head? I'm talking 'khiladi bhaiyya, khiladi bhaiyya, khilaaadhi' repeated often enough film get nerves shamelessly flaunts existence out! Anyway, it's shame see Mithun Chakravorty Raj Babbar pithy, meaningless roles. Even kind Gunda references former. And actually, it's shame see even Akshay Kumar put one. Asin gets play same-old loud-mouth, brash woman. No creativity whatsoever there. A lot fun supposed 'action' action comedies. And usually, I complain camera action instead actors stunt doubles. But, funnily enough, 72 Singh aka Khiladi 786 aka Akshay Kumar Speedy Singh. Which means moves fast cannot see him. And guess what? Shoddy editing used make things go missing 'show' action. It outright insulting, patronizing frustrating - once. Which pretty much summarizes Khiladi 786 - insulting, patronizing frustrating.
