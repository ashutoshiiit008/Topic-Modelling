Jodi Breakers right mix ups & downs, moments - insecure & 'aawww', comedy, define relationship. Unfortunately, spends energy getting one next makes whole story look functional rather involved connected. Similarly, actors look like keeping one-arm distance characters. Except one moment, R Madhavan looked like trying justify decision cast him, looked extremely uncomfortable opposite Bipasha Basu. And despite fact looked comfortable non-hero-like body story used well too. One could call restrained performance, Bipasha Basu, didn't look like wanted go way emote. And yes, I'm one believe can. As natural outcome then, 'chemistry' forcing invoke looked mighty unnatural. Not anything natural basic plot line - Sid (R Madhavan) makes business separating couples aren't getting along well other. And separate - hook crook. Therefore, manipulative mind inevitable takes liking Sonali (Bipasha Basu) even better coming manipulative ideas kill relationship. When I first saw trailer Jodi Breakers, I assumed least portion film would spent creatively twosome break marriages apart. But, nothing sort, one two cases shown tiny bit detail outrageous. In fact, aren't creative type reasons couples want break either. It's either cheating mother-in-law. That's it. The second half film isn't even breaking-up bit. It almost second film another story center, except carrying minimal baggage first half. In 30+ years watching films, I've never able understand easily people fall love willingly characters forgive others wronged unimaginable way possible. Jodi Breakers another film added list question marks. But, I guess, expected good cine-goer forgive them. Oh, like characters! Aah... Yet, moments second half looked like they'd evoke emotion me. But, remained half-hearted, half-baked. And it's sad romantic film cannot stir you. Same goes comedy parts well. Except couple well-timed one-liners Omi Vaidya R Madhavan, film barely kept smiling. I guess I thankful I didn't cringe much. On note, let's bid adieu another rom-com misses mark mile.
