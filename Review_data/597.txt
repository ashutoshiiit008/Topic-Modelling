If look closely, find tiny line half scene involves Main Tera Hero's hero, Seenu (Varun Dhawan) actual hero - empowers Sunaina (Ileana D'cruz) stand herself. A couple tiny needles I found haystack couple glimpses great comic timing Ileana D'Cruz, Saurabh Shukla Arunoday Singh. That Main Tera Hero. The rest is, film fooling believing funny garb mindless comedy. However, Main Tera Hero makes pretensions interest taking anything seriously. So, Seenu move randomly small town Bangalore take mean cop (Arunoday Singh) obsessed manically possessive girl love with, Sunaina (Ileana D'Cruz), course man Seenu falls love first sight. Only twist comes conveniently half-mark, stopped caring long time ago. Yeah, Main Tera Hoon kind film. I would complained women mercy silly games men play game, I know right title film. The attempt comedy really laughable - certainly, good way. Its old tricks would found David Dhawan film couple decades ago - slaps, contrived situations get worse minute. You hit palm forehead stop wondering comes stuff like this. Yet, I must admit Main Tera Hero much focus plot average David Dhawan film. So much that, Shakti Kapoor's subplot seems like afterthought - oops, focused central plot standards. That thought film falling short terms runtime. Either case, eyesore. The performances belong slapstick film. Varun Dhawan monkeys around, Nargis Fakhri adequately continues annoy, Anupam Kher makes fool yet again. Like I said earlier, Ileana D'Cruz, Saurabh Shukla Arunoday Singh manage laugh two, about. What boggles mind - 8.30AM show full house seemed next one I walked film. What cute despairing group cinema hall laughing loud fun. Sometimes, I wish I could that.
