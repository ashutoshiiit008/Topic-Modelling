When film over-the-top situations exaggerated, I tend look spoof it; underlying comment; cynicism. And course, left imagination, ain't difficult find either. But, Khichdi crass, even I laughed, I felt yucky inside. It's toilet-humor kind crass. It's absolutely (hopefully-miles-away-from-reality) insensitive crass. I guess, it's way saying nothing worth taking seriously - neither deaths funerals weddings; certainly respect older generation let alone human. And it, vogue days, potshot media education system too. As darker joke, harder writers laughing seriously treat issue real life. And thus, find social philosophical commentary almost everything - asking creator universe scarcity water, human's love creating problems - lot ground covered. And using juvenile humor better known PJs (poor jokes appropriately lame pun jokes). My affinity humor obvious. In real-life audience, equally greeted eye-roll eye-roll. Yet I appreciated fluidity situations. A film like could easily episodic. Even expensive 'comedy' films India episodic. But, Khichdi least semblance cause giving rise effect, rather backward calculation. Also, given genre, I guess lot actors fine job looking camera acting! My palm stuck forehead scene characters giving acting lessons. Aaaye-aaye-aaye-aay-aay. What become universe? Someone please tell me, Khichdi's huge following TV analogical poor joke.
