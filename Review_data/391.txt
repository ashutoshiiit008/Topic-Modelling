Every horror film review "I HATE horror films" disclaimer. I can't handle creepy, crawling feeling well-made horror film creates sustains length film. And film well-made, well... Haunted scares work timing rest time either laughing questioning logic puts in. How blamed wondering spirit struggling doors walls times, freely moves room room even city city without trouble. Yep, it's kind film. The super-slow start builds zero suspense, predict door going creak book going fall light going flicker. And goes on, slow pace. It's surprising then, towards climax, even though I knew film going likely end patience worn four times over, I felt protagonists I wanted spirit die. And I think mostly due performances. While Mahakshay pretty much one expression hold, fine. Tia Bajpai made feel especially rape scenes. Enough control damage caused voice non-horrified scenes. The make-up spirits background music goes enough scare times do. All would acceptable story anything new offer. No, "spirit" experts illuminating us ridiculous ways evil works, count. Same old troubled spirit haunting house reaches unsuspecting visitor decades, human body lived dies. Same old ways spirit conquered. It's little form entertainment (even creepy/crawly kind). It matters little 3D technology used completely wasted.
