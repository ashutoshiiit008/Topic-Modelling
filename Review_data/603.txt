Did know Marigold name flower? You did? Oh well, tough luck - movie you, interesting thing come with. Yeah, it’s drab. If plot graph level interest movie 100 odd minutes' run-time, first hour would pretty flat close axis. By time, Prem's ever-smiley character shows uncharacteristically different shade - pretty much don't care direction graph headed. Its exasperating four stories try unfold nowhere last 40 minutes. I relieved leave theater vertical drop last 10 minutes run nearest available paracetamol. They done something pep script up, considering acting pretty much going flat top. Oh right! Music supposed solution problem - break monotony. In director's words, "Music, course, key part story MARIGOLD". Excuse me, director sahib – story? Unfortunately, music serve purpose. Music Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's movies used lot played pubs rickshaws. These older numbers much entertaining originals one. One thing I looking forward to, watching promotional trailers, visuals songs. Yep, flat too!! One thing dull though, animation used transitions (they editor, see). They bright, colorful well, extremely out-of-place kitschy. There attempt labeling Marigold Hollywood's spoof marriage Bollywood, something like that. Guys, let's fix first things first - let's try make cinema first maybe talk from, take digs whom. Or they, name Bollywood-like, trying give excuses innumerable problems script? By way, readers, I tried sound clichéd stereotypical avoiding following words - cliché, stereotypical, repetitive, yikes, eeeewww, Oh Gawd ... get general idea, right?
