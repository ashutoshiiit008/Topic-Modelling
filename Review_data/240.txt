This perfect example one department movie, done well, cannot take movie home. Deadline really good performances. Konkana Sen Sharma’s act looks effortlessly done. Her character looks natural viewer forgets fact acting. Irrfan Khan yet another grim role remarkable control. His diction dialogue delivery good ever. Personally, I would like see play lighter character, gets typecast parts. Rajit Kapoor Zakir Hussain bit apt amount energy. Sandhya Mridul though, could done little constraint, expressions make-up tad exaggerated. The story execution culprits. The main pre-requisite movie genre missing audience guess story going first half hour. The whole experience becomes agonizingly anti-climatic. If high point movie comes first quarter, things would given cinematic license otherwise, become less tolerable - extra background score, weird camera movement, crooked smirks say, “I know better thee”. Then usual list things plain annoying - product placement, melodramatic pauses lines, obvious loopholes story. The good thing movie short unnecessary sub-plots. Same set actors, similar story, may-be even director, different screenplay could made movie much watchable.
