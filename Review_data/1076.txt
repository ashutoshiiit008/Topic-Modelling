Yeh Faasley's first hour one you'd want walk theater. Like badly made B-grade film. The excessively grainy texture doesn't add fun either. It way distracting. But then, actual plot starts unfolding man thrilling ride! It's surprises; psychological element story carries one mind-bending process. In fact, one example even straightforward, linear narrative take fair share brainpower. After leaving theater, go back forth Dev (Anupam Kher) behaved way did. It also adds insight Arunima (Tena Desae) thinks father killed mother would still want bond dad. Like anyone love, wants hold last thread hope, keep hating father loved. "Why kill her? Is man thinks is? Was love them? Did kill all?" These questions Arunima pulls into, half-ready leave theater. You didn't respect Anupam Kher. And doesn't let down, know could done much scene breaks down. Instead, plain voiceover narrating emotions. Such shame. These decisions director take complete blame. Also, courtroom drama ...actually can't called drama rather blah considering smartly subtly psychological part plot played out. The screenplay also doesn't support story terms consistent pace. The set-up boring takes much screen-time. The actual action starts much later little time play out. Yeh Faasley's story core beyond awesome. I'd loved see different director another screenplay writer would done it. Oh well, least didn't mess way turns end. The psychological nuances motivations explain everything. Off late, movie I've started like point, I dread climax - invariably butchered awful writing climax commercial needs. Yeh Faasley way round. The climax perfect!
