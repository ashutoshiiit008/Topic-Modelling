I still processing film. An hour I left cinema hall, I relishing experience understood film completely. Oh, lovely feeling mulling lingering after-taste film. Despite issues - issues I'd held grudge against, another context. Context - isRaanjhanaa's biggest strength. Not Benares loafers woo girls two ways, college politics, also differences characters play differences. Of course, there's music adds lovely texture milieu Benares Delhi. In fact, first hour plays like musical. But things unlike Hindi films work forRaanjhanaa - like two protagonists couple side characters sketched well, intriguing lovely shades gray. In fact, main leads gray lead character gets Hindi films. In first lines itself, Kundan (Dhanush) accepts apprehensions trailers - "good-looking" - matter-of-fact tone. From thinking Kundan loser wooing girl way league - Zoya (Sonam Kapoor), unknowingly start warming him. And even like him, sure deserves woman smarter, better-looking, etc him. On hand, sure, Zoya good either. She thick shade gray. Yet, Sonam Kapoor charming screen presence accept anything not-white her. Yet conveys ambiguity character's intentions throughout. That could pretty much maintains expression film. There moments feel Zoya's pain confusion, times want scoff games, soon back ambiguous expression. This time let slide seem intentional. There something actor makes want give another chance. Dhanush hand, comes across simple lad simple intentions character Kundan. There times slips South Indian accent bit conveniently covered making South Indian Pandit Benares. Yes, yes, I know South Indian priests Benares, darn good coincidence. But, intentionally converts liking character even though start distinct dislike, underdog. Other broad stroke true love one allows oneself go one believes love, underlying currents. Of course, entire angle political unrest dissatisfied section youth trying can. That subtly put neat little satirical scene. The one layer I particularly enjoyed irony boy stalking girl town film college students street-plays eve-teasing. The girl plays around sentiments boy love participates plays talk women taken advantage women. These little things bring smile. As many quips. While one-liners bring house laughter others sound cheesy yet manage make smile. And comes last 15-20 minutes leave confused. The first two hours done enough good let last bit cause much damage. In fact, I enjoyed air mystery. Characters behave out-of-character yet actions don't take completely surprise. And I'm complaining creating space sequel, though I'd apprehensions like I would sequel. Yet, cannot shake feeling feels incomplete even rushed. It make wonder writers couldn't think appropriate copped leaving unsaid. That's Raanjhanaa you, leaving lot mixed feelings, good way.
