Different story, different issue, different aesthetics, different acting lead actors - film deserves applause this. Now it's different story doesn't completely connect make care characters let alone issue hand. A lot seems missing despite looks like best efforts. I'm asking complete coverage events regions facing Naxal protests. Considering Red Alert tries maintain balance two perspectives, asking anything way beyond 2-hour film's purview. I'm complaining pace events unfold. In fact, wonderful depiction unwilling member rebelling faction goes through. How like group, peer pressure makes things he's convinced of. He might seem like 'group idiot' opinion, balanced thought-process withstood brainwashing. And he's brave too. I understand appreciate yet pathos doesn't come through. One could blamed Suneil Shetty's performance 'something missing' feeling, doesn't seem fair. He holds one expression, maybe that's expression character needs. It's something writing portrayal character doesn't completely make root him. This would great reaction gray character, that's true either. The rest characters superficially described. Like every Hindi film, tranformations character arcs far convincing. Given pre-defined changes, acting though, takes pinch away. Kudos Sameera Reddy complete shift image. The rest cast always appreciated accomplishments. I'd say film works documentation times situations live in. Our apathy towards eyes don't see doesn't affect us directly. Our ennui every-day headlines make newspapers. Also, cannot miss comment futility war - even within boundaries one country. And atmosphere story simple man constantly interrogating around rationalizations behavior. Ps. I'll skip notepad section one it's intention making film I'm convinced I cannot make look loopholes script presentation.
