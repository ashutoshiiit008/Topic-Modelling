Director Neil Marshall heavily influenced two important action movies 1980’s; influence becomes obvious moment film starts. One movies George Miller’s low budget Australian film Mad Max, starring unknown Mel Gibson, John Carpenter’s Escape New York. Both movies dealt future, future mankind civilization lie ruins law prevails jungle. Doomsday deals much scenario except minor changes. The heroine woman, Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) obvious reference / tribute Snake Plissken’s character Escape New York, eye patch. The rest plot quite same, additional elements thrown in. So director rework scenario? Well, I must say pretty good job it. For one, take seriously, sure. He looks like fun wonderfully evident campy scene leader Gangs / Punks, Sol, holds audience, literally. There strippers pole routine, group hefty men tartan skirts dance Can Can crowd roars uproariously, climax prisoner roasted alive huge barbecue, Sol shouting much delight audience “We rare treat store tonight! Medium... fucking... rare!” And enough, director sources material another realm fantasy, Arthurian legend, locates nearly one third film realm. There excellent fight sequence, unarmed Eden Sinclair fights huge skulking armored brute violent joust. We given much time think; footage spent establishing character; story cue rolling right start. There back story, quickly dispensed voice frames. The rest film plays one deepest fears human beings; departure zone comfort Unknown zone holds possible terrors. There reflective moments film all, none characters indulge introspection, gives film sort breathless rush. And car chases, involve Bentley Continental GT Speed driven Eden Sinclair. The chase sequences direct tribute Mad Max, even though stunts seen thousand films, makes great enjoyment. We spared gore either; bodies crushed wheels, heads get lopped off, also cleaved fine fashion. Somewhere also message political duplicity public office used one’s ends, brief really matter. Rhona Mitra makes good action heroine, lithe lean, narrow eyed, square jawed look essential playing character. Her face conveys sense vulnerability too, balances tough bleak portrayal. Bob Hoskins makes appearance, Malcolm McDowell. The film offers us nothing new, done good spirit, one finds oneself enjoying whole spectacle, also rooting good guys. PS. An interesting aside character Sol, played Craig Conway. In film Malcolm McDowell’s son. Years ago Malcolm McDowell played character Alex Delarge, vicious sadistic Droog leader Stanley Kubrick’s controversial film, A Clockwork Orange. Craig Conway’s portrayal Sol shades Alex. Like father, like son? (Sol literally means sun, hmm, director indulging bad pun make point!)
