After certain stage relationship, likely, comfort stagnancy. In either case, need extra spark, something look forward to. The apprehension; spring step; glint eye new relationship brings - that's The Lunchbox about. And more. Like relationship, Ila-Fernandes relationship much two individuals relationship itself. Sure, chemistry builds beautifully, without one setting eye other. But, personal insecurities, frustrations makes The Lunchbox stand apart films. Moreover, whole package breathtakingly simple. The one-line plot, characters, ambiance, situations, humor would make even city-bred audience believe middle-class world like exists, much ever did, even today. The one-liner "what if" - well-known lunchbox system went wrong one day put two lonely souls touch other? How fascinating idea! Of thousands possibilities, one writer/director Ritesh Batra picks charmingly old-school gets. The characters picks put together mere faces crowd 20 million. Ordinary, uninteresting - likely, me. The side characters, including neighbor oldie (Bharti Achrekar) don't see, given quirks thoroughly enjoyable, even real. You don't root characters, play along willing go wherever story takes you. There arc. There significant peak story. The simple progress conversations Ila Fernandez enough keep going. Each one special; like conversation budding relationship dear. Yet, none it, thing would've acceptable weren't Irrfan Khan Nimrat Kaur. Let alone slightest show spark disappointment eyes, variation tone voice-overs enough inspire awe. Nawazuddin Siddiqui charmer always. The obvious character film one I biased towards - Mumbai. Any film reminds sights, smells, energy city won first scene. In complete contrast buzzing city is, ever slow-paced, The Lunchbox. A beautiful contrast could get waiting something happen. So, depending make seek films, climax exhilarating underwhelming. I bang between, even though I cannot see fitting end film. That's make break film you.
