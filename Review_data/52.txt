Aashayein stars 50 people whose days numbered fatal disease. Almost come terms it. Some smile artificially. And handful spit venom. How coexist come love Aashayein could about. And I agree, would plain boring base story needed something additional Nagesh Kukunoor platter too. Just spoon-feeding different didn't entirely appeal taste buds. And course went berserk "metaphors" end approached too. Symbolism remains symbolism it's left interpretation. Some parts film feel like 'Metaphor 101' class, teach us, ignorant audience, basics film-reading. It painful see double triple display writer meant showing particular sub-pot, make sure even audience dozing don't miss it. I awe metaphorical stuff started. But rub much charm goes away. Oh and, becomes ridiculous. So, ends making laugh instead making think. Also writer makes things unnecessarily awkward often. Usually, I blame execution uneasiness actors/director felt particular scene. But, writing felt forced could sense hard script go nature make room 'different' situation/action/reaction. A simple thing like hug two characters came across one forced it. It almost felt like writer emotional down. He created world different characters quirks. He digs little deep emotions, panics sees (also panics perception audience's reaction) surfaces breathe. And jagged script becomes pain swallow. And remember pain forget beautiful moments relationships creates. Anyway. There takeaway film. Anaitha Nair, little girl life film. She played blunt, toxic, vulnerable, teenager Padma casually, feel compassion towards wicked character. Exactly supposed feel her. That doesn't mean John Abraham didn't well. It's that, man dying supposed feel sorry him, drool him. Emotions don't particularly show well tries on. But man tries hard, problem effort transparent. A touch humor dialogues, songs, especially lyrics, close-up shots also go "saving grace" list. But... With heavy heart, I say Nagesh Kukunoor doesn't crack Aashayein either. I wouldn't say film starts well. It share clich√©'s, badly written scenes. Like rest film, beginning too, escapes guise calling action/dialogue filmy anyway. But glimpses above-average thought - qualitatively quantitatively - put scenes. There hint soul fate would it, hope dies post interval period starts.
