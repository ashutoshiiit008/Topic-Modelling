Sometimes judge book cover. Pappu Can't Dance Saala offers ounce would expect saw trailer. The problem expect boredom watching trailer. The story good ol' boy-meets-girl dash city-village divide topping opposites-attract. There humor, spark, emotional involvement dreary situations monotonous dialogue given fill details. There's much brilliant actor like Vinay Pathak do. Even though time instead happy-go-luck simpleton, plays angry-irritable simpleton, feels stale. I refuse blame actor yet, film fresh take treatment. Neha Dhupia annoys desired character beginning quickly begins fall flat see absolutely uncivil, inconsiderate character grow heart. Again, can't blame actor. Though casting dancing superstar moreso Rajat Kapoor choreographer laughable. Rajat Kapoor doesn't move much finger name dance film. I mean, thank goodness mercies that, cast all? Don't tell aren't enough people Saurabh Shukla-Vinay Pathak-Rajat Kapoor camp couldn't danced prove character reveled. There couple moments film Vinay Pathak Neha Dhupia endearing, that's little make film worthwhile watch. There also attempt draw balance antagonist misinformed attitudes cities small towns. But first problem order bridge gap, differences shown old stereotypical ways. By time see modern views warming traditional ones traditional ones reciprocate, late. The second problem it's preachy. Similarly, effort taken enlighten men menstrual cycle woes sweet it's in-the-face. It reminded contraception ads 80s one friend would explain concept another. This one way handle didn't work, next time maybe try using sensitivity order sensitize. I liked attempt beginning call ways woman uses fairer-gender card advantage. Using man sees wants treat woman equal thus won't allow gain it, went well character develops later. Only man could see, appreciate accept woman instead see either weak converse characterless. So many meaningful points make yet cigar. Such sad story Pappu inability dance.
