There’s something music bagpipes, isn’t it? Think Mel Gibson’s Braveheart faintly recollect sound. There’s amazing pathos notes produces. Something film like Joyeux Noel (Merry Christmas) plenty. One remarkable features watching Merry Christmas movie on, scenes scream indeed great cinema unfolding front you. I felt first time I watched MAMI Film Festival years ago, film received standing ovation. On DVD, I relived experience - I moved tears, yet many scenes - I also realised film one finest messages peace humanity. Ideally, movie released India. In country J P Dutta’s Border success, Merry Christmas blockbuster material. Based true story, film set Christmas eve first World War, Scottish, German French soldiers Western Front set aside differences declared ceasefire one night celebrate Christmas together. It’s got simple plot, moving screenplay wonderful star-cast makes film watchable. It also one uplifting background scores - plays crucial role conveying soldiers’ emotions. Music, fact plays vital role film - unites soldiers proves matter country you’re from, notes emanating bagpipes mouth organs blur dividing lines. And story sets fantastic example religion - Christianity - acting great unifier, rather divide people. The story also makes strong point European countries’ culture heritage, whose roots less similar. The scale important film understood number languages film touches. There’s English (with heavy Scottish accent), German French. The proximity countries depicted wonderful interludes soldiers - someone knows relative two side, letters passed on, promises made visit war, invitations come drink, compliments passed others' wives witness lump throat, sense may survive battle together. How get back shooting next morning? That’s irony storyline balances sends strong message despite divided man-made borders, humanity essentially simple needs - caring loved ones, wanting families festivals right live good life get decent funeral.
