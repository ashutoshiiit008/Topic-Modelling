I pep talked letting go; jazz life moves death eventual calamity much like jack box – it’s know it. But doesn’t. Because end metaphorical.

They manage carry reminiscent performances every film mould adventure ride feel privileged take them. Each character, loose end tied knot; every sub-plot given due ending – closure senses. This film, unlike others bore pressure matching books, manages leave visual impact, comes pretty close images formed head. If climax played growing pace. Although end film, you’re almost edge know end nearing, still want put time moment. The emotional connect haunting Alexander Despat’s background score like melodies flowing sentences drama, yet end seems like series quick montages.
