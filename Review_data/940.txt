There time long ago American war movies patriotism sacrifice. The last years however contributed lot changing perspective. The noughties began fall Twin Towers ended Rrecession. Somewhere two grand events Bush started infamous Iraq campaign would change way world viewed war. The initial jingoism given way weariness movies focusing man bunker, reasons fighting become meaningless. The Hurt Locker one film, set Iraq telling story elite bomb disposal squad. It much story insecurities commandos lack choices one man -- Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), smokes cigarettes goes disposing explosives like he’s taking walk park. James good, heck he’s brilliant -- tune wires bombs defuse, times even respectful person assembled circuit. He sure himself, times sure doesn’t care wear protective suit! But also reckless, leaving Sanbourn (Anthony Mackie) man charge watching back, unenvious position. So have, Sanbourn complete contrast James, working trying best protect perhaps ulcer. But Hurt Locker isn’t film dwells much contrasts much shows monotony face danger. Director Kathryn Bigelow manages achieve hand-held camera movements, lack background score, superb close-ups narrative style puts heat things. The Hurt Locker sense typical war movie. There aren’t many explosions might wanted definitely many gunfights either. Instead portions movie absolutely nothing happens. There music little visuals. At one point screen goes entirely blank good seconds. The beauty film lies moments. Bigelow manages take right scene action slow pace goes show killing anticipation be. Having said though, also must said The Hurt Locker isn't conventional entertainer make walk theatre say a-ha! It gnaws you, tests patience point want Sanbourn James go home. I might also go extent saying perhaps might also walk theatre feeling somewhat disappointed doesn't fit parameters 'war movie'. But patient enough perhaps little considerate. You might understand sniper lying one position day waiting shoot going through. The director treads line action suspense well. You see things protagonist’s mind see makes does. Sure, James hero film. And lot colleagues probably war hero? But consider one question Bigelow attempts answer. And good job it.
