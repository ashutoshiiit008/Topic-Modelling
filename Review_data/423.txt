Romanticizing beauty old film natural. And Anand (Dev Anand) Meeta (Sadhna) playing mute romance cuteness. Somehow, inexcusable delay dialogue delivery dramatic effect seems cute. You tend discount amateurish portrayal emotions trying transport era. You tend think difficulties makers might gone shoot war scenes, double role, depiction Anand's internal struggle. In fact, admire film reasons. And along makes comment society - taboo associated unwed woman, let alone hint live-in relationship; futility war philosophical question two. kis liye jeete hain hum, kiss-ss ke liye jeete hain? baarahaa aise sawaalaat par rona aaya (what living for? Who living for? Repeatedly, one (the soul/we/I) cries questions these) Those days Sahir Ludhianvi. No metaphor, simile, pun - plain simple poetry makes point. In two lines mocks existential questions. And much ease expresses moment separation lovers even hours. 'abhi na jaao chhod kar...' couple heard song referred it. The playfulness two people love, emotional blackmail, moaning masked all-encompassing word 'LOVE' beautifully set tune Jaidev. adhuri aas chhod ke, adhuri pyaas chhod ke jo roz yunhi jaaoge, kis tarah nibhaoge? ki zindagi ki raah mein, jawaan dilo ki chaah mein kai maqaam aayenge jo hum ko aazmaayenge bura na maano baat ka, ye pyaar hai gila nahi (if leave (me with) incomplete feeling day-after-day going sustain? 'coz love demanding life tests us I say isn't meant hurt, it's complaint, it's love.) Yes, I could go songs Hum Dono. Remember, I haven't even spoken favorites film - 'dukh aur sukh ke raaste...' 'mein zindagi ka saath...'. Who kidding? Take away songs film, Hum Dono would barely known generation. Of course, strong dialogues too, sound way profound pseudo-preachy tone. A line stayed even though rather out-of-context is, "thukraaya hua pyaar kabhi bujhta nahi, dhuaan udta rehta hai" (unrequited love never dies, always comes back haunt you) sound 'blech' film made today. And I think power pure language, SMS-ese, Hinglish. How else could simile burning cigar helpfully letting smoke screen worked? Actually, Hum Dono must "favorites" list. It share screeching violins amplify already melodramatic moments. And twists go far beyond believability. Even believe six faces world similar even believe Anand (Dev Anand) coincidentally lives city soldier platoon look alike Manohar (Dev Anand), happens second half story best, comical. And despite that, showdown women Dev Anand moving. You feel Meeta's (Sadhna) frustration feels wait Anand's return vain Roma (Nanda) touches single-minded devotion husband. Again travelling back time. Today likelihood, would mere laughing stock. But films yore lovely reminder innocence. And I glad I could watch glory. I love watching films theaters. Other obvious reasons - better picture sound quality, general ambience, etc - fact that, film made viewed like attracts cinema hall. So, even though oldies like Hum Dono might play TV, re-releases chance catching big screen. While I wouldn't mind seeing black white versions. But, sustaining almost three-hour film takes little color special-effects age, it. The colorization added much took away film. Sure, glitches like one Sadhna's eyes make-up negligible. But, inconsistency camerawork, namely choppy switch soft focus became even glaring use color. On hand, pastel shades make frame painting jaded-yet-beautiful texture. Almost like doesn't want forget dated value system advocates. And one watch film paintings poetry, make sure special hand hold you. For love music lyrics, I wish I hadn't watched Hum Dono alone. This shot woman trying best man, etched memory.
