After initial "let's get attention, seat" romantic track, Holiday surprises decent, thickening plot army officer terrorists. But, goes genre Hindi, way many plot holes. And even ignore them, many side-tracks form songs sub-plots take film seriously. You lead lady (Sonakshi Sinha) box, pole vault, play rugby, run, karate lead actor woos her. In one song focuses character, main point seems Akshay Kumar's dance moves. Come think it, I don't think song even lip-syncing. Looks like comic relief ain't enough more, need romantic relief. Speaking which, Govinda misfit and/or waste comic relief here. These come across fillers intention selling product confident about. Add mix, desperate stylisation hero dialogue doesn't belong. Which shame despite gaps logic logistics plot half bad. Akshay Kumar fans might find respite Akshay Kumar-ness film. While I clue exactly fan looks for, I'd say actions scenes cool last, though aren't way many them. Hope helps. On hand though, hardly challenge side. Both, villain character actor dull make want root one way other. Thematically too, Holiday tends get preachy zone, almost reprimanding appreciating efforts soldiers border. Yet, I'd call 3 hours movie hall success, considering nowhere bad I expected be. Do I give film extra points that? Naah. It is. A casual TV watch chance upon it.
