The "huh!?" expression I've carried ever since film ended expanded full question - If title film cause outrage big enough film banned areas country, happen film actually ends issue named after? We'll wait another film find out. Unless, course, half Aarakshan reshot make "not" reservations. After half-an-hour full songs, characters introduced base story established. And hear perfectly logical valid sides quota-system debate amongst students teachers, authorities education media, husband wife, father daughter. And completely sucked drama. Only let loose soon, make sense confusion writer/director seem gone - confusion story tell. Aarakshan (with different name) could touching tale principled crusader, Dr. Prabhakar Anand (Amitabh Bachchan) refuses put down. His fight much government's policy reservation businessmen made education profitable transaction. And concept alone enough weight make movie itself. I mean, I could easily let go title readjusted frame mind accept story lovable, ideal teacher, Prabhakar. But, Aarakshan black white convince me. Sure, Prabhakar good, see daughter's eyes. But righteousness overwhelming let us see not-so-white side. The characters caving goodness doesn't help either. His nemesis, Mithilesh (Manoj Bajpai) outright black makes want slap him, alright. The characters shades gray don't enough screen time let us appreciate them. Yep, including Deepak (Saif Ali Khan) Poorbi (Deepika Padukone). And worse considering movie two hours forty-five minutes long. And even though, performances Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Manoj Bajpai enough pull saga, caveat. Manoj Bajpai loses control climax without build-up towards breakdown. Saif Ali Khan two scenes make point. And something Amitabh Bachchan half asleep. And I cannot stop admiring man, stature industry, still portray common man drooped, burdened shoulders. If only, one film would make us feel, "this" films. If only, film said had. I looking forward deeper understanding issue, I got songs. I told amazing cast put two sides issue big screen, came went (just like issues) flow justifications. I promised film shake sleeping common man action, I got solution better villains film upto. And accompanied loud background music took away little dialogues building to. "Quiet Easily Done" film says repeatedly whenever Math students want say, "quod erat demonstrandu"referring acronym q.e.d. Aarakshan demonstrates centuries wrong done certain castes quite easily undone. And maybe right. Most complex problems life simple solutions. All we, gullible audience, need get together mass protest. And yes, make one call highest authority reach solve problem us. Simple. Yep, that's laughable solution Aarakshan gives us. Now, whose number dial ask politicians call ban publicity stunt Aarakshan team pulled.
