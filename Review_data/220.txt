Diaspora films (at least made India) tendency comment negatively local conditions protagonists live in. They complain racism exact thing. It makes cringe - neither locals behave way, Indians hopelessly bigoted; people sides blatantly intolerant. So, filmmakers either propagate stereotype world live without see scary "humans" screen. To top off, film racism. Very rarely, film even try balance dichotomy. Crook does. At least try. Crook doesn't. Succeed. Crook over-compensates direction. After decent start back forth characters different opinions racism, film goes overboard villainizing Indians. The film takes 'clinical insanity' route explain fanaticism goes beyond realm acceptability falls flat face. Similarly, motivations protagonist film don't hold water dramatic situation gets end. Also, problems, issues, situations, dialogue get repetitive. Yet it's bold film. Also change, I didn't mind watching Emraan Hashmi, reasonable range expressions. Neha Sharma certainly better screen presence posters give away. The rest cast usual combination loud, filler caricatures. How I wish balance struck first half film didn't go control last hour. Oh well...I've always question Indian-culture-nazis live abroad. I finally get ask loud - Why people move abroad want stay Indian hate locals deepest place gut hidden?
