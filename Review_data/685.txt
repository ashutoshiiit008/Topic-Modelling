It best average variety entertainment program. You mimicry, song, dance, skit - woven fit theme. Isn't sad biggest "star" industry mimicry yet mediocre? And get this. Half time mimic hamming, hawing, grinning face-pulling ... Shah Rukh Khan. No guys, sense humor hasn't taken Diwali break. I intelligent enough realize "spoof" genre requires make minimal use intellect. I thoroughly enjoyed "spot-the-tribute" game. I sure I got industry jokes. A even splits. And coolest thing people made fun couldn't offended makers equally vehement making fun themselves. But, angered movie shifted gears paying homage 70s actually becoming one them. Because movies 70s certainly blatantly arrogant. However lame, afford audience justification. No sirs madam, "anything" doesn't go - sab kuchh nahi chalta hai! - Isn’t wanted citizens country say Mr. Khan? The movie reverse engineered. First came idea making movie took dig movies gave "Bollywood" name. Then came list names/clichés/industry trends be, humility, made fun of. Then came individual gags. To followed situations could use gags. This made first half suddenly realization dawned audience "that" stupid. They need plot. So, let's throw first theme comes mind. And go, movie. What also obvious rush get one joke another one event another. The end product choppy abrupt plot transitions. Now, tell me, where's time fit character development chemistry characters? Oh I forgot, spoof - need thing even time. Unfortunately, excuse, I lose golden opportunity truly criticizing Shah Rukh Khan's acting capabilities. Spoof, right? One supposed overact. It tragic Kirron Kher also annoyingly loud pretext. So what, movie, Deepika Padukone, debutante manages get right expressions. And looks drop-dead gorgeous. The good thing woman director many women audience kept happy wet, bare-chested Shah Rukh almost five minutes. A by-product also happy male, gay community. So main woman lead merely used stun pretty prop? The best thing come movie lyrics. Especially romantic numbers "aankho meir teri" "tumko paaya". The picturization "tumko paaya" adorable too. However, choreography faster numbers seems like medley Farah's older sequences thus nothing new offer. The one song work "daastaan-e-om shanti om". It edge, zing, "ek hasina thi" (Karz) tried spoof has. I think favorite sequence end credits. I love Farah Khan giving credit due. But, say movie, favorite bit? These dimwits great sense humor - Farah Khan, Shah Rukh Khan - basically Khan family. Then, could take audience much granted? Yes, festive mood, willing lap anything remotely happy. But, mean shouldn't even attempt sharpen movie bit? Each episode movie bit longer necessary. Each cliché repeated times needed keep funny. Each exaggeration little melodramatic (imagine that!?) make annoying. The entire movie spoof. Then spoof within spoof. Then spoof within spoof within spoof. So far, good. You learnt excuse joke driven situation (versus situation driven joke). Then...well, Farah Khan forgot started Shah Rukh Khan finished script her. And mess - moderately funny, mess nevertheless.
