We grade 'A' fools, aren't exposed kind cinema one dished name 'style' 'thrill'. We don't watch umpteen Television series around world couch, don't know basics murder mystery. Yes, I'm furious. What eyes filmmakers? Deprived souls thankful whatever get? Maybe I wouldn't irked fulfilled least one things set achieve - style substance. The story zilch terms drama suspense. No, pausing every word every dialogue doesn't fulfill need nervous what's going happen next. If make hang every word say, literally, I doze off. The style largely superficial too. Even disregard fact there's nothing haven't seen earlier. Unless last saw Hindi film 15 years ago, style might hold something you. But again, I'd recommend film directed person produced film - Don. Geez, who'd known day would come I'd recommend Shahrukh Khan film Abhishek Bachchan one. It cool Abhishek walked lop-sided stylish walk sat lounging heavy one side, clad white red backdrop. After first time though it's called repetition predictable. You got give something interesting that. Especially next line try impress Kangna Ranaut trying finish English lines hurry. Sheeeesh! Sorry break flow, I can't get much one blind banality basic plot! Not mention whatever Abhishek's character tangent main plot. And writer's confusion transparent - I focus main plot I make sub-plot bigger offer mainstream actor. You know what, I "shhuushed" guy sitting next first hour kept saying, "what bore yaar!" And main "twist" came along, I wouldn't heart resist guy forced foot mouth. Not fair. The filmmakers actually made feel bad right thing. I actually wanted guy pay attention film.
