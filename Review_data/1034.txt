Two disclaimers - I saw Hindi version. I never Kamal Haasan fan. It ages since I've seen Kamal Haasan film. The reason I chose watch film ban - way showing support. I decided watch film even Hindi version wasn't playing theater close me. Even I didn't understand word. Fortunately, Hindi version I could catch. Only find much sillier ban I originally thought was. The group people speaks Taliban/Jihadis/Mujahiddins. So, I get right? Making group people villains hurts sentiments? Whose? Vishwaroop average action flick best shouldn't considered that. I never enjoyed Kamal Haasan's histrionics. He always little over-the-top, caricaturish taste. The thing I liked Vishwaroop Kamal Haasan's act, despite effeminate act induce laughter. Later film, make believe reservations behavior people around him. Unfortunately, people around annoying caricatures annoying, especially Omar, one enacted Rahul Bose oh yes, Nirupama, Vishwanath's wife played Pooja Kumar. It didn't even look like would better dubbing better see English movies TV. Only Jaideep Ahlawat seemed taking role seriously. It doesn't help film forced becoming comedy lame behavior members Taliban. The action except first sequence - pretty cool, especially repetition - pretty ordinary. The rest action tries horrify based gore, doesn't work all. There potential engaging story delves lifestyle Jihadis' families. But soon feel cheated done purpose getting emotionally involved temporarily. Whatever interest created fizzles second half turns regular terrorism-based action flick. Let alone novel, pretty shoddily handled. Almost everything Vishwaroop seems superficial. The dots aren't connected well. And yes, promised Vishwaroop II. And yet, I shall rephrase Voltaire quote often repeated days I might like say say it, I shall support right say it.
