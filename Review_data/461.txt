If compare black white picture J Edgar Hoover Leonardo DiCaprio, you’ll see shockingly different look one another. So I learned latter playing Hoover Eastwood’s next film, I felt wave anticipation. Having enough faith politically meaty character Hoover, Eastwood’s ability bring table perspective (in biopic) might least expected Leonardo DiCaprio’s stellar dedication give best performance raise bar every film – I walked film knowing faith kept A biopic one contributive head Bureau Investigation, J Edgar subtly paced, psychologically underlined film. During tenure head (he’s also responsible adding term Federal FBI); worked around 8 presidents, feared kept secret files almost every public figure. He turn, feared mother (Judi Dench), quite strong words and, politics sexuality best surrounded. She believed, “I’d rather dead son, daffodil son”, could reason homosexuality always closeted. This fact however, never openly discussed film, beautifully hinted passing manner. He also shares screen space another woman, FBI secretary Helen Gandy ( Naomi Watts ). They share first date decides marriage would beneficial him. Watts ’ subtle performance life-long secretary notable. Rumored homosexual relationship associate lifelong friend, Clyde Tolson, public image disallowed homosexual man (or black men woman) become FBI agents. Eastwood ’s film mostly captures public portrayal. In true Eastwood style, 81-year old auteur marks stamp film moving ferocious decline public figure via 2 main time periods: 1920s 30s establishing late 60s recounts life transcribing memoirs. The latter part film easily captures DiCaprio’s finer performance. It’s quivering yet controlled dominant. You tell Eastwood isn’t big fan Hoover, stripped character hypocrisies insecurities. However, magnanimous picture puts forward tumultuous life J Edgar Hoover makes realize it’s public mask Eastwood admired most: overriding, authoritative narcissistic head FBI. The film’s back-and-forth narrative lacks punch parts, Lindbergh Kidnapping case John Dillenger case unfolds. You wish otherwise repressive relationship Tolson could explored more, many post-movie interviews Eastwood mentions that’s saw film. This I meant I mentioned film least expected perspective life J Edgar. Rumours sexuality rife tenure post – even film production it’s angle viewers expecting. In sense, J Edgar stands bit letdown, ignoring potentially controversial subject matter. DiCaprio grows every film, J Edgar testament fact. He grows Hoover film too; younger Hoover bit one-dimensional ambitious enthusiasm, older vindictive Hoover remains one DiCaprio’s best performances till date. Writer Dustin Black (also written Milk) follows fairly similar structure biopic, includes establishment, demystification subtle homage public figure kudos Eastwood sticking perspective (even though bit narrow) bringing personal, emotional immensely political representation J Edgar Hoover. The film could done better lines, tighter, convincing first half (which tries hard establish Hoover likable figure, presumable antithesis portrayal later). However, watch film DiCaprio’s Hoover - inner struggle commendable take someone known America’s second powerful man.
