Avadhoot Gupte must relieved man now. After all, Ek Tara theatres year-long battle censors. This reason enough pep filmmaker momentarily, audience you. If continues bring films notorious making, you’ll doomed disappointment time again. His latest film indeed epic sorts. After all, last time Gupte’s film left middle complexity, stupidity often nowhere? Gupte’s debut feature, Zenda, surely brave take political feud two cousins. His subsequent venture, Morya, delicately portrayed various issues surrounding Ganesh pandals Bombay. While films act purposefully, flaws dullness. Never mind happened raunchy love story Jai Maharashtra Dhaba, Bhatinda. Just like Avadhoot Gupte film, Ek Tara extremely intense premise. But unlike Avadhoot Gupte film, one dies first scene appears futile throughout. Ek Tara (a star) deals rise fall singer, similar Imtiaz Ali’s Rockstar. Co-writers Gupte Sachin Darekar time choose non-linear narrative (Ali’s distinctive style) keep engaged. Sadly, storytelling vague get bored quickly often compare Rockstar. Well; Rockstar far perfect, nonetheless comparison reaches point feel totally disconnected on-screen drama. Not Ek Tara lack magnitude Ali’s vision, also miserably fails gratifying you. The biggest dilemma film endures absence motivation writing, eventually leads irksome execution. Consider this, folk singer aka Mauli comes Bombay enter music reality show. Odds him. A mean-looking channel head – possibly nothing else – lends hand. And wins competition despite absurd style. He becomes overnight success. This innocent guy suddenly turns eccentric, rampant careless character apparent reason. One thing leads another hell breaks loose. But how? If Ek Tara’s tagline anything go by, supposed journey star. But journey rise may even fall? The director might argue saying character’s journey lies between. However, hastily-presented rise barely explains anything. Neither find enough justification fall, begins silly set events.Forced comedy badly written dialogues add misery. Santosh Juvekar versatile actor. Yet, poorly-shaped character sometimes comes across whiny rowdy times. You feel nothing misery glory. This makes film lose battle halfway. Considering storyline, Ek Tara every scope becoming musical extravaganza. The music undoubtedly good, falls short intensifying Mauli’s character situations stuck in. The not-so-exceptional camerawork doesn’t help film either. Apart thing two, film proves one big cliché.
