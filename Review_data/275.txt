The entire movie, frame-by-frame, done extremely tastefully, exceptional treat eye. Of course, ignore Shah Rukh Khan exhibition many faces capable making, this. Fortunately, enough distract us tour. Name – cinematography, art direction, locations, action, special effects – visuals done skillfully. Our brains though taken roller-coaster ride storyteller. Yes, additional twists original plot. While work keep interested, others deprived satisfactory explanation. The direction classy parts. A scenes superbly executed – one Don meets Kamini (Kareena Kapoor), one found dead, one Jasjit (Arjun Rampal) asked work goons. Then others could done better – one Vijay escapes transferred one jail another, one Jasjit taking child away gangsters. Having expectations seeing movie change flavor movie, like food eat changes flavor wine. This movie would much enjoyable constantly comparing. But expectations called paying high profile tribute high profile movie. Comparisons 1978 Don inevitable. We cool new dialogues add spice movie. Some loopholes first movie smoothened little additional back story fills blanks appropriately. But new loopholes blanks crop new situations. Let’s say, new story fair share flaws too. I thought Chandra Barot’s Don long dragged end. I happy lot sub-plots original cut down, saddened soon, new sub-plots taking much screen time. This time pace slackens last hour. You can’t action movie day age slowing end - that’s wrong. Granted, Shah Rukh lot live to, needed follow master’s steps! Was change dialogue delivery, intonation, voice modulation Don Vijay? In Sauna scene, see Amitabh-Don oozing confidence – Shah Rukh-Don sitting there. You see constant suspicion, rightly so, Amitabh’s face ‘Ye mera dil…’ – song Shah Rukh’s eyes full lust like schoolboy, suddenly smartens up. You know Amitabh satisfied happy meets children hostel, Shah Rukh regurgitating lines. You sense fear Amitabh’s body language Zeenat Aman points gun him, muscle moves Shah Rukh’s face corresponding scene. Maybe claimed intentional, it? That’s hard digest. The actors done great job. Boman Irani seems fit role takes up. Arjun Rampal needs special mention, don’t see him? The three ladies Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Ishha Koppikar bit suitably. Though songs greatest listening (again constantly comparing) picturised beautifully. The choreography good especially ‘Maurya’. Shah Rukh oozes energy dances done pretty good job rap-like singing bit ‘Khaike paan banaraswaala’ too. All-in-all, bear mind go Mission Impossible Bond movie, go style special effects see good story quality acting. Similarly, trip cinema halls won’t wasted go one; guaranteed stylish product.
