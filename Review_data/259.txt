Dealing oft-repeated theme Hindu-Muslim situation India without ruffling many feathers challenge itself. Dhokha takes challenge up, also dresses different background, accessorizes convincing back-story. And yet, sticks mission getting message across. The script flows reasonably well. The 'ups downs' build towards climax manage retain curiosity aroused first five minutes. Actually, 'downs downs' - yeah theme hand dark story. The climax feel little rushed again, given sensitivity topic difficult imagine way end movie. Unfortunately, plot points seem contrived. Also movie gets border-line preachy every while. And sermons equal boredom. Nevertheless thought-provoking philosophical one-liners make dialogues little average. It exciting watch two main characters unfold deftly kept consistent - rarity now-a-days. Muzzamil Ibrahim grasped nuances character pretty well. His good looks perfect physique going set many heart thumping. I sure many going mind multiple number showers takes. Tulip Joshi many lines performs wonderfully one scene substance given. That said, side characters absolutely underdeveloped seemed really functional. In fact, Nandini played Aushima Sawhney even fathomable function. What Nandini story except showing Aushima Sawhney's shoulders!? While walking theater, I wondering makes gloomy subject pleasant watch. Itâ€™s performances breathtakingly mesmerizing, screenplay taut didn't notice sadness all. I think along positives mentioned above, mature camerawork lighting added experience. It also refreshing hear good lyrics set decent tunes. Unfortunately, one movies go unnoticed many. I hope people lost belief cinema form entertainment catastrophe called Aag hit industry week.
