There's blunder credits. They forgot title card - Starring: Blue petal, digital ancestral spirit Devdutt, guiding horse Without Drona would lack soul attitude. Not mention, superhero wouldn't clue, literally! Sarcasm set aside, I really liked concept behind debutant blue petal - overuse annoyed me. As is, movie flat pace. Without it'd bend downwards corners form frown. Which would resemble "I carry burden world" scowl Jaya Bachchan wears. Perfect casting! Seriously, lady smile last, screen? It hurts I remember brought smiles mere presence favorite female actor till 10 years ago. Oh well...Anyway, music cinematography character development much actors one-line character descriptions. And 'so much'. Priyanka Chopra dazzles shiny outfits, oh yeah, fights. Kay Kay Menon actually seems every bit eccentric villain he's supposed be. He boast delivered two interesting lines movie. Abhishek broods battles. He delivers occasional dialogue, one awesome! He actually looks really pitiable going tough times. But quickly. Soon enough "What heck going here?" look absolutely reflects audience's sentiments. And stays. Through car chases. Through one inane sub-plot other, especially second half. Actually, I really liked way started. It nice story-telling tone. Characters seemed caricatured personalities reason - part mythological tale. The parable seemed interesting base. The villain seemed eerily weird. The editing slick imaginative transitions. I enjoying despite redundant songs written dialogues early on. What expect egoist, full-of-himself villain says Gustakhi maaf (pardon me)? Yes, I begun wondering wait good, kids', action, Hindi movie over. But, gradually end first hour, inner voice wanted reach makers, demanding interval. Cut now, going nothing say later. They didn't listen. And second half made pre-interval phase blur. You know 'stars' introduced typical masala Hindi movie? - Slow motion, inexplicable melodrama, enhanced jarring music background, cameras making movements make tall actor looking even larger-than-life. The entire second half seems like introducing one actor other! There's bit first half seems negligible end. The emotional drama takes forever unfold - Drona mama, Drona Sonia, Drona father, Drona ancestors, Drona horse, Drona enemy. And get Drona supercool hero taken world himself, needs every move. However, somehow knows combat heroic skills suddenly peak every time needs save bodyguard (Priyanka Chopra). And ain't regular protector, she's 'royal' bodyguard needs majestically rescued every 10th minute! And end it? There satisfactory achievement, mumbo-jumbo saved world. True, quite lame superheroes. He gets special well, he's 'chosen one'. Usually sidekicks set strong personalities interesting idiosyncrasies. But here, time stuff location hunting globe know going spend lot time post production digital intermediate guys. Our man needs right place, right time, right amount background music camera movements couple hours. So, special effects action sequences worth trip theater? Well, I'd think not. If like movies things, must certainly seen already - Hindi movie elsewhere. You think Drona coming age 'special' boy. He supposedly finds love, loses - twice, finds again, overcomes fears, discovers 'inner strength'. He achieves this, times walking steps rest taken care graphics department. The struggle 'external' 'internal' doesn't quite reach high note. And doesn't quite work.
