Blood Money reminded incident school I 14 years old. We asked write autobiography soldier Marathi. After 6 pages turmoil soldier went prisoner war, suddenly set free "The enemy got bored frustrated silence." The teacher asked me, "Did enemy get bored got bored writing?" That's question Blood Money's writer Upendra Sidhaye. After intense effective opening sequence, Blood Money falls regular zone 'whatever' - things like, fresh MBA gets huge bungalow perk South Africa; not-so-warm bosses give settling-in allowance. We learnt get discrepancies real quick. Especially since, soon enough, wife doubts good fortune voice too. Not often logical things happen Hindi films - husband wife talk insecurities. That's I started getting pulled in, despite annoyingly distracting inane songs. A little surprisingly too, I must add. I didn't expect film Kunal Khemu Amrita Puri get complete attention even bit. In fact, while, I noticed I forgotten taking notes wanted watch what's going on. The one business deal shown detail express Kunal's (Kunal Khemu) aptitude, way honest man get sucked unethical ambition, way begins justifying lapses excuse other. Kunal Khemu fine job showing ambition disappointment himself. The audience understands empathizes see dilemma never leaves him. You see he's wrong too, know might mend ways. The rest cast though, superficial be. While feminists disgusted portrayal housewife abroad, I liked way shown dependent husband ways support could strange land. Amrita Puri, though quite mannequin imagined one scenes, emotive either. When character, Arzoo chance sulk, Amrita ended over-enacting. The reason Manish Chaudhary caused scare villain ought to, opening sequence. His stiff dialogue delivery take away character, including said scenes itself. Not mention annoying pet word assigned him. They killed theory pet word/phrase given character could work short everyday language. Oh well. And yet, I enjoyed three characters written. All shade gray, even villain, Zaveri/Zakaria. He gave people chance deciding needed put away. The handful characters though added nothing plot. From Zaveri Jr. (Sandiip Sikcand) Sean (Teeshay) Nandini (Name?) cop (Karan Mehra) - seemed mere pawns writer go point A point B film. While Sandiip Nandini overacted, thus annoying, Teeshay Karan Mehra might shown us talent something dig heels into. That brings last half hour film. The part writers got bored job. From calm potential brilliant mind games two intelligent people, suddenly becomes action film. It suddenly becomes thriller. It suddenly gives birth twists turns. It immediately becomes material you'll laugh at. It's twists bad. But happens way fast. I wonder it'd work events played even pace film ran thus far. Oh well, that'd another film. It's always great feeling get pulled enjoying film little hope from. But, equally bad film takes spiral preposterous stupidity. Then, don't know whether laugh makers allowing hope. Yet, Blood Money watchable ad breaks shows TV.
