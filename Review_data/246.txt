Delhi Safari's animation far superior I've seen Hindi films. But, it's heart true-blue Bollywood film, people convinced go using songs. And aren't people convinced, characters still break song. The writing gets random even songs. Animals jungle set teach humans bit humanity. It looks like writer/director Nikhil Advani wasn't convinced basic one-line plot wouldn't convert feature length film. Almost hour Delhi Safari road film animals travel Mumbai Delhi talk government officials displacement jungle. The road film part Delhi Safari becomes series detours either songs endless bickering Bajrang, monkey (Govinda) Alex, parrot (Akshaye Khanna). Govinda typical loud self. Akshaye Khanna's voice seems moderated fit animation genre. And Boman Irani Bagga, bear times that. The rest cast sound exactly like distracting entertaining engaging, especially Urmila Matondkar Begum, cheetah. I'm sure even blame voice artists barely given dialogue specific animals. The story set animals, make pop-culture references ton inspiration Lion Kingand know way much human world. And it's like situation dearth making animals behave like animals would. If doubt left, wiped Alex's preachy monologue. Fortunately, detailing animation main characters' bodies really done well. The hair animals' movements created great attention. 3D used really well stones dust thrown way opening sequence. Another sequence roller coaster effect created great too. And others opportunity feels untapped like flamingo dance hyena joint. Other that, background, lip movements dialogue delivery general creativity developing atmosphere long way go. Another question lingers target audience. Like I suspected, story line dialogue seems directed towards adults relate references (including scene implies character casting couch) rest execution looks like geared towards kids. Yet, step right direction far animation, especially 3D animation go Hindi films. And needs encouraged. If only, didn't take writing department granted, I could done little heart.
