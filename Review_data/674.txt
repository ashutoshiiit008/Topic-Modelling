No Strings Attached expression casual relationship Adam Emma established ground rules – attachments, jealously, lying, flowers. Life fun start actually enjoy time other. It answers 'not mind-blowing question' – stay without falling love? The characters played well, Ashton Kutcher (Adam) Natalie Portman (Emma). I thought Portman serious actor. But pulls girl next door role (and tough one that) film well. After seeing play something intense, something critical Black Swan, pleasant surprise see play part simple regular smiles fullest dreams like girl. Emma busy pursuing medical career wants live life without liabilities. She doesn’t want get relationship demands much time emotional energy. In couple places, though, blew emotion completely. But given acting capabilities, I'll blame direction it. Kutcher, hand, almost romantic films. I absolutely love part Kelso (That 70’s Show rocks, man!), therefore feels unnatural see Kutcher act normal. He somehow flows really well handsome guy, charming, good sense humor, lives life fullest, doesn’t expect much anybody. These guys get together, obviously… life happens. The story goes fast unsurprising first half slow unsurprising second, yet isn’t boring. . The film lies somewhere chick flick rom-com. Though dialogues funny, many trailer. Of course, predictable last dialogue, always chance notice things story. For example architecture Adam’s house, beautiful dress Portman wears date, funny period mix Adam makes Emma. All supporting characters fairly convincible jobs deserve praise too. I especially liked Lake Bell, plays Adam’s colleague, strong still almost love him. No Strings Attached sweet affectionate, must watch. Oh last bit goes without saying – lots suggestive romance scenes, avoid watching family.
