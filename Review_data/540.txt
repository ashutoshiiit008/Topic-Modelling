"All Muslim's terrorists." In order prove Western world thinks way, Rensil D'Souza Karan Johar go extra mile showcase thing. And, hopefully inadvertently, complete circle cast despicable stereotype deeper mould. Why good Islamic citizens left out? Ok, I'm taking route exaggerating bit here. But bit. A couple Muslim characters Kurbaan fundamentalists blind followers religion. But 2-3 12-13 main characters see faith misused. That's gross overstatement human race's irrationality. And even I'm na√Øve that's things are. How decorating fact star couple help? Saif Ali Khan plays Ehsaan rather stiff. Somehow, doesn't seem ease character. Except scenes Kareena Kapoor (Avantika, girl next door). And scenes really well-done. Kareena looks prettiest without make-up by-far huggable sight character supposed cry. This woman act. It's pity directors find potential size-exponential worth exploring too. The rest cast except Vivek Oberoi drill. No record-breaking performances asked for, none given. Physical intimacy something Indian filmmakers good at. But, there's nothing crude actors fit right. Now, whether scene "script ki maang" (need script) debatable. And clearly, much-talked scene predictable lame ever. The pre-release attention scene intentionally awarded makes timing even obvious. That still doesn't take away fact worth every marketing penny spent skin-show. Delicious! And things major let-downs slick title sequence. It's refreshing, especially expecting Dharma Productions product bank crisp, fresh view New York skyline. Thankfully, smart production values continue that. The background score actually, lack almost two-thirds film worth round applause also tried best keep focused acting reacting. Some great work Foley artist. Similarly, framing individual shots engaging. They different try best build curiosity. But, neither sound visuals take place story importantly details make story. They take beaten path. The community terrorists belong feel marginalized way deal shoot sight - even people belonging community, martyrdom all. Every time someone screen said that, I felt skin crawl. I'm sure line, like many done-to-death dialogues, really strong statement used first time. But, know argument want hear real people talking. Especially makers clear making serious, dark film. How case small terrorist group act void, themselves, apparent help outside? And it's like following one character's story. It's plain stagnant. They want kill, kill, kill kill, kill, kill. Over 5 hours film I still can't figure purpose film is. To entertain? It got way many unintentional laughs, right convenient glass milk showing expected. To tell story? Whose? Avantika's? I know nothing except she's professor psychology apparent insight human nature. Though struggle love resultant helplessness obvious. Ehsaan's? Maybe. But much really know him? He dilemma. Sure, it? I don't empathize him, I don't hate him, I haven't clue does. The story terror attack? Which one? The one planning I wasn't allowed participate? The games counter-games seem serving particular end. I don't like tone films almost feel like take pleasure reinforcing stereotype. Where's balance? Where's grey? Where's human face cold-blooded murder? It one, doesn't it? Are film-makers claiming absolutely non-Muslims involved acts terror?
