It doesn't take long come terms fact going watching black white film next two hours. It different thus engages. The lack color accentuates Himalayan ruggedness. It takes minutes wipe romanticized images created earlier movies shot terrain. The painful struggle day-to-day life needs words. And yet, words crave hear end two hours - long pauses dull voiceovers. You donâ€™t miss color, even though parts actually look like frames bleached. And early on, silences seem artistic, time fruitfully utilized soaking scenery. But minutes pass by, view gets monotonous silence becomes snooze-time. In effort get mood right, story-telling suffers. The premise actually mundane - troubled hard-worker's goods won't sell mechanization taking over, loans become excuse money-lenders cast lecherous eyes beautiful daughter. But character quirks beginning make look like they'll grow interesting. The daughter look troubled tad abnormal, playful - maybe bit childish age. But, time realize seems off, you've lost interest film, let alone characters. At end, wonder actually intention film. Was make us aware hardships inhabitants Leh-Ladakh region - area think beautiful, brutality seeps deep within? Was narrate story Lasya - teenager disturbed world around seems treacherous? But pathos doesn't come through. You don't really feel her, family place call home. The supposed punch end sudden forcefully abnormal "artistic" remain interest. The lack interesting events last hour give motivation decipher interpret possibilities metaphors likes. It still doesn't take away fact something different tried. So timing off. Danny Denzongpa hard-working yet unsuccessful jam seller Gauri plays daughter Lasya best intrigue. I don't remember Danny intense role earlier. And Gauri beautiful talented. I'd inclined say beauty forthcoming monochrome. But still make compelling captivating watch. Sure, it's noteworthy typical emotional triggers missing thus cinematic experience refreshing. But unfortunately lot snores also contribute making feel fresh end credits roll.
