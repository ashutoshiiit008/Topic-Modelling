Marijuana meth kids; cinema real deal. It doesn’t take courage, insight, expertise inexplicable talent create film makes statement existence, life, politics deteriorating state affairs naively call ‘real life’. All takes cinema itself. What stir deepest, stagnant corners insipid souls love? And make us reminisce farthest, forgotten stories love lives music? Qaushik Mukherjee (or Q, calls himself,) leaves Gandu far, far behind Tasher Desh, adaptation – I call only, perhaps, limited vocabulary – Rabindranath Tagore play name. I must confess, exposure play prior watching film reading name mere passing, one many online excursions way back time. Surely, though, I doubt even Tagore would ever imagined play brought life manner. At best, Tasher Desh scathing commentary everything wrong mankind today. At worst, unfathomable orgy images sounds either intrigue put off, depending end spectrum creative freedom stand on. You might either walk film don’t get it, might stay till end, trying decipher meaning wisdom startling visual aural experience you’ve subjected to. Either way, it’s okay – even fundamental differences right wrong subjective nature. To even briefly talk ‘story’ film would thorough disservice it; although film’s one line premise would read much like Tagore’s play – Prince friend (sidekick, conscience, alter-ego, knows?) attempt break free questions plague them, ending distant land across sea – land inhabited Card people; race bound rules order. If think description mysterious, wait till watch film. The first thing film instantly grabs three distinct colour tones used first hour film – black-and-white look narrator wants put production Tasher Desh; washed colour showing Prince, friend mother, Queen, characters play; trippy, outlandish explosion colour seem show states mind characters play. (This third colour tone reminiscent hallucinogen-induced imagery 2012 film Dredd – enough spawn least amount clarity amidst befuddlement.) The appearance three colour tones seemingly random; images cut juxtaposed alarming alacrity. The film either draw right then, reject indulgence (an innocuous, frequently-bandied term realize far subjective simply ‘good’ ‘bad’.) In second hour, trying show land order, film descends absolute chaos. Even subtitles assume life own, visually well meaning. And yet, within chaos, one see beauty pure, uncorrupted anarchy – self-governance self-censorship. Indeed, wouldn’t world far tolerable place every person sense enough control govern behaviour? Here, second hour, film comes own. It no-holds-barred approach towards narrative message gives out; yet refrains sermonizing. It asks much tells, urges see glaring, dismal truth land portrays. The images sounds rapid urgent; unraveling images sounds, however, leisurely. After all, ultimately film – world-view, state mind. The music Tasher Desh another tale trip altogether. The songs supposedly Tagore’s play itself, eclectic, fusion rendition songs, combined lyrics Tagore, truly propel narrative; music easily soul film. To put mildly, Tasher Desh daring Indian film. I don’t know rest world, I sure won’t judge liking it. In fact, I would go far request stay away Tasher Desh; likely kind high won’t able handle.
