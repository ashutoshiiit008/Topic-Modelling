Any story tells us freedom struggle inspires me. On count, choosing make film based event times puts positive column. And it's Chittagong doesn't add experience use aspects film-making, surely every field, acting cinematography direction. Yet, something missing Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se, connect individual characters. There little know personalities characters Manoj Bajpai, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Raj Kumar Yadav. Jaideep Ahlawat, Vega Tamotia play barely appreciate performances. The character whose life given little detail Subodh Roy aka Jhunku played young Delzad Hiwale (instantly recognizable little brother Reliance ad). Jhunku self-doubting, torn-between-two-ideolgies lad Delnaz plays confusion really well. It possible little information characters available converted interesting filmable material. Maybe much reverence characters difficult connect them. They high pedestal addiction conviction beyond understanding attempt identify feels inappropriate. And course, story collectively, individuals dynamics. Be may, story need know. Be Chittagong Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se one chapter history ought aware of. Chittagong crisper shorter half hour, doesn't delve much Surya Sen's private life neither 'top' actress sing songs us. On hand, doesn't 'star' power traditional sense word, though member Chittagong's cast star right. Yet, narrate story almost similarly. Take pick, pick must.
