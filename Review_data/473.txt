A 'Materialism versus idealistic simplicity' theme runs heavily Jannat. So, wins? If easy answer. Such deep philosophical question cannot answered 2.5 hours, isn't answered either. So, looking conclusion, closure, Jannat you. I'm sure could easily replace cricket-match-fixing backdrop dishonest activity arrive result. But, cricket feels fresh season right, not? The dialogues spiced references retired cricketers cricketing events recent past good enough keep interested too. The climax movie reminded 5-6 pages long, Marathi essay I written school - "An autobiography soldier". In end, soldier taken prisoner war released enemy got bored silence. My teacher appreciated writing style made concluding remark, "did enemy get bored, get bored writing?" I smiled sheepishly getting caught. Something similar seems happened writer here. A nicely developed plot got shot middle, absolutely abruptly. Like many movies Bhatt camp, Jannat revolves around romance lead pair. I really enjoy way relationship builds tumult goes through. Important moments given space time develop. There certain human element movies clicks sense expected chemistry. Emraan Hashmi's (Arjun) acting begun growing last movies. So much unidentifiable thing looks used irritate me, little less now. A fearless gambler woo romance lady love right dosage style - falls flat required cry. Same goes pretty looking Sonal Chauhan's (Zoya's) performance too. What I can't come terms however, shabby performances supporting cast, except maybe Samir Kochchar (Inspector/CBI official). Everyone else, Javed Shaikh (Don South Africa) Vipin Sharma (Arjun's dad - isn't getting tired playing dissatisfied dad, already?!), seem superficial reading lines. There way judge well Arjun's friend performing, bad dubbing extremely distracting. On hand, tight close-ups worked really well, used rarely facial expressions important enough deserve exclusive attention. I also particularly liked use handheld camera Arjun. scene interval - sort-of hinting life might good seems all. Otherwise calm camera movements soothing effect. Like softness narrative Vishesh Films stamp it, music Pritam written it. In general, I enjoy kind music enjoyed much Bhatt-Pritam combinations churned earlier. Now, plagiarizing himself, earlier plagiarized one else, different matter together. And I didn't particularly like way title song picturized though - tad artificial go rest film. There isn't much I didn't like movie, yet, leaves okay-ish feeling walking cinema hall. Can't really point finger went wrong scenes people crying weren't good it. It might seem wee bit longer needed be, really reason harsh. So, always, I'm going stick feeling I came with.
