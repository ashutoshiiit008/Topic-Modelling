Not covers/remixes mean butchering sanctified song, including unnecessary add-ons. If handled aesthetically, covers bring contemporary touch beautiful melody - warned, need open mind appreciate them. It’s different story however, film that’s honor Beatles. Your first thought Across The Universe would exactly film gives – lots beatles’ tracks, musical love story every shot homage legendary band – names characters (Jude, Lucy, Sadie, Prudence), street names (Abbey Road) silly little references dialogue. Across The Universe follows personal relationship Jude (Jim Sturgess) Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) placed backdrop Vietnam War - typical, grand love story forwarded 33 Beatles songs. It’s experimental must-see Beatles fanatic that’s - scrutinize anything everything remotely related band – songs, documentaries, books works. The enjoyable thing film, however brings much table haven’t crazy fans. Since it’s musical, songs add sense drama film. Across The Universe eclectic look (with costumes production design) matches psychedelic zone film set late 60s, even though story simplistic, it’s universal nature. Where film wins however, ability bring viewer another visual representation songs – presumably songs they’ve hearing years. How well they’ve covered topic another review, tracks add new dimension song - With underwater sequences spilling Ballet, stage performances turn war scene adding avant garde touch film. Here’s example - I Want Hold Your Hand originally upbeat, peppy song yearning love movie Prudence sings cover slow, melodic manner (right teary scene) becomes yearning song hand might never hold. There many tracks move allow respectful deconstructions timeless songs renewed understanding. For reason alone visual homage Beatles’ works. The 2 disc DVD set like goldmine – featuring art film, audio commentary director Julie Taymor (also Broadway director The Lion King) talks needed make film broadway show , lots deleted scenes, 6-min long featurette usage visual effects film best part – 33 covers songs. You would think making film like would fighting losing battle. The ongoing debate whether covers good/bad/satisfactory doesn’t end Across The Universe, takes nerve visualize film basically originates 33 cover tracks. Across The Universe personality, gripping story that’s pardonable you’ll certainly humming tune two movie over. If find liking song better original don’t afraid - Let Yesterday Be, buy DVD.
