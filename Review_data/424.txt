There’s lot confusion - story execution. As true many stories deal paranormal mental health, Hum Tum Aur Ghost too, shuttles two. Some take sides, argue like drawing room conversation. Here don’t either intentionally. Which refreshing turn don’t get audience involved story either. Unfortunately despite trying really hard. Really hard create sweet moments Arman Gehna (Arshad Warsi Dia Mirza) friendships Arman Mini (Sandhya Mridul) Arman Mr. Kapoor (Boman Irani) ; really hard create comic drama around mystery surrounding Arman’s “condition”; really hard make subject story interesting. I felt like pendulum sways subtle comedy serious drama. And shifts pretty abrupt. As abrupt scenes stuck together – literally looks like film randomly chopped glued together. It extremely disorienting. The entire cast looks like made good-faith attempt getting character. You see romance sweet nothings exchanged. They brought “aawwww” moments, luck. The emotions look way superficial. The saving grace though comic lines subtly slid funny - very. But also quite far between. And sudden tone shift funny display emotions doesn’t help either. Ultimately, entire film feels like one big trial, rehearsal mediocre show. The confusion minds makers way transparent. Maybe situation I’d say, I don’t want thoughts writer/director show me.
