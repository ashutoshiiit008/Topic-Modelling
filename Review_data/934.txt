Strange year ago, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey easily awaited film year, second film trilogy, The Desolation Smaug, arrived whimper comparison. Luckily, film lives promise shown first film, which, engaging visual emotional experience itself, set piece anything else. What watching bunch souls dangerous quest something believe in, moral questions behind damned? What basic concepts like courage, brotherhood, good evil, make well-told story involving become immersive? Yes, Tolkien adaptations advantage adequately armed fodder spectacularly inviting imagery, surely can't all? Surely emotions evoked breathtakingly executed visuals? This time, rejoin Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin band Dwarves - less merrier time round - continue quest began previous film. Their destination, course, Erebor, Lonely Mountain, lies great dreaded dragon, Smaug. Their journey, however, fraught peril. What makes The Desolation Smaug much engaging far darker An Unexpected Journey, actually much understated humour it. It also far quicker paced, completely ups action adventure set pieces; much first film actually seems rather tame comparison. Watch out, particular, one terrific, high-octane sequence involving Orcs, Elves, Dwarves raging river. It easily one jaw-droppingly imagined action scenes year - even better one Wolverine bit fun top Bullet Train earlier year. This scene, indeed, many others film, make heart surge quite like river mentioned earlier. It helps 3D time even better. What remains seen film looks HFR. The Desolation Smaug also takes lot liberties source material previous film, that's something hardcore Tolkien fans talk about. As far intermediate film trilogy goes, bit roller coaster, giving almost time breathe Dwarves Bilbo hurtle towards showdown Smaug. And Smaug finally shown glory; well, one say? Superbly voiced Benedict Cumberbatch, Smaug dragon designed executed persona awe hard take eyes him. If Gandalf Thorin scene-stealers An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation Smaug belongs Smaug. It won't surprising, however, film manages exhaust least part audience. The fact remains hardly ever eases action, action scenes quite long well. The film, despite fast pace, would far appreciated shorter - least couple action scenes chopped would surely hurt. While I'm personally complaining - l loved every bit high energy portions film - would perhaps made sense film slightly less bloated action. Remember, Jackson already fire making relatively tiny book three whole films. Luckily, film ends high - you're left bated breath final chapter trilogy. Danger brewing Middle Earth, The Desolation Smaug literally leave right brink it. If Peter Jackson intends take adventure notch, The Hobbit: There Back Again poised true epic. * Update: HFR Viewing This time round, Peter Jackson Co seem taken cognizance fixed least issues An Unexpected Journey HFR. In The Desolation Smaug, 'fakeness', major complaint look first film, actually gone down. That TV-like quality sharpness smooth frame rate also lesser. And course, big plus point HFR - better visibility fast action scenes - works well film, enough action going it. All all, HFR isn't quite perfect yet, baby steps made, case filmmakers serious long-term technical innovation cinema.
