A Wong Kar Wai film often gives feeling voyeur. It’s almost you’re ruffling pages character’s life, ordinary day-to-day manner. Yet, remain outsider symbolic observations opinions stories. The beauty narrative seen films like Chungking Express In Mood Love - every character every story neatly takes time reveal facets. Emotions become like silent character: Desire Chungking Express Loneliness In Mood Love, molding parallel narratives. The film revels plurality even feel sense connection – emotions, characters slow brewing cumulative story. My Blueberry Nights, Wong Kar Wai’s first English language film, however, undercooked. A film New York girl Elizabeth (Norah Jones) getting heart broken, tries find solace Blueberry pie Jeremy’s (Jude Law) café. Unable cope pain, travels one state another – Memphis, Nevada, picking temporary jobs keep up. She meets quirky people along way (A heartbroken cop ex – David Strathairn Rachel Weisz – compulsive gambler – Natalie Portman) serve distractions pain. My Blueberry Nights’ first problem Norah Jones. Her vacant expression steers far mysterious secret-bearing. To feel sense physical emotional travel film takes journey becomes absolutely essential relate protagonist. She looks part, credit also goes indicative lighting background score, much like Wai’s films also use ambience tell story. As Elizabeth becomes Lizzie Beth different cities, characters meets enchanting isolation. As viewer might able enjoy pure essence passing character you’re able mark difference/similarity random comparison main protagonist – especially film vows explore relationships human emotions. The connection film comes form postcards Jeremy writes her. The problem sense predictable end wandering tale discovery, every postcard. It’s first 10 mins film stay – Elizabeth Jeremy’s interaction, bring Wai’s true stylistic traits auteur. The setting moody; dialogues spoken heard form background music. It Elizabeth trails personal journey whatever seeking, lose interest life aren’t given enough time develop interest new characters. The true perpetrator story My Blueberry Nights soundtrack film. Background score changes per city travels – get hear Cat Power crooning folksy/indie demeanor New York sequences. The film opens Norah Jones’ song ‘The Story’. We travel Ry Cooder country music Memphis end assortment Neil Young/Amos lee blues Nevada. It’s soundtrack urges stay story longer make personal connections. The DVD includes interviews Wai Norah Jones, plus raw footage film. The interview Wai brings us realize treatment My Blueberry Nights, one latest movies, remains similar previous movies – still trying explore play emotions character’s life, reactions brings story forward. My Blueberry Nights however falls short connecting. It lingers around colorful melodies moody frames, shift get narrative end losing interest offer. If regular viewer Wong Kar Wai films however, I urge let mistake pass by. Drool Jude Law, hum soundtrack watch another film’s one.
