Radio comes across attempt comic-strip romance - absolutely unnecessary chapter-divisions all. I realize chapter titles supposed funny fall flat third time come screen. Points granted trying make entire look feel incline towards eccentric. And refreshing. But story random even though meant add madness, didn't quite work. Especially funky start, resilient radio lasted monsoon played Binaca Geet Mala 30 years ago. Wasn't Cibaca Geet Mala aired Radio Ceylon time? Anyways, initial interest, film downhill. The repetitions meaningless "it's complicated" stamp chapter title cards got annoying really quick. Oh yes, I forget "mann ka radio" sounding every 8th minute. One nice tunes get annoying stick head won't go away. Not tune's fault I guess, something wrong irritated humming it. So, however intentional randomness might been, ended getting annoying boring end. The not-so-great, not-so-bad performances cast certainly didn't add experience. That didn't take away anything it, doesn't say much either.
