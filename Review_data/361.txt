The female lead character Govinda woman named Shraavni (or Shravani; I’m sure spelled.) A vivacious, fun girl doesn’t take second turn tough time calls it, doesn’t blink making sacrifice man loves yet one doesn’t particularly adhere hypocritical society self-righteously defines ‘good Indian woman’. Her character easily best thing film. Considering rest film, though, I couldn’t help wonder if, character turned out, bit accident. The man Shraavni love named Rajan; street-smart, resourceful fellow supposedly studying MPSC exam, interested putting time effort celebrating every Hindu festival fervour. This, we’re told, constitutes devotion almighty. What primarily brings film fact that, starting protagonist Rajan, every character film makes character sketch abundantly clear, going behave completely character crucial junctures film. With plot treatment would seemed far home 80s, film’s intentions doubt noble. It wants talk principles like honesty sincerity; responsibilities shoulders you’re love someone; importance family friends; necessity preserve one’s culture; plight politics country; perhaps issues I may missed trying separate one other. In short, Govinda veritable potpourri values people probably don’t time day age. While director Aatmaram Dharne briefly skirts morals principles first hour, second hour goes full throttle shoving various messages film wants convey audiences’ throats, characters stepping deliver sermons full seriousness. The film hold attention longer expect to, though. The primary reason Swapnil Joshi’s performance Rajan. Despite character’s flip-flops – no, footwear – invests completely Rajan. He look tad old playing age supposedly film, look past Joshi’s conviction character. Girija Joshi, plays Shraavni, isn’t particularly great. But root Shraavni nonetheless. Now technique always problem Marathi films limited budgets, film exception. It bears dated look throughout, depends far many close ups make lack production value. Indeed, sometimes one can’t help feel little sorry film, hence little lenient judging it. But sad truth crisp, mature writing would made different film, technical problems notwithstanding. Because film’s 80s-style treatment emphasis values, film may make fair family watch satellite release - kind chest-beating traditionalism self-consciously conservative amongst us might actually enjoy. However, precisely kind treatment people likely forget moment film over. One can’t help feel subtlety would probably successful making message stick; particularly since contemporary India could undeniably values film speaks about.
