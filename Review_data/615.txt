Rom-coms like Mere Brother Ki Dulhan make wonder "love" really is. It doesn't really give deep understanding concept general even terms characters. In fact, way characters fall love Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, clear film doesn't want us take characters seriously. The basic idea fun, things, like logic, etc wait another film. And go writer's definition love - spending good fun time together. Thankfully, "fun" part enjoyable. And Katrina Kaif. It's like cut loose. You sense stiff body language, awkwardness self-consciousness films far, see freely she's breathing here. This freedom also helped fact serious moments film, even character pretty much deep sh!t. So, saves emote anything cheerful face. Within though, aces comic timing. The rest cast, including Imran Khan, look like mere pawns necessary create context jubilant. Even so, Imran Khan goes motions awed stunning Katrina Kaif, Ali Zafar progressively kills bits interest character, every time opens mouth. The accent, mannerisms, body language annoyingly over-the-top. Also, story structured revolves around Katrina Kaif's character Dimple. Her free spirit attracts everyone around her. Sure, dialogue witty enough laughs one all, anyone seen trailer, even heard title film, knows film going end. And exactly why, won't get involved story. We don't invest much attention story know hook crook, inevitable going happen. I won't say writers haven't tried make "how get there" part interesting. They try even succeed bit earlier parts film. But film progresses, situation gets ridiculous. And begin feel climax postponed unnecessarily. Other fillers like songs break abruptly, music especially lyrics entertaining. Also, picturization - dances colors used costumes/art work make screen look vibrant full energy. I didn't think day would come I'd say thing going film Katrina Kaif. Take film collapses material weak. Mere Brother Ki Dulhan starts asking believe outgoing, flirtatious guy convincing brother look wife everything social pressure families gullible parents played around children. They try use wit weird situations characters get into; succeed partially, difficult overlook overall disregard sense rather overt respect nonsense.
