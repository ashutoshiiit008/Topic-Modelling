Utopia exports TV channel Delhi. But course, earthlings contaminate empire. And taken world mean media industry. If spate films "expos√©" genre anything go by, we, audience, either know everything needs known fooled believe that's industries. Rann another example. Had couple performances couple points story could take interesting turn, film would completely collapsed. Also, 'background music files' 'camera angle schedule' Rann exchanged director Ram Gopal Verma's horror film, Phoonk, Rann would immensely watchable hearable. (Can't even give virtual "eye-roll" cause eyes hurt.) And yet two pillars film stands enough make interesting watch. Amitabh Bachchan composed, honest, serious, intelligent TV channel owner, Vijay Malik, makes want look him. And hurts see head hang shame. What brilliant actor! It refreshing see Riteish Deshmukh serious, almost mute Purab, rookie journalist soaking business-politics-media nexus works. More power makers casting decision. Next line, Sudeep Jai Vijay Malik, well first five minutes screen time, role didn't demand anything new. Paresh Rawal yet another caricature role makes evil grin tolerable be. What hurt roles shelled women. Especially, Gul Panag. What point role made contribution except shrieking like third Hindi film actress? Neetu Chandra's character annoying it's amazing boyfriend she's nagging didn't murder middle film. Can't blame bad writing, certainly raised question two script decisions ladies. However, Suchitra Krishnamurty's role bit meatier end she's another man's pawn. (Her character reminded lot Rakhee's character, Geeta Trishul) Interestingly, it's RGV making masala flick. Then shoddy writing women. As is, overpowering existence one-dimensional characters (other music camera) hurdle let film take over. Yet, don't expect better black sheep, dilemma emotions couple white sheep go extremely engaging. And ultimately audience happy white one "right thing" writer/director/both gotten something right. That performance. There points film question lingers, "what character do?" "How crack one?" Only unfortunately, takes obvious path laugh letting brain work top gear. You set thoughts aside, another story - another day. Meanwhile, dialogue crisp topical. While I could easily done without over-preachy middle portion one channel head's speech, beginning end well written beautifully performed. And comes shoddy climax shakes reverie. Oh well. So, nothing new. Same old brigade still camera cinematographer Amit Roy. Same old spooky score background. Same old trying tell story insides industry telling us already know. And still wondering characters struck shock. I hope people like Rann I did, radical movement sorts make media responsible. BUT, case doesn't happen there's still, masterwork acting department partially interesting thread plot, make film worth time.
