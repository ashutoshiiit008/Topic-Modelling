Firaaqisn't first film communal riots Gujrat. And isn't first well-made film either. You sense character approached sensitivity yet there's attempt sensationalizing gory visuals lengthy dialogue dramatizing trauma. All huge potential often used movies backdrop. As dead bodies passed along first scenes know going serious business. And Firaaq offers respite. Male chauvinism, identity crisis, communal differences effecting friendship, impact violence young mind, philosopher's hope, rebel suppressed, innocent victim's helplessness, misuse angst created, ultimately mother issues - solution sight. All brought one other, relentlessly. These facets human nature rightly need variety characters. The effort behind writing character shows clearly. Sure them, like chauvinist Gujrati husband (Paresh Rawal) agitated Muslim (Nowaz) might easier write play standard stereotypes. But, others like sensitized house-wife (Deepti Naval), confused urban businessman (Sanjay Suri) worked hard upon. Use multiple languages adds realistic environment created. A sudden line profundity comes like one person group friends might spurt one arguing socially relevant issue. And yet movie entirely engaging. It could offers closure also leaves sense incompleteness. movie careful it's trying say, scenes didn't really belong. Itâ€™s difficult imagine without purpose I didn't understand distracted me. White, black gray - one actor leaves ounce doubt terms believability - including side characters. Again film full brilliant performances, it's difficult name one even senior them. Because even child blank eyes contributes equally film veterans. There aren't strong fundamentalist characters propagating agenda. So lectures. In fact see situational character's behavior is. There brilliant moments subtly enacted better experienced read review. Firaaqvery, carefully doesn't take sides. There many "good", "evil", "indifferent" characters Hindu Muslim communities. If all, points finger, aims big fat one bias state's administration. As film multiple stories running parallel jerky cuts. But kept minimum contrary transitions done really well. It's also nice hear background music come occasionally. That grants much subtlety entire film. The aftermath riots Gujrat captured trauma human city facing. And course, Firaaqalso talks non-humans looked upon opportunity took advantage fullest capacity.
