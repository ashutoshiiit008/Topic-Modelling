Almost everyone reading review romantic relationship like see Bewakoofiyaan. And would rare couple, all, hasn't fight. Would story make good film though? Most likely, not. Not make boring people it's everyday life. So, everyday life make good films? It does, needs special skills out-of-the-box way go story make engaging story. Bewakoofiyaan story. Bewakoofiyaan energetic, aspirational, young couple Mohit (Ayushman Khurana) Mayera (Sonam Kapoor). You relate less like you. You start rooting beginning. Ayushman Khurana's comic timing chemistry father-in-law-to-be (Rishi Kapoor) keeps matters light engaging bit. But, soon enough things start getting repetitive know it, started predicting next sequence pretty accurately. Ayushman Khurana go whole "down" time pretty convincingly. Sonam Kapoor goes middle class lady takes success stride supporting girlfriend caring daughter ease. But decent performances three main characters cannot life film general bore is. Sure, Bewakoofiyaan try different adamant father's reluctance warm daughter's boyfriend. The lead pair's characters also pretty close earth urban way. Mohit adequately goes phases over-confidence, confidence, insecure bruised ego young man lost job would. Mayera always Mohit, aspirational yet control aspirations. It argued sacrifices career goals isn't woman today's day age made be. But, I'd give writers that. I'd say Mayera knows priorities doesn't care judge them. It shame then, despite characters written thought would see average Hindi rom-com, Bewakoofiyan ultimately falls par. A huge part blame taken film's pace. The love couple, father's sweet reluctance takes time build up. The fallout couple father-son-in-law relationship takes turn cumbersome yet intolerable. The problem climax rushed over-simplistic writing execution. Especially, compared rest film. The old clich√©s kick double force makes feel, sat this? With little going music technical departments then, Bewakoofiyaan feels like listening friend's woes relationship - empathy love; want kiss patch up, already. So, move too.
