You see Rajshri Productions struggling keep times. They trying hard catch generation absolutely comfortable use f-word s-word. But discomfort transparent want stick kind cinema. This time around, solution clash generations mutual respect. A back-answering rebellious youth told age little quicker look older person's point view. The experienced, thus wiser applauded give children chance living life king size. All might possible without lectures (no filmmakers, masking songs doesn't make less patronizing) "tubelight" moments turned dramatic realizations. But Barjatya world. Their characters saccharine-cute coy even reborn glamorized, "modern" avatars. Rajnandini, protagonist transforms RJ, sweetness born go? These sugar-coated, wordless (spineless?) girls exist. Hell, truly, marwadi, "city-girl" might given cousin two run money, came blind obedience. I even dreadful CA! I wouldn't surprised found specimen two like even today. That I think Isi Life Mein doesn't work all. It easy identify mute Rajnandini, I didn't. Sandeepa Dhar, plays Rajnandini, lovely chemistry Akshay Oberoi too. But narrative falls flat. There pique point. When characters subdued willing take life lying down, much audience root for. Sure, happens real life, again, real life boring too. The points interest choreographed pieces improvised The Taming Shrew. The college romance cute didn't grow me. A misfit 00s despite relevant, Isi Life Mein much irony shame. How I wish someone could add spunk subject bring yet again.
