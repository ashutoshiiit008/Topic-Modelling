The biggest mistake I made seen trailers. You've seen trailers, you've seen almost first 30-40 minutes film because, bits don't make promos mere "fill blanks" punch lines. It's good thing one-liners timing delivered, perfect. And though almost entire film predictable, climax deviates "regular" zone making film two notches might've been, promised. The problem though narrative throughout film, seems drab flat, thus film stays average. For know, could intentional film advocates average. In sense, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu parenting styles, generation gap restrictive style could create society's constant insistence unique. As discover opposites Riana (Kareena Kapoor) Rahul (Imraan Khan) are, pretty prompt in-the face, thought never leaves thick finger pointed they've raised. And eventually, almost entire second half becomes wrong-doing parents dealt with. And bit doesn't deviate one bit expected. So, spend good portion first hour get point trailers left us, get point land right middle annoying family squabble. Yet, time aren't complaining whole-heartedly good company. Kareena Kapoor Imran Khan keep entertained. Kareena Kapoor chirpy Riana Briganza exactly Geet (Jab We Met) always joy watch. Especially, since mastered art stopping 'happy' act might get 'trying hard' thus annoying. Such people real life, get overbearing, all. Imraan Khan wannabe anal retentive, easily slips form person wants take, represent section youth figuring identity. This lost identity bit makes chemistry two fizzle since time, feels like Riana coaching Rahul older sister would. And automatically converts Rahul younger brother mold character capable shaping into, instantly wants like her, like younger sibling aspires like older one. While Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu might deviate standard places, various others takes every new-world cliché exposed past decade so. The extra-aspirational parents 'everything goes' parents - caricatures. Not mention given either exaggerated situations over-acting. We also cannot deny 100%-guaranteed-chirpy-woman-of-the-film also quickly falling cliché zone. Sure, know enough type person. But now, sole aim bring change typical, serious man film. And that's getting repetitive across films. Yet, I look forward director, Shakun Batra's next film. There strokes character establishment showed glimpse hope. Like background music opening scene characters' self-description psychologists. Of course, naiveté directorial decisions like say whole Day 1 - Day X super-imposes. One - bad lift-off 500 days Summer; Two - take something like you're going use wittingly throughout, going club days give lamest every conclusion! In many ways, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu trying hard Wake Up! Sid. Thematically, except one change, ingredients pretty much same. Woman distress helped man; man provided personal growth otherwise confident (older too!) woman; one piles-on other's home; one finicky cleanliness, not; cute birthday; parents need confronted; passion photography on. But it's nowhere close predecessor achieved. The one change sweet shifts need encouraged draw real life, I've seen real-life situations panned lot heart-tugging.
