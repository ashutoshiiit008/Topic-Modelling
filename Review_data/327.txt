In way, watching movie falls voyeuristic activity. You break fictitious character’s life/head watch unfold per logic pass opinion events play out. This experience different Nolan’s first semi-feature length film Following. Released Memento, Following amount genius films, yet reason remains rare. Maybe lies charm film. The movie surrounds Bill (Jeremy Theobald) obsessed following people never really interacts them. He meets Cobb (Alex Haw) follows people also breaks homes tries understand personal lives. It’s familiar labyrinthine structure, predictable one. While following Cobb around, Bill meets fascinating woman (Lucy Russel) intercutting, non-linear narratives flashbacks you’ll left guesses calculations climax film. The calculations like mental math though – it’ll like stimulating lavender bath mind spurn conclusions permutations automatically, body transported head lead character even realize it. If loved Memento, The Prestige Inception, Following similar pattern it’s strong it’s premise treatment reminds bits you’re watching Nolan film. He’s used typical non-linear structure, protagonist edgy background score hauntingly merging every feel you’ve slipped back time, Noir crime film low-key/split lighting ruptured camera movements. In confusion, Following lets sit back enjoy fall time, genre logic. The film shot almost negligible budget, pick DVD without special features you’re curious know managed. It could even interesting featurette even interview Nolan vision film culminated Following. Following like rugged, black white poster come life 70 mins. It stuns you, post-modern way leaves confused. You can’t watch it. You’ll become stalker, compulsively follow visuals. The movie demands it.
