Bhagyashree carries Maine Pyaar Kiya show post-marital life would simple virtuous woman like her. Simple may succumbing character, Asmita not. She knows mind compromise take crap thrown way. Asmita, however impractical beauty film. The rest lot ho-hum poor attempt comedy. I often wondered person offends public apologizes, all, private. The basic plot film makes sure wrong-doer appropriately humiliated public. And offended strong conviction get way. Yet, takes exasperatingly long time get also loads eye-roll inducing dialogues served along way. Surprisingly though, there's certain flow script lacking many Hindi Marathi films days. It doesn't come across one episode edited pasted another randomly. One event led smoothly another. That still doesn't mean characters consistent transform smoothly written well. And interactions people seem extremely superficial. There's constant feeling late 80s-early 90s. From way people dressed body language way songs picturised. That also means Bhagyashree looks absolutely sweet side characters absolutely obnoxious. I can't deny it's adorable see bride actually feel shy wedding day. If nothing else it's nostalgic sure. But, we'd much rather watch one films 90s that, wouldn't we? Also, really long songs absolutely hideous. And song song, there's absolutely nothing natural performances - 'put-on' get. If patience sit forward long speeches values, distasteful songs, yawn-worthy comedy pretty impractical yet novel argument end. But patience required abundance.
