Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster creates mystic aura around itself. It ambience heartland princes still reign unofficial kingdoms pride. With background, though story ol' politics deceit. Like good thriller, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster manages make consider motivations character turn, however small role scheme things. That keeps engaged. Though would gotten us involved lot involved characters film. These characters - king (Saheb), queen (Biwi), servant happens gangster, people around three main characters - strong reactions given glimpse justification reactions, feel reaction strong. For example, three main characters shown madly love seems motivation behind strong actions reactions. But, way know love sex person supposedly love with. Other that, clue left love. The emotional connect needed get gravity behavior missing. And yet, based thriller element film, curiosity happen next exists. That curiosity wane progress film way-too-many double-crossing double-double-crossing characters. But still, half bad thriller. A lot credit goes witty dialogue delivery. There something inherently aristocratic Jimmy Sheirgill works towards making character required amount arrogant vulnerable princes today's times are. Randeep Hooda Mahie Gill functional. Given film revolves around sensuality, I wonder film would worked better actors oomph value, especially Mahie Gill. Also, given much film revolves around attraction, seduction sensuousness, scenes shot standard Indian awkwardness making wonder characters attempting make love uncomfortable idea. With that's wrong Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster, still half-interesting watch. Only makes wonder, wonderful film would got even little right.
