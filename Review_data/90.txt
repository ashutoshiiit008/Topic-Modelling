Mr. Siddharth Anand I need word lousy endings films decent starts middles. That aside, I'm mighty pleased missing voiceover introductions. It also helps need self-referencing producer one Mr. Chopra. Worry not, I liked Anjaana Anjaani things too. It funny, crisp, uses every-day, fun, friendly quips keep laughing even though story really moving on. I've always allured topic 'suicide'. Does take strength end one's life face it? No, no, deep philosophy discussed film (except one lame monologue attempted Tanvi Azmi film could done without). In fact, time devoted three acts staggered. It's like two hours two-and-a-half hour film desperate rush conflict. The late arrival takes away could otherwise wonderful I daresay 'real-life' dilemma. A 150-minute film two main characters sounds excessive. This unjustifiable excess makes film seem slow worse yet, banality characters' problems comes through. Suddenly, issue could identify comes across self-obsession rich mindless. I'm saying I want poverty porn, fat fairy tale party-land got tedious bit. Sure, Anjaana Anjaani talks last wish(es) hints towards meaning life. It's superficial though. Because concept focus. It's thread holding two characters together. These two characters get know getting know too. We part journey. They remind us friends have; get drunk fun ever; hurting inside always making people around laugh; tolerate despite self-obsessed sulking. Thankfully, aren't many side characters hovering around. Just imagine see pink-lipstick-hyperventilating friend two minutes screen time. Sheesh. We already Zayed Khan overstaying welcome. Ranbir Kapoor, well, accustomed see fall love realize it. He well without making look like puppy love (despite puppy eyes). So well, I expect less give extra credit meets expectations. Tough luck, dude, bane good romantic hero. O-kay enough beating around bush! I cannot keep raving Priyanka Chopra more. Wow! Has lady eased role actor earth she? Her comic timing, lilt dialogue delivery, pauses brilliant. Her smile screen presence doesn't overuse it. When eyes reflect pain she's going through, want hurt make-up person glycerinated them. Of course, lot dialogue delivery possible dialogue. But, every would go clich√© way, making eye roll inevitable. Also writing department seems taken leave climax shot. Oops! I already complained that. Well, bad. It also hurt bit though movie revolved around woman, life revolved around men life. No career, money worry, unabashedly dependent. I guess I live story woman like that. Also, movie annoying things stick mainstream formula trying bit different. Are snobs audience can't take glam doll's hair place even completely distraught? Do snicker make caricatures queer? An urban tale generation doesn't know way around. You identify problems way put forth. Even though difficult react similarly arrive solutions.
