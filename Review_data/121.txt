Edward Dmytryk said, "In art, obvious sin." Director Atul Kale probably doesn’t understand really means. Had case, Balkadu wouldn’t seen light day. But film released, theater option suffer fruits sins. To put even simpler words – Kale falls brigade directors idea anything, let alone making film. Balkadu outright propaganda-driven film. Well, big news (considering lone reason film exists) nothing flawed either. Take well-made propaganda film instance; intriguing narrative woven around one-sided, ideological message. It misleads without even letting know it. And that’s beauty writing, something film’s writers bluntly overlook every single moment. But least something brag about? A big no, unfortunately. Balkrushna Patil, left Bombay teens live less expensive locality – Nala Sopara, teaches history English-medium school doesn’t look like one. He hears voices several Indian freedom fighters political leaders. He sees psychiatrist beat trouble, one voices refuses go away. All unbelievable thereby starts happening. The voiceover late Balasaheb Thackeray helps underdog overcome fears stand corrupt system. Sounds familiar? Oh yes, does. The film takes cues heavily Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy, sometimes even Lage Raho Munnabhai. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Mahatma Gandhi come alive aforesaid, respective films; Balasaheb’s voiceover (the apparent difference) single-handedly guides common man impossible. Balkadu, regrettably, appears ditto copycat Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy many ways film ends ludicrous tough. What annoys Kale seldom bothered putting effort recite story little differently. The makers definitely seemed mood making things impactful meaningful. Okay, one excuse logic sake story. This film, however, none. Just like Balasaheb’s stiff rib-tickling words, film boasts really powerful dialogues times. He considered man says thought says. Being based ideologies, film’s story (if there’s any) could least acted similar way. The outcome rather otherwise. Because words need backing action, right? Yet I admit this, well-timed (although excessively used) comedy saving grace haplessly mediocre film. Irrespective whether agree disagree portrayal pro-Marathi agenda Balkadu. The camerawork something can’t forgive anytime soon. This film Bombay fails capture core elements truly define city. It instead focuses pointless things, film’s editing production do. I feel, I needlessly harsh Umesh Kamat’s casting seeing Balkadu’s trailer. Yes; go little over-the-top, yet manages decent job. Balkadu everything termed superficial; even theatre laughing, clapping whistling regular intervals. This reminds Singham. Audiences always go gaga underdogs shaking system. If root underdogs stand Balasaheb’s philosophy, chances high already love film.
