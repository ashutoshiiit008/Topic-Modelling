An average looking person barely gets half glance opposite gender. The good-looking people don't necessarily like diva status accorded them. They human, would like approached genuine admirers. These two extremely valid points keep geek beauty away. And Pyaar Impossible actually dwells pretty deeply. Only unfortunately, use tackiest lines possible. So much even girl would want avoid thorough chick-flick. Fine, could give writer credit trying actual story revolving around core love story give film little depth. But, except Alisha (Priyanka Chopra) characters hardly depth. Abhay (Uday Chopra) Siddu (Dino Morea) white black could be. And it's like evoke emotion one-dimensional character potential do. It's monochromatic view world, Abhay's father (Anupam Kher) supposedly 6-year old girl, Tania (who's credited official site), makes everything flat, it's exaggeratedly flat. Abhay nice, father patronizing. Siddu mean. Sure, might people real world sweetness manipulative. But fun watch big screen, especially nothing smart engaging say. Oh yeah, Tania, 6-year old granny either extremely annoying extremely mature. Sorry, doesn't count shade gray. For me, deal shut first scenes Uday Chopra's voiceover 'trying' funny. Ok, might tried prove geeks lousy sense humor, film supposed make eyes roll! And certainly make control yawn give mock-snore dialogues cliché preachy. Somehow, I don't see much choice left actors situation. They exaggerate sugariness bitterness thus come across caricatures. It's painful could refreshing course love 101 good detail, becomes discourse would want avoid. Despite good-looking people playing role perfection. Oh well…maybe next time Yash Raj Films, you'll able avoid clichés created.
