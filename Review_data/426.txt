Comparisons DDLJ JWM inevitable. Not makers qualms comparison made. If only, HSKD warmth DDLJ spark JWM. Yet, attempt different that's applaudable. Now, HSKD modernises DDLJ today's lingo wouldn't far-fetched say average Simran grown become average Kavya. To extent Alia Bhatt's Kavya works. Her adorable demeanor difficult get I imagine people going theaters watch coming happy. But, barely anything post-interval. A lot Aalia's missing over-powering screen presence Kavya's boyfriend (Humpty, Varun Dhawan) father (Singh, Ashutosh Rana) taking reins wants life. This film begins get annoying. This lady, goes small-town Ambala Delhi organize Rs. 5,00,000 designer wedding dress, willing nothing matters most? Instead, she's expecting world revolve around despite else. I understand film wants keep things light I'm thankful don't go siren-y melodramatic us. But, cannot connect/sympathize lead lady she's lead lady, right? What hope left she's either full chirpy-bubbly times desperate. But, Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania scores full points one huge complaint I films like DDLJ JWM - guy. Unlike predecessors, HSKD's guy loser, good hero. For practical purposes, he's well-worth lead lady (since she's made prize money). So, one reason root hero. Of course, Humpty written someone cannot dislike. But root him? I wasn't stumped him. He right things, alright. But, somehow seems little contrived. Which chemistry Alia Bhatt less chemistry mechanics. I don't think find fault Varun Dhawan's performance. Only thing is, script doesn't require much emoting him. Siddharth Shukla plays good boy well. Once again, much demanded him. Ashutosh Rana though charming lot. Not menacing Amrish Puri, maybe, someone never sure off. The characters' motivations place transition one end without much explanation. Almost writers banking audience's forgiving nature, "itna toh chalta hai" (This much "taking us granted" acceptable). Not much stuff worked - except one song, music bhangra disco sounds looks like next bhangra disco number. HSKD cute. It certainly DDLJ catching today's times. So, sheds much dramatization good part run-time. But, also doesn't stimulate emotion, let alone touch within.
