Sure, I knew movie going about. Not huge fan Basu Chatterjee's film either, didn't help. But, The Shaukeens would redeeming factor whatsoever, disappointing. I don't consider prude conservative, watching likes Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor Piyush Mishra lechers isn't idea fun. It doesn't help Lisa Haydon seems playing dumb, looks smart playing dumb. That's say, don't act well. At least men. They jobs well enough creep woman vicinity - screen audience. I don't really much say one except I keep comparisons all-time worst film ever, *Buddha Mar Gaya * bay. And wasn't easiest task that.
