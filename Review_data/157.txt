Blue perfectly good example money can’t buy-quality. With expansive canvas, produced estimated 100 crores, Blue sheer waste money financiers also audiences. The crew comprises two oscar winners - Musician AR Rehman Sound Designer Resul Pookutty, Pete Zucarini ‘pirates Caribbean fame’ underwater director photography, pop diva Kylie Minogue host stars including Sanjay Dutt, Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta Zayed Khan. It’s simple lesson first time Director Anthony D Souza basic premise good movie solid script star power! In preposterous statement Anthony D Souza said necessary restrict film less two hours. But sat entire 117 minutes (minus interval relief) movie could’ve much shorter. I actually bored towards end movie. The movie marred almost non existent script, weak dialogues, lack luster music poor direction. The story predictable beginning therefore lacks twists turns absolutely imperative action packed thriller. Instead roller coaster ride high adrenaline volatile circumstances, movie prosaic ridiculous climax. It much slow movie genre push viewers edge. Lara Dutta probably factor left viewers gasping asking more! There doubt movie moments. The impressive underwater sequences (Pete Zucarini) especially one Sanjay Dutt Akshay Kumar actually ride shark take breath away. The lighting underwater sequences spectacular look chic. It also boasts exhilarating action sequences land water. The bike chase sequence ‘fast furious’ pushes viewers edge. Lara Dutta’s sculptured body adorned gorgeous bikinis pushed oomph meter unprecedented levels visual treat all. Blue set sun soaked beaches Bahamas. Sagar (Sanjay Dutt), simple guy polished deep sea diver befriends Aaraav (Akshay Kumar), rich ambitious businessman loves women good life. Lara Dutta (Mona) plays Sagar’s wife eye candy. A fat Sanjay Dutt laughable sea diver gives good performance otherwise. Akshay Kumar looks uber cool grey goatee hot body. Zayed Khan’s performance ignorable cannot emote nuts. The high point film definitely Lara Dutta give actresses run money post memorable performance Blue. She looks fresh morning mist adds panache bikini clad character look vulgar all. The dialogues absolutely ridiculous inarticulate. Lara Dutta tense moment exclaims amidst bullets villains, “why don’t talk sort things out?” Amazing isn’t it! The dialogues almost contemptible. The music surprisingly doesn’t click all. The much hyped Kylie Minogue number “Chiggy Wiggy” disappointing. The songs (that I cannot even remember vaguely) forgettable melodies. The last song “fiqrana” manage stay head easily replaced. Seems Mr. Rehman conscious new stature post Oscars played much safe. The director Anthony D Souza must realize making good film bulging budget star power putting fancy visuals screen. A good film foundation strong solid script façade comprises mentioned facets right combination. Blue could’ve defining moment history bollywood instead damp squid.
