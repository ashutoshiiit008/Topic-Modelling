Boy, superlatively inept schooling system not? I know. Educated degrees I never hope interested in. The brilliance system (teachers, parents, government, kids) I didn't even realize it! It didn't even occur I could creative streak? A complete 180 degree overhaul must, everyone's attitude, including students themselves. A powerful medium called cinema many time takes responsibility showing us flaws. Paathshaala rather regressive, age, schools trying best get rut. Unfortunately, film awful job, want hold mirror them. So, let's give shot. Getting credit-where-it’s-due part done - At time, dealing non-standard topic make Hindi film huge risk, something I really appreciate. Also, whether I like not, point view presented contemporary topic. Also, it'd easy writer/director plugged romance, ensuing songs maybe even related complication two. But refrain evident. Also sweet moments every while. You'd think someone who's smart enough make decision also use logic, least partially, rest story. But apparently that's much expect FTII product (I wouldn't said that, hadn't tagged name titles!). So, pick pertinent issue go ahead pick extraneous factor focus on. I mean, "schools becoming businesses"! I could've borne issue - know, audience say topic writers choose first place, right? But, SO many things wrong examples sub-plots chosen. First all, 100% people involved reality shows publicists inhuman? You want stereotype directors TV shows, ok. Granted. But assistant directors, photographers, agents…everyone living without heart? And heartless people management school. If things agonizing enough, inexplicable silences characters blind following characters without rhyme reason. So many tiny sub-plots seemed like squeeze point might might flow rest screenplay. For example, Hindi Marathi teachers don't like fact Rahul (Shahid Kapoor) English teacher. Not know carry attitude, conveniently changes next sequence!?! And short stories abundance. And let's even get laughable climax main story. In ambience, Nana Patekar, Ayesha Takia Shahid Kapoor best lame script inane lines. Even worst, three could chosen better script this. Oh well… Schooling superfluous. The argument school facilities updated moderation half-baked. Monsters don't rule television shows. And evils money-making way "old-school". * By way, what's wrong school profitable? Also, charging fees make school evil, providing facilities? And wrong good infrastructure? Isn't access latest possible technology necessity rather luxuries? It's like intention build school poor, think teaching philanthropic. No clue teachers shouldn't paid competitive salaries. And clue money come from, it's hike fees. Another profession nobility demanded doctors. Why person spent 27-28 years life educating earn himself?!
