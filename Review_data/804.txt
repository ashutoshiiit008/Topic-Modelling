For starters, let's set aside fact Kaushik Ghatak's Samrat & Co recreation Sherlock Holmes-esque character, India - absolute travesty recreation that. No, first let's talk film independent cinematic work, murder mystery thrust hands super detective. Mumbai-based celebrity detective, eponymous Samrat, receives strange case pretty young lady, case prompts travel Shimla. Ultimately, series murders unfold, Samrat races time connect clues strewn across path solve case. Unfortunately, we're served plot (that's anyway older hills film set in,) succession rather juvenile 'mysterious' circumstances events shouldn't challenge schoolboy, much less supposed ace detective accurately guess person's life history within minutes meeting them. Predictably laden red herrings galore, film tries hard clever, falls flat writers either underestimated audience, over-estimated themselves. Big work made silly substitution cipher codes clues simple A-B-C. The tangled mess screenplay bad enough, makes matters worse film shot chroma background, computer-generated scenery added later. It gives film fake look throughout; pity setting film hills gave film chance visual treat, chance squandered filmmakers. Now let's get film's real crime - attempted murder Messrs Holmes Watson. A mockery made iconic literary characters, Indian counterparts Samrat Chakradhar resort showboating, buffoonery general incompetence, relegating common sense propriety forgotten corner. Rajeev Khandelwal, fair performer otherwise, really overdoes Sherlock, less said guy plays Watson, better. The supporting cast film essentially assortment people over-acting under-acting. In attempt draw least something positive film, one say least never drops pace might even keep interested silliness times - wonder much harder makers film try. Hopefully, Samrat & Co die death film, future filmmakers think long hard creating lightweight caricatures characters enthralled many generations.
