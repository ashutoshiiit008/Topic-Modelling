Most us probably heard story man who, many, many years back, thrown train compartment rightful ticket to. The man went become rallying point entire nation wished free colonial rule. If pause think, wonder whether India would've attained independence Mohandas Gandhi less affronted apartheid racism faced. The Hunger Games series heroine, Katniss Everdeen, much same, really. Katniss never wanted rebel oppressive regime Panem under. All wanted protect sister. Yet, one little act thrust spotlight, as, end second film, became symbol rebellion Capitol. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 begins almost exactly Catching Fire left off. Katniss, remember, inadvertently disarmed force field enveloping arena holding Games. She air-lifted group rebels, much chagrin. If don't first clue I'm talking about, film isn't anyway, makes little attempt refresh memories. The whole film treated assumption audience familiar first two films (and not?) More first two films, third film four-part movie series really provides insight kind person Katniss Everdeen is. It also reinforces sheer talent Jennifer Lawrence is. One almost feels J Law face situations real life Katniss feels film, she'd probably react exact way. I keep coming back word I always like use actor character - 'spunky'. Righteous, never self-righteous; shaky never nervous; angry, almost never control; Katniss heroine you'll love more, watch her. Apart her, though (and presence one Phillip Seymour Hoffman), there's little film makes must-watch itself. It unavoidable you're watching franchise, also really conveys little new, apart figured end Catching Fire - revolution brewing, Katniss Mockingjay - symbol revolution. What's disappointing Mockingjay Part 1 little action film; fact, isn't single large action set piece, isolated little scenes. Yet, lacks action thrills, tries make little things, like interesting sub-plot Katniss filmed propaganda purposes, Leni Riefenstahl-ish female director boot. Still, nothing quite make disappointment getting see Everdeen display much archery skills - one highlights earlier films. Director Francis Lawrence handles film like mixed bag. He seems grip emotional graph wants follow, arc film actually little overall story, sometimes wonder novel Mockingjay could made one film, neatly wrap series trilogy. The first two films saw Katniss make giant leaps revealed nerves steel, unabashed virtuousness fierce talent. This one, well, seems like place holder. Hopefully, fireworks, excitement thrill left final film, take us conclusion Katniss Everdeen Panem's fight freedom - kind fight we're subconsciously familiar with, always resonate done well. But that, Mockingjay Part 2 go many, many notches Part 1.
