Gareth Evans’ 2011 flick, The Raid: Redemption, (which dubbed English released worldwide 2012,) quickly became cult action flick. It best cable-less action you’ve seen screen, gritty punch made relentless, albeit extremely violent, action entertainer. That film threadbare plot, honest, worked good fight scenes were. Evans takes step further, The Raid 2. The action scenes, terms screen-time cut favour actual plot; one that’s particularly novel, think it, one makes interesting setting high octane action expect sequel The Raid. Think Yakuza film crack. Rookie cop Rama previous film, (who miraculously made film alive!) convinced go undercover infiltrate help destroy crime syndicate control streets beloved city. The mafia, course, politics play. If go expecting hooked action word go, you’ll disappointed; lot time spent establishing setting Rama works way upwards crime organization. Evans much higher budget time round, shows. In terms treatment, film quite different predecessor - smooth precise camera movements, multitude locations, nice non-linear editing pattern certain scenes, overall superior production quality. The hardcore action scenes still there, course, they’re quite terrific. There plenty violent bloodshed, film definitely aren’t fans raw violence. Apart sprinkling throughout film, action fans satisfied go film one particular car chase scene latter half. It executed imagination raw energy, leave salivating. What one misses, however, threat Rama’s cover blowing. The film concentrates much political machinations play crime world never really get sense danger fact Rama might discovered truly is. The story lacks sense urgency it. Adding film could truly taken someplace else. Personally speaking, I’d happy see even action film, that’s made The Raid much fun. Yet, The Raid 2offers enough adrenaline-pumping stuff keep hooked, set expectations right, plot works well. Evans firmly established genre specialist, The Raid 3 already announced, certainly film watch for.
