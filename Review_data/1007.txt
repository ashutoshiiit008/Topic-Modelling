Like many themes converted films, mechanical corporate sharks wanting take warm, cozy place associated lot emotions, new. But Tum Milo Toh Sahi makes genuine effort make meaningful. The emotions superficial, identify characters. And yet rooting protagonists neither want take "wrong-doers" court. Tum Milo To Sahi little bit lot things. The obvious one comment disregard saving country's heritage government citizens. The "metropolitan corrupting small-town simple-mindedness" take hard miss too. Then ambitious characters judged greedy insensitive mask westernization. Society's lack sympathy towards unmarried mother frowned upon too. So much say, little time. And thus, everything said rush audience can't engage anything all. You watch interest involvement. And things hold interest place almost till end. Dimple Kapadia Nana Patekar's acts completely spell-binding. Dimple Kapadia, fact, reminded character Saagar. Buoyant sensitive, loud thoughtful, street-smart direct. Nana Patekar usual frustrated common man deal, well. The rest actors though completely veterans' league, though. Especially kid over-acts notwithstanding over-done Australian accent. I enjoyed set-up beginning too. The camera-work way introducing characters different pleasant. Usually I get annoyed film hardly long shots. But, one didn't disturb me. Though I think I'd grasped characters better I shown environment every while. The story also played connected numerous characters pretty well. Despite predictability, piecing together different sub-plots fun watch. But alas, goes phut last 20 minutes. All logical reactions given characters go complete toss losing head tail. Characters transform like attained nirvana overnight. And soon enough nice film becomes eye-roll material. The lines fun sporadically. The preachy ones one wants hear entertainment education. However, lyrics title song pleasant surprise, especially considering mediocre writing film. A comment vacant space relationships general human disconnect insightful. It's disheartening last 20 minutes undo work first 110 badly. This one make decent-enough watch DVD TV release. Till then, IPL??
