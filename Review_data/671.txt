Your personality determines taste. Now, pretty obvious statement! I consider liberal, concept father falling love daughter’s friend crosses line jell personality. Yeah-yeah, older people fall love much younger people, falling love natural. I understand that. But, reading Nishabd gave feeling get think long nails screeching blackboard. Going struggling rid feeling, trying hard judge book cover, coming thought, “so, love, all?” – means movie worked. It touched chord somewhere, especially considering attitude towards subject. Ram Gopal Varma played first card right. He cast person could pull (commercially) Hindi cinema. On way really feel bad Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) even though doesn’t fit moral boundaries. Vijay’s character fleshed mostly consistent. The grim lighting monologue narrator worked show human resigned dark side. May disappointment many, thing works best conspicuous absence lust. The ‘lollipop’ Jiah Khan’s ‘finger mouth’ promos misleading. There fireworks here. And charm. Jiah might beauty personified screen presence grabs attention. And skimpily clad. In couple scenes, one movement face, knew mood in. The dialogues crisp keep interested throughout. The characters left nishabd ek-shabd need dialogues. However, whole movie lacks depth. In tastefully handling main relationship, relationships ignored. The makers took easy route. To highlight intensity Vijay-Jiah relationship, abandoned explanations relationships. My rather huge complaint background music cameraman. What suspense-thriller type music camera work? The aerial shots tea estates well-shot, close-ups dancing camera one angle annoying. So, okay father encourage romantic relationship daughter’s friend? No certainly not, even Amitabh Bachchan! But, story told well dialogues performances. Why higher rating then? Because felt incomplete.
