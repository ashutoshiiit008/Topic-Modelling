"Knock-knock" "Anyone there?" "You...you multiplex cine-goer...yeah, yeah - we've made you...a collage horrors interiors country suffers from... "Worry dearies, we've masked dose humor make palatable." Yes, Welcome Sajjanpur educate us situation rural India, slightly patronizing tone. And good job too. The seriousness toned wit albeit slapsticky places. It tries sensitize without overtly sensitive. Which villagers might find issues trivialized. Issues grapple day-to-day basis. Without qualms, movie refuses offer solutions. "That's job", says. We taken upon let know what's happening there. Look here, mere signature literacy census, animal rights taking precedence human livelihood, "widow remarriage" privilege. Sure, knew superstition blind faith seep country's veins, 'politician' synonymous 'goon' farmers sell organs keep afloat. But, might well reinforce existence. Oh, way, it, let us remind need shake eunuch disgust! You know what, though, things don't necessarily end badly, alternative outcomes. That's whole lot ground cover. Using one two colorful, relatively well-etched characters each, Benegal highlights issue issue form montage village, Sajjanpur. The narrative tone topped border-line loud Shreyas Talpade started getting first 10 minutes. And throughout, I wondering, "why tone?" Why characters disappearing? My suggestion, don't fidgety like me, there's reason you'll know need know. Similarly, songs add unrealistic feel. Besides bit maintain light tone film, way reason. I'd enjoy rhythm adds mood village - group people don't lose smile despite trying circumstances. Flipside, course, add length movie. And that's one place Welcome Sajjanpur misses mark big time. It needed least 15-20 minutes shorter. And despite climax rushed up. Maybe trying something different narrative style, felt like quick fix. The thing accent. For reason, came across forced. One reason could Rajeshwari Sachdev Amrita Rao city-bred image difficult shake off. Add fact show non-village-like attire every while. While Amrita charming wife pining husband come back her, Rajeshwari looked really uncomfortable whole set-up. Smart-alec heart, Mahadev (Shreyas Talpade), keeps curious throughout. How going put emotions next letter writes one villagers? You want dreams come true, however murky morals behind be. Am I one thinks Shreyas Amol Palekar every while? Each cast members adds his/her flavor village ambience. But, one stood Ila Arun. I imagine one aunts native village. You read newspaper go day. You'll, probability, watch movie, maybe applaud effort, go life. There long-lasting impact, maybe, maybe stories stay you.
