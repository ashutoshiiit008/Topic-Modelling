Dhak-a-chik-rap-a-chik-dhak-a-chik-dhak Absolutely let know excited I Hindi movies back theaters!!! And another... Dhak-a-chik-rap-a-chik-dhak-a-chik-dhak ...because pretty good restart. Nothing beats good hearty laughs. And pleasantly surprising too, considering promos made look like slapstick affair. To start with, color palette used sets apart otherwise unnaturally bright comedies. Then background music well done loud all. And things good enough make-up Kunal Khemu's non-voiceover voice lousy chase scene. I almost sure things would change worse titles, titles pretty creative adorable. And story line started getting interesting too. It ain't rosy, though. The romantic bits drag fair deal lines intended funny fall flat. But silly bits giggle-worthy lines actually witty insightful both. It helps Cyrus Broacha kept tight rein - subjected toilet-sexual-humor allowed get loud. Kunal Khemu also doesn't annoy much goes functions without deserving either claps slaps. This obvious cakewalk Boman Irani. I absolutely enjoyed Amit Mistry's comic timing. Oh yeah, there's Soha Ali Khan too, functional eye-candy. With positives negatives delicately balanced, final tilt towards positive certainly climax. Everything neatly tied quick wrap-up, yet doesn't feel like came soon. Also maintains tone film aren't character transformations make go "yeah, right!" Interestingly, characters don't qualms cheating unabashedly aspiring big buck. They similar traits goals, pretty much flat. Except lesson two learnt start end pretty much place. Yet doesn't get boring one different shade grey. I thrilled way fresh inflow films begun. A nice, light-weight, witty entertainer.
