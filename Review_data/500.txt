As expected, Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal everything thought would â€“ loud, ridiculously incoherent annoyingly induces sleep. Yep, I strongly resisted urge nod waiting interval. I guess loud let doze off. It shame watch Paresh Rawal repeat endlessly try put heart it. It frustrating watch Om Puri loudest best. It disappointing see Nana Patekar come back long time nothing character except play emotionless, course well. And extremely upsetting see Shreyas Talpade reduced shouting name acting. I even going venture talking plot doesn't make sense, character transformations, etc. Any effort I put seems like would writers could bothered with. The minutest interest triggered good-for-nothing shameless Johnny (Shreyas Talpade) is. But wears off. How long hold yelling all? What I left film ordeal course review it. But also thought. It's easy pass verdict say films shouldn't made. But, thing keeps actors game? And trade-off also keeps directors/writers too. Tough call.
