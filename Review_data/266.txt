The poster says loud clear, Rani Mukherjee going dress man play cricket. Cricket gentleman's game. Watching film made think lot phrase "had heart right place." And I wonder crores Rupees writing muscle Yash Raj capable mustering cannot art right place, good heart doing? And way, hypocricy! Rani Mukherjee definitely bigger role Shahid Kapoor, Shahid gets first billing. The audience outgrown Punjab, lush green, mustard fields, "chak de phatte"s, "Ik Omkar"s. It's sad maker's heart still trying juice last drop them. Don't want change scenery? It's what? At least 10 years already. Oh, weren't enough, there's bhangra beat background music - CONSTANTLY! Except songs, doesn't stay background. Oh, don't even get started jingoistic flavor added characters - half-dimensional first place. "England" - bad, "Indian" - super good. No texture, flavor line thought all. Actually, can't blame experimenting though. It takes fair amount creativity conjure couple Shahid Kapoor Rani Mukerjee it. While dismay guided towards aspect film dining room conversations, I curious see worked out. And verdict Shahid Kapoor looks awesome, cakewalk role alternate romance serious, almost play Shah Rukh Chak De! India. Rani Mukherjee looks good brilliant smile hers, well role without shrieking much considering she's Punjaban that. Oh disgusted thought bikini, worry not, isn't much negative-marketing gimmick. Together - create zilch. You don't feel couple, don't care going get together not. A huge portion lack "chemistry" course, story screenplays fault. There's flow, scenes impact, nothing. It like, "a woman aspires Indian cricket team. Hmmmâ€¦nice interesting. Let's make film." How gets consequence. You need comedy, need romance like need salt pepper. Add, mix audience eat it. No matter gag it. This one house Yash Raj Fairy Tales unacceptable. In name women empowerment, women still mere props. Sure, Rakhi Sawant Sherlyn Chopra script objects lust, might've comment irony women's status Indian society, it's bad taste. And thus film better others use premise. Oh boys, need rush theaters display skin, amount cry-shy drama-shama, I guarantee won't worth it.
