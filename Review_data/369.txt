If expected, Gulaab Gang would disappointing. So, trailer pointed out, film one dramatic scene another without respite. The drama magnified Madhuri Dixit's emphatic dialogue delivery Juhi Chawla's drawl. The latter actually grows bit. Juhi Chawla's Sumitra cunning every second politician actor makes easy hate her. Juhi Chawla best required portray Sumitra's fickle ego. Unfortunately, Madhuri Dixit's character, Rajjo Devi directed way option play character extra style, even little village. Once get though, see Madhuri Dixit tried hard work variety within restraints many slow-motion sequences forced, strong one-liners. It shame then, despite one-liners, film lacks punch. There side characters retain interest again, less clones respect personalities. The writing overall film takes audience's need justice women granted. Right titles, never given enough cause side gang women take justice hands. It assumed know bad wrong wrong-doers is. Given that, punishment Gulaab Gang decides also accepted apt. Moving on, situations created seem disjointed. It feels like sequences conceptualized independently fit together forcefully. For example, sub-plots used display Sumitra's borderline megalomaniac personality go overboard within context film. Thus losing awesome dark character could building really powerful story justify intense sub-plots. Then left vibrant songs. Here I concede, watch Madhuri Dixit dance, I don't need context see grace elegance incarnate. And she's even best. She must actress actually dances. As opposed actors potential convert even melodious songs aerobic beat. Even so, disservice topic hand - empowerment women poor interiors country, one major things I take away film (not best) dance sequences.
