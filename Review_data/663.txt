As movie buff I would watch movie creative concept. Unfortunately, however, get support departments. Also, it’s shame overall plot imaginative, way many individual scenes clichéd say what's going happen next eyes, ears brains shut. As thriller should, movie moves remarkably fast pace know watching interval previews. And thus time wasted character development, detailing consistency. Also actors playing characters don't help cause. Barring Akshaye Khanna, rest ensemble either drone make sleep shriek wake up. And isn't Akshaye's best performance either. Part credit lousy acting characterization also go ridiculous dialogues. They seemed hard time trying decide whether comedy suspense thriller. I willing take bet would much better product chosen one stuck it. Mixing two done irreparable damage it. Especially since thrilling twists turns, unintentionally, make laugh juvenile comedy makes grit teeth anger. And back forth manipulations second half become tad exhausting viewer. The saving grace director photography, editor, sound designer shown considerable restraint. Given locales subject movie easy go overboard departments. On hand, I seem run ways complain Sameer's lyrics. And original music Pritam time? That could explain worse mediocre. What I find amazing work art passion artist creates it. In movie exciting many passionate people involved. But unfortunate almost everything looks like half-hearted attempt. What waste clever idea nobody felt need pay attention details!
