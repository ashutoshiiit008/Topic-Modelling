If there’s one thing one grant makers Now You See Me, fact seems like rarity days get big, star-studded, concept flick isn’t sequel, reboot, remake adaptation. That isn’t say Now You See Me much going apart this. Despite hooking premise palpable sense tension creates always seeming one last trick sleeve, film runs steam overplaying hand tad often. With foot pedal word go, film introduces us four different street magicians united mysterious hooded figure larger purpose; Four Horsemen, called, begin pulling series grand illusions, continuous promise coming back grandest deception all. Building sleight-of-hand tricks we’ve seen ever often (inspired illusionist David Copperfield), film coasts breezily along mystery manages evoke right initial frames. As one character another introduced, proceedings begin gain momentum, succeeding least initially, hooked. However, know things bound go south film never eases twists turns, except goes predictably cumbersome almost-romantic track Mélanie Laurent Mark Ruffalo, play Interpol FBI agents respectively, hot trail Four Horsemen. The film comes cropper last act, build up, deception grand journey leading climax - prestige, – turns bit damp squib, final twists predictable mile away. Also, film one miscast films recent times, terrific actors playing bit roles didn’t deserve them, could played sleep. Morgan Freeman Michael Caine particular, particularly thankless roles. Even characters played Laurent Ruffalo, matter, could easily played anyone else. Having said that, play parts expectedly well. The Four Horsemen, played Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson Dave Franco, manage pull characters fairly well. Eisenberg, particular, seems chameleon; I didn’t think could portray suave, confident magician ease did. Fisher looks great, Harrelson quirky always, Dave Franco seems little rough around edges, manages hold fort. My biggest problem film, however, misuses audio-visual medium attempt throw viewers track heading, rudely jerking back twist blue. Common tradecraft big Indian well American films, fact ‘show’ viewers something misused blatantly showing something doesn’t really exist twisting intent visual, confuse them. (Think times character turned back others scene give ‘mysterious’ expression audience see, never referred film, later explained away unconvincing bit back story.) This film literally derives trickery concept. Alfred Hitchcock’s favourite term, ‘MacGuffin’, used describe device, sounds innocuous enough, something I’ve personally problem achieved cinematically. Now You See Me pretty much one grand MacGuffin another, shamelessly used throughout film (and good effect, I might add, I could still spot twists way even revealed twist coming). Despite hiccups pepper film, Now You See Me isn’t really unwatchable, premise genuinely held potential moments make sit wonder. If don’t mind played deceived often you’ll remember film done, might guilty fun. Otherwise, I suggest wait film come satellite DVD, go back 307th word review, film I’d recommend instead.
