The devil lies details. And Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge wonderful job getting mini-situations situations, right. The lines clever, delivered smartly control. Some back forth characters quick, miss told. Not annoying hurried, quick. The kind pacy dialogue makes sure, missed something good, given tone film. Full credit almost brand new cast.
