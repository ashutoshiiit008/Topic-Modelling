If one thing learnt Race trust one. No one all. And doesn't change Race 2. Characters make Abbas-Mustan's world conniving. Even seemingly annoying trying-to-play-dumb Cherry (Ameesha Patel) sly way, within context. This world would passed decent fiction, contrived twists tale weren't unending. Each character getting chance smirk, "I knew it. You thought fooled me?" "I planted ploy put off-track." gets tiring. If everyone knows everything, watching film for? To figure knows less? The one-upmanship keep intrigued long. Can limit one villain claims everything owned villain his, profit 5 billion Euros good enough? Even relative terms, 5 billion 33% profit 2 days! Fine, I shall control Chartered Accountant me. Hey, lead characters look like million bucks. Or make billion. While I rant rage awfully distasteful objectification women here, loathsome say least, I admit gender equality maintained objectification. John Abraham Saif Ali Khan bare-chested long enough. And others look like alternate plan double-crossing mind, John Abraham manage create extra amount scare, makes character plays, Armaan Malik, look like he'll stop nothing. If oomph added terms good, memorable dialogue characters given little depth, would given something people like chew on. Unpredictability seems like exists increase run-time film, hasn't done job well. The chase sequences, fight (boxing) sequences, scenic beauty various exotic locations captured well - right close-up scorpion scorpion shaped party deck aqueduct mountainous beauty Europe. But, what's shoddy graphics work? From bullet leaves sniper's gun airplane sky - one botched job another. Unfortunately, X-factor songs either. They look - film, across films genre carry glitter, glamour gleam pride. No novelty whatsoever. Beautiful looking people twisted minds. Beautiful locations crime crime. Yet, potentially beautiful duality gets repetitive tedious. And hadn't guessed already, director duo given scope fix third go. Yes, I know why, I still hope. Maybe I hope day Saif Ali Khan Anil Kapoor wake stupor want deliver quality products capable producing.
