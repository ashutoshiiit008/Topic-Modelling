The sun shines city's landmarks makes look even prettier. And know YRF movie. Albeit time, see ruggedness city too. You also awe restraint. 15-20 minutes mention foreign location. Another 5 minutes background music still background. Wow! 10 minutes might want pinch Shah Rukh Khan hasn't yet done annoying thing eyebrow lips. And...the spell breaks. Bring accordion, loud chatter, self-referencing, all. We missing you. There three two-and-a-half characters here, Surendra, wife Tani friend Bobby. Yes, back-story barebones even less. This leaves room crux relationship. "L-O-V-E". And thankfully goes couple layers deep. It takes world twosome got married without really knowing other. What takes two decent human beings make work stick out. The sacrifices one makes form changes persona lead claustrophobia. Just like frustratingly boring extrovert convert introvert, really acceptable shy person bubbly enthusiasm permanent feature. These subtle issues need delicate treatment. And starts real trouble. The timid Surendra, attempt please Tani transforms bright gold yellow creature, called - else - Raj. Why? Can exact opposite personality create impact impress Mrs? Isn't anything between? I'm even interested missing 'how', 'why' hasn't stopped bothering yet. We star amongst us needs keep everyone pleased. In name versatility, character HAS make diagonally opposite change. Actually, I begun enjoy Shah Rukh's performance middle-class government servant, Surendra Sahni, minor twitches eye movements suddenly transfigured badly-dressed Shah Rukh Khan - eyebrow curled, whispering romantic inanities, piling inconsistent accent waiting someone grant permission start stutt-stutt-stuttering. Many thanks whoever said NO! The story Surendra wife. Why Vinay Pathak playing Surendra's friend, devil's advocate, supposed "inner voice"? His character especially redundant given Surendra alter-ego own. There wasn't enough room Vinay maneuver around yet make over-the-top acting look adorable. Surendra's lady love, Tani, played Anushka Sharma seems like 'single-expression' training form YRF's-Aishwarya-Rai school non-acting. The expressions taken care drop glycerin. The role women movies like cleverly written. She's center plot protagonist, alter-ego friend care her, adore her, love her. But, lady's part ever-so sketchily written. What know her? Are made part confusion? Do know makes one decision other? No! And thus I resign roles written give us feeling it's woman. And climax too...well...let's say movie male-chauvinistic touch. Also, newly married couple lives socio-economic vacuum. They social pressures. In heart Amritsar, married woman dances prances 'stranger'. Sure token office mates, see one Panjabi family two members - husband-ji wife-ji transformed husband-ji. And yet, take chill-pill watch kind movies. The facets utopian arranged marriage rab ne bana di jodi touches upon intriguing. I wonder much can't identify arrangement appreciate it, makers bothered deserves extra credit. What hurts smart enough hit upon particular nuances, monkey around much rest movie? Songs: Anything music review would place songs movie. So, I'm attaching end like song end credits. Songs always lyrics me. And I look forward Jaideep Sahni's play words. I call list-maker industry. His lyrics usually form lists. As boring sounds, usually interesting observations. The ill-placed song "hum hai rahi pyar ke" beautiful tweaking phrases/songs/names Hindi movies. It delightful picturization guest appearances too. It would worked much better award show performance. The rest ho-hum - lyrics, music, picturization, costumes, etc.
