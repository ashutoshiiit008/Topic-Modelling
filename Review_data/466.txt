It's warm, it's cuddly, it's adorable, it's telling truth disclaimer beginning - it's fictional. Obviously, characters like Aditya Kashyap Geet exist imagination. But used letting go need "resemblance reality". And begin identify emotions playing screen moment, even though character whole pretty unreal. Life unambiguous black white. Everything crystal clear. My problem stories usually begins people transition black white (or vice versa) without going gray. Here, irritates, nags, soon enough dialogues sheer charm actors playing characters take away thinking much it. The dialogues fresh feel them. They outright funny times quite perceptive others. And hardly ever mundane (except one given Dara Singh!). What I found interesting that, whether comic thoughtful, believable. It must sort art form actually make use Kareena Kapoor's over-capacity bubble sparkle - it's well woven story. I always liked way eyes express character's sorrow. But, movies I watched far, usually glimpse, flicker. Here however, retains tone impressively longer time. It also great see Shaheed Kapoor get chance show maturity actor. As clich√©d events might turn be, don't want character hurt. How escapist cinema survive without song dance? We plenty foot-tapping numbers fresh lyrics. The visualization songs also done well. Especially, "tumse hi" - makes really believe characters love. The length movie works it. The average runtime movie recent times two hours. There good reason stay extra 20-25 minutes, without fidgeting. And case, spectacular cause hold me. Tarun Arora's (Anshuman's) sequences handled rather shabbily - almost intentionally ignored audience empathize him. They cut bare minimum. And Dara Singh absolutely, totally, completely avoidable - aspects - relevance story, line(s) given him, way delivers them. While watching movie, various points which, I wanted script take unexpected turn. A turn would make little substantial "time-pass". But, be. It's silly, it's mushy-mushy, it's taken seriously - it's perfect date movie. No more, less.
