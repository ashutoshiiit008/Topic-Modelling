Ever since I saw trailer The Iron Lady, I couldn’t imagine anyone else Meryl Streep play Margaret Thatcher. In head, whatever little knowledge I politician, I thought brilliant casting, get someone able Streep play ambivalent character hers. This thought stayed I walked watching film. I struggled place Thatcher’s real face. All I could think of, one shot Streep Thatcher husband Denis Thatcher (played Jim Broadbent), stand behind podium, dressed blue, hands held together victory. Streep sold visual picture. Using flashbacks main narrative device, The Iron Lady traces Thatcher’s journey unknown British woman went oxford, slowly, course marriage twins, finds way politics. We whisk accomplishments, series montages. We also periodically keep intercutting present day, see older Thatcher, battling dementia, make-believe conversations. We shown flashbacks courtship days husband, archival footage British political past. It’s slow progression however; one necessarily follows particular motif. The biggest problem The Iron Lady absence direction script. The film attempts capture Thatcher’s life 2 hours, case every biopic, flavour necessary; popularly known peg. We shown involvements major historical events (A war Argentina, invasion Falkland Islands, etc). But goes wrong flat, lifeless portrayal. The graph political career would interesting shown impact professional accomplishments psyche, loved mostly rivals. No character paid attention to, Streep gives performance year. While Jim Broadbent Dennis Thatcher gripping, Streep clear show-stealer. She takes voice, accent, demeanor, powerful-eyes Thatcher – film nothing else going itself. She captures confusion nuances person suffering dementia perfectly, you’re able sit awe intercut glimpses longstanding political career. The Iron Lady would much impactful film script managed hold interest. Instead, end getting confused tone film, message wants convey. It merely document dull facts played one another, use flashbacks justified. Was Oscar worth it, question film cannot answer. Streep given powerful performance, film doesn’t bind together – I personally prefer The Devil Wears Prada. Watch The Iron Lady Meryl Streep alone, though miss one, won’t really missing anything.
