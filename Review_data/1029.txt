Has ever happened overhear strange conversation, somehow even though defies every sense logic, words make absolute sense you? For example, “We meant meant other. It’s contradiction”. I know understand line – Woody Allen knows too. Vicky Cristina Barcelona one film helps us understand alone chasms strange thought. As Woody Allen norm goes, Vicky Cristina Barcelona character heavy-film. It stands apart regular treatment films, however, mood tone portrayed neurotic dialogues scenic surroundings lend flavour spirit film. In film, Allen used Barcelona Spanish country-side additional character, lending perspective. The film begins two friends, Vicky Cristina, holiday Barcelona. They complete opposites – Vicky (Rebecca Hall) disciplined organized, Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) free-spirit. On whim, decide take upon Juan Antonio’s (Javier Bardem, plays local painter) offer joining weekend self-indulgence (wine, conversation hours going-with-the-flow). Through journey interactions, see extravagances restraints, discoveries ignorance. All come concoction mood-setting (lighting landscape cinematography), performances depend gaze facial expression dialogue beautiful flamenco background music gives sense freedom. A free-spirit Allen director allowed characters experience film. The film picks pace entry Juan Antonio’s ex-wife Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz). Maria Elena character bit contradiction – she’s easily neurotic lot, yet silence conveys much words. There scene film, taken top angle, shows furiously working canvas, wearing torn piece cloth cover her. She moves one stroke another absolute silent passion. To me, scene describes character best, makes apparent virtue mere presence, she’s star film. The film’s high point interactions; singular character’s interactions city visuals, interactions art photography, interactions one another. Each one lends different perspective viewer Allen knows exactly include words/dialogue seal scene – like perfect package leaves ever-lasting imprint head. The DVD Vicky Cristina Barcelona doesn’t extras, I tell don’t need any. Calling sensual film explores various possibilities visual medium would understatement. Vicky Cristina Barcelona plays – it’s film education, characters indulge, discover, learn portray. Surely you’d want part education.
