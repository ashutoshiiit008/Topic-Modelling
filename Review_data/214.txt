I love well-made romantic comedies, I sucked many romantic tragedies. But comedy becomes tragedy fresh comedy turns clichéd tragedy, it's disappointing. True, I didn't think Cocktail would great. In sense delivers promised. But, problem gives hope beginning falters falls great thump towards end. The good thing though Cocktail never lets go emotions stirred - within characters thus feel audience too. If only, let go generic love triangle towards end. You introduced abla naari (damsel distress) Meera (Diana Penty), self-acclaimed cheesy, flirtoholic Gautam (Saif Ali Khan) one could pass alcoholic, Veronica (Deepika Padukone). Veronica, define character brought bang, especially compared background music free introductory tracks Meera Gautam. The pace happens regular cut-chop-done mode either. It eases like stay chemistry brews fun freshness makes much-needed therapists other. Unfortunately, film progresses see little depth accorded Gautam soon starts coming across shuttlecock long rally. In contrast, female protagonists seem holding dilemmas yet plummet regular predictable outcome lady leads destined – wanting nothing else man. Yep, maybe love indeed makes girls behave like girls – forlorn, beyond logic turns finest stereotypical whiners. Yet, I enjoyed supposed nastiness attached Veronica much like namesake Archie comics (except protagonist seems Reggie Archie). She carries palpable loneliness within drowns chaos loud pubs. Deepika Padukone great carrying various emotions without necessarily spoon-fed. Even scene looks out-of-sorts trying seduce man, see she's getting right after. Similarly, Diana Penty, demure desi town puts forth dilemma, suppressed angst life shaped great warmth. But smart, independent women fall head-over-heels love obnoxious over-the-top charmer wonder two beautiful characters drowned inanity. Saif Ali Khan looks least five years older made be. That besides goes overboard Gautam's cockiness. As intentional might been, doesn't make root Gautam dilemma comes across silly immature. It's women like 'these' can't fall love men like 'that' - it's love, anything happen - I asked give writers characters benefit doubt? Why can't I see it? I like women enough I want get want, I don't see want want. Then come many quibbles. Not resorting needless backstory one thing, vivacious Veronica friends Meera Gautam quite another. These things distract believability story. On hand, backstory offered way Gautam's mom (Dimple Kapadia) uncle (Boman Irani) make wish wasn't offered. Their characters mere pawns making story make twist turns ever-so-blah. Not mention two awesome actors made play loud, meatless characters. Similarly, Meera's husband's (Randeep Hooda) track also avoidable thus saving lot precious screentime. It left threesome pull through. They manage bit actors script fallen prey standard terms conditions. No experimentation, risks, gut.
