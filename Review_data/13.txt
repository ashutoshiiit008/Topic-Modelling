Ritu Sarin Tenzing Sonam’s documentary When Hari Got Married simple unassuming film follows 30-year old taxi driver Hari lead arranged marriage. While film warm heart, I’m still grappling whether I want recommend film not. Hari set marry young girl named Suman. Though couple doesn’t ever get chance spend time together prior marriage, Hari manages get hold Suman’s phone number. Thus ensuring least level ‘courtship’. The phone conversations Hari Suman Hari’s narration experiences goes wedding preparations make smile. Hari resourceful smart, yes. But also simpleton, almost naïve. (Then again, naivety may urban writer’s perception him, based nuggets life captured video.) As film follows Hari acquaint uncomplicated worldview, see traditional India still is. In fact, traditionalism conservativeness apart, comes film deep gender biases penetrated society. Suman, example, properly sets eyes Hari first time actually getting married him. It endearing little heart-breaking think diminutive little woman getting ready spend life man wouldn’t recognize unless pointed her. Even Hari, good man doubt, still seems think wedding ordeal man woman. He gives air someone accept burden anything else. And isn’t fault really; surroundings comes from. Credit, then, filmmakers Sarin Sonam, don’t try milk story sensationalism highlighting burning issues plaguing small-town India. Their focus Hari wedding, everything else flavour texture goes place culture film set. The film, then, like wedding video anything else. And that, primarily, causes unsure much I recommend film. It honest, endearing mature, one truly take away film, apart fact know Hari Suman arranged marriage? Little else, honest. Personally speaking, though, I’m glad I know existence Hari, Suman angelic daughter somewhere hills Dharamsala; find place prayers henceforth.
