A father business partner egg daughter get rich relative's son attracted her. It sounds sleazier say Hindi. A mother today's day age, lived Australia years together doesn't consider asking son likes girl chosen giving word girl's family. Even people exist real life, makes interesting? Why would I want watch them? I didn't like back 90s, I can't stand now. Even so, Ramaiya Vastavaiya manage bring smile, laughs even, Girish Kumar buffoonery. He brings childlike cuteness character, Ram. The kind cutesy behaviour pretty annoying adult it, Girish Kumar carries quite times. And course, times doesn't work all. Unfortunately, times pretty much make entire film. Ramaiya Vastavaiya almost continuously trying really hard funny. It goes top, loud unbearable times. There instances lead pairs sidekick's becoming butt jokes. Or another character whose always phone side conversation funny remark another parallel dialogue scene. All though, works gets repetitive thus stops funny. Given situation villains hero's love lady, nothing exciting, marginally interesting Ramaiya Vastavaiya one villain, supposedly powerful personalities. So, feel hero getting cornered sides. But, what's point intimidating one backs off, like that. Not even courtesy couple lines lectured transform take. The problem love stories like Ramaiya Vastavaiya fail convince undying love lead pair feels other. It like asked believe much love rather feeling it. So, going root for? Certainly woman can't watch even life stake. Shruti Haasan damsel-in-distress works much stereotypical damsel-in-distress would work. It's disheartening see film mimics films made 90s. Especially, feel ones 90s shouldn't made first place!
