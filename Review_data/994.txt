“The purest form cinema life.” – Anonymous If there’s one film recent times underlines statement above, Gajendra Ahire’s Touring Talkies. An honest, heartfelt pertinent movie movies, Ahire’s latest kind film make anyone loves cinema shed tear, sake love it. From thriving business way cinema consumed India commercially early 20th century, touring talkies extinct; alive certain pockets rural India, barely so. Gajendra Ahire shows us peek lives whose livelihoods still depend setting makeshift tents projecting film inside night, leading existence nomads day. He telling us story Chandi, woman infinite energy, unfortunately unfairly come become man’s world. In showing us Chandi’s journey, Ahire shows us life; shows us cinema mirrors society never way around; shows us cinema exists even camera not. Because, see, cinema exists beating heart basest primal emotions, irrespective presence lack observer. But Chandi’s life observer, form filmmaker Mumbai, initially enters life wants film, acclaimed festival circuit, screened touring talkies. The enterprising Chandi also bit cinema expert, manner understands concept fact life drives it. She understands art cinema, well commerce. She seems understand even commercial cinema derived art form, even artistic cinema needs sold. And watch gently rib one big commercial successes recent times, one made tons money despite bad was. With beautiful little touches, Ahire shows us much Chandi loves cinema, so, reminds us much love cinema well. Touring talkies dying, looks it, Internet may end killing conventional brick-and-mortar cinema halls well. But cinema live on, matter what. Yes, screenplay film needed tighter, weightier, I may say so. It meanders bit, tends sag slightly, odd implausible turn. We also never fully see filmmaker, Avinash, embarks emotionally intense journey touring talkie, puts life backburner part someone else’s. Love cinema, perhaps; needed written stronger. But maturity Gajendra Ahire directs, overshadows flaws writing. In fact, Ahire easily one mature filmmakers India currently. The manner frames composes shots, shot scene conveys; everything filmmaking shows maturity understanding art science cinema. Even technically, film holds own. Amol Gole’s cinematography top notch; wonderful earthy colour palette brings frames alive. Also, hat-off maestro Ilaiyaraja’s music background score. Once again, shows understand scene needs musically better him. It lively electric required, subtly haunting need arises. I didn’t particularly understand need English lyrics songs, then, perhaps reflective personality Avinash – English-speaking, city-bred filmmaker almost European sensibilities comes outlook towards cinema. The throbbing, pulsating heart film Trupti Bhoir’s performance Chandi. She sheds inhibitions, exhibits look female leads cinema would dare, pumps Chandi. She livewire, literally lives character. Subodh Bhave Avinash well, always. He look like bit misfit times, pleasing presence makes it. Kishor Kadam Milind Shinde supporting roles don’t much do, two always seem get skin characters play, well. Quite like Martin Scorsese’s Hugo love letter movies, Touring Talkies Gajendra Ahire. It film needs seen many reasons, important one sheer passion cinema, understand sound whirring projector means us. Watch Touring Talkies big screen, respect medium disrespected misused. Perhaps you’ll see why, us, cinema life, life cinema.
