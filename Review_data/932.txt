The Green Hornet radio show back 1930s, later translated comic book series, television series movie. When concept working well audiences many variants decades, you’d think real hard screw technology disposal. This film almost manages amaze that. ‘Almost’ key-word here, still good fun-filled mindless action movie, nowhere near awesome forms franchise. After The Incredibles, plenty flicks experimented superhero concept. Some successful (Kick-Ass, Megamind, etc) others miserably failed (Epic Movie, Underdog, etc). The Green Hornet lies somewhere Seth Rogen Brett Reid, a.k.a The Green Hornet, egocentric cocky billionaire daddy issues hero complex (sounds familiar?) fits pop-culture superhero perfectly; hand Jay Chou Kato, faithful partner, hard-work kicking bad guys building weapons, cars, coffee-machines, pretty much everything born superhero. An idiot big mouth kung-fu god, trusted formula success falls little short film. A mundane screenplay under-utilization actors blame. Seth Rogen lead actor, writer producer film. And great power, comes greater screen-time. He movie. I like Seth Rogen, I do, immensely talented actor like Christoph Waltz looker like Cameron Diaz team, ought give time shine too. Cameron totally wasted film little screen time anything meaningful. She makes she’s got though. Christoph Waltz reason, I insist watch film rather let go. The guy powerhouse talent. He’s done excellent job self-conscious psychopathic crime boss. For me, memorable scene movie James Franco cameo (another talented guy). If James longer role, movie would done wonders. Jay Chou Bruce Lee’s shoes fill in, played Kato television series. Needless say pretty-darn big near impossible shoes fill in. He respectable job though, awesome action sequences. But I’m fan red-eye thing they’ve inserted every action sequence. Sometimes technology works you. Michel Gondry (director) could done much better job. Music score film great. Soundtrack many songs I grew listening to. Its good action flick enough comic moments satisfy you. But nothing much remember by. Watch DVD sure.
