I completely relished sweet time taken establish little Tahaan's innocence harsh environment. I got fairly involved conflict gradually created he's surrounded people taking advantage 8-year old's gullibility. All build-up towards 5-minute climax? So sudden en, people might've fallen asleep slow pace thus far, might even miss climax. Yet, didn't take anything away heart-warming performance Purav Bhandare (Tahaan). The earnestness eyes combination character's zeal inescapable. I've become used seeing Anupam Kher loud comedies, non-slapstick seems like huge step right direction. So, though best, it's certainly one makes voice modulation he's capable of. This first time I've seen Rahul Bose play non-city-bred character. In fact, plays village fool, village fool. I'm still debating whether it's conditioned see doesn't seem convincing indeed role couldn't carry. Any way, actor director need complimented experimentation. Sarika's grief-stricken eyes left completely awestruck. And cinematography. Kashmir's Pahalgam - first time I saw snow fell love it. Looks beautiful now, then. Only houses look rundown, people seem poorer done best maintain warmth inside. I guess visitors think twice consider vacation Kashmir, children play military-terrorist broken cricket bats. It might fiction; might based non-fictional situations. Either way, it's believable. Is easy plant bombs? Or film-maker's way telling people Kashmir, "look you're children" So, I give weightage - disappointment story loses way beautiful photography? Why seem like cinematographer Santosh Sivan took reigns writer Santosh Sivan? But, director Santosh Sivan seems done well actors, folk-based background score, art work, styling, photography, course. Was aim show condition Kashmir narrate story brave boy? Maybe one other. Full points former little dissatisfaction latter. I'd give extra point serenity one enjoyed big screen.
