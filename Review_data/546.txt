Sincere aplogies. To writer, director, actors apprehensive Lafangey Parindey. I made promo-based assumptions completely off. And boy, I glad!! It argued I liked film theories thrown window. What's done done. I came theater shaking head disapproval climax generally happy feeling. And that's score stands. Lafangey Parindey course, to-the-core love story. And absolutely nothing extraordinary one-line plot anyone would use describe it. The climax forgone conclusion. Also like basic seven stories exist world, itâ€™s characters get are, ups downs matter. Lafangey Parindey engaged made care protagonists. In fact, even couple side characters (Nina Faizal) got interested. Lafangey Parindey fairytale appropriate dose villains, witches simplified-real-life little world. The main characters shades grey, make little interesting commonplace Jack Jill. The villain bad doesn't go all-out soft either. Each characters get I call, "presence mind" dialogues - natural, use everyday language, common-man wit lieu filmy-wit. Like sudden expected character-transitions masked smart line two - like mom doesn't believe daughter's aspirations suddenly calls daughter phataakaa she's successful. Some details writing give nice touch second layer film. With overt statement character person look aspire like, covert line pointing fact none "role models" remain person used be. It's disheartening climax major let-down. The signs start showing post-interval, nosedive blah last 15-minutes came shocker. Or way catching us off-guard :)? What sudden rush wrap up? Anyway, characters engage that's film connects you. Our hero, Nandu played Neil Nitin Mukesh, could easily passed 'chocolate boy.' But, writers recognize grown-up audience needs filmi heroes that. So, once, Mumbai milieu chosen add Nandu's character make palatable (too-sweet leads diabetics after). And sort-of, kind-of works. Neil range expressions, really well - confusion, awe, guilt, he's keeping secret, more. Outside though, face frozen. His body doesn't move much anyways. Also, range fits Nandu's character - he's hunk slums, uses muscle adrenaline rush makes money too. He hasn't given future thought, go boxing fighter bar bouncer girlfriend wants be, apparently swiftly. Don't get wrong, entirely illogical, out-of -the-blue. It gradual, attempt made indicate motivation, albeit entirely convincing. Under 'not entirely convincing' headline also 'Deepika Padukone tapori-world. Like I mentioned preview, tight backbone, long mane, stance general give away she's really girl lives lousy life. But makes for, let's make - tries make attitude. Her character strong girl won't take 'no' answer even Almighty. Yep! A proper mainstream movie made ad-film maker leading production house beefy role lead-lady. She entire range ups downs too. I wouldn't imagined Deepika-Neil pair. Somehow, together look like aunties weddings might choose say marrying couple, "He doesn't suit her" vice versa. But, mainly Deepika's performance, seem connected want live happily ever after. The side characters mix. You Kay Kay Menon entering exiting role owns place - hero's self-appointed caretaker (His make-up also awesome.) And unbelievable heroine's brother soul mind. Also, second half unnecessarily shows couple caricatured characters. The frames way edited make Lafangey Parindey look really slick. The music contemporary likable. The songs choreographed soul regular 1-2-3 jerks. The action, especially bike-thrills spell - DO NOT TRY AT HOME. And story general also, "NOT TRIED AT HOME" real world doesn't work way. But along laugh-out-loud moments warm, human story inside. So, like might considered non-conforming dislike new wave cinema considered out-of-fashion like Lafangey Parindey is?
