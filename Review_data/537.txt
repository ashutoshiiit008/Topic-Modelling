Remember friend yours? The one forced watching crappy movie didn’t want go all? Perfect time revenge – praise one send him/her movie. Of course, still figure way keep it. The tag-line reads - Why boys fun? The fun story-writer could imagine girls involved either talking men getting man unattached girl. But obviously, fun thing get various types beauty treatments. Someone needs better exposure girls!!! It’s sad realize actresses agreed portray gender light. The story starts good pace three friends (Rekha, Vasundhara Das, Kim Sharma) wanting find fourth one (Mahima Choudhary) groom. It finishes trying make feel sorry Rekha’s selfish character four failed marriages. The second half like car driving uphill fourth gear. How travels first second something live without watching. I sure whether gorgeous Rekha “needs” not. What I certain though, “should” movies. We thank director letting second half plays darker shades character. But little late. Also, took far let long, making boring. Though I reservations use ‘din dhal jaaye’ (the classic Guide) particular scene, Rekha sung beautifully. Yes, read right, lady sing! And always seduce. That too, fully-clad – full-sleeve blouse, sari, et al. Compared barely-clad women could hardly deliver dialogue, let alone successfully seduce. The technical values – dubbing, music, make-up, cinematography (half movie looked like shot focus), dialogues (five half-funny lines don’t count). First half – loud, second half – sermonizing, whole movie - pointless: doesn’t quite work audience wants entertained. Oh, way, also make sure friend talking read review.
