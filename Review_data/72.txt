The on-screen activity entire theater splits! People around couldn't stop laughing guts out. So funny find jokes situations gags kept happy unnecessary emotional scenes too. No-no, audience chuckling characters, them. I - well I didn't see humor film. Somehow - hit-the-crotch, eunuchs-exist-that's-so-funny, Draupadi-like-undrape-Sari, people-falling-off-stairs, slapping-each-other, modified-cake-fights - don't even make smile, smirk maybe, nowhere near grin-region. However, I laughed jokes, I laughed real hard. I don't understand what's weird whacky Prem (Ranbir Kapoor) style love. Nor I understand what's unusual story. Not crime far, even claim things title. The onus originality entire industry "referencing." But get way wholesome entertaining. The sure way howlarious dialogue, especially don't much terms character arcs story development going on. That manage fits spurts. There another way enjoy do, pre-decide, going enjoy, might too. The lead pair another thing might keep going. Ranbir Kapoor plays perfect Prem (Barjatya reference uninitiated). Charming saccharine sweet. He shades Sunil, tries evoke Prem's darker side. Yes, he's aaawww-cho-chwweet. Diabetics might want stay away. There's one sequence Jim Cary lá The Mask pretty hilarious too. Now, he's that, don’t ask! And oh yeah, remember slapstick? Yes, Ranbir loud one! Boys, Katrina Kaif lovely, look at, ever - even though she's Sunday-Morning-Mass dresses film. Meaning - much terms sensuous skin-show. She doesn't let affect performance though. Same ol' accent, straight face, similar ol' attempt shedding glycerin tears. On brighter side, there's first half-second half syndrome here. It one continuum - emotional scenes, good laughs, loads slapstick, mucho silliness. Oh yeah… 2-3 songs. The problem these, find Santoshi trying imitate movie director. And not, right? Especially pay tribute Cinema Paradiso Maine Pyaar Kiya one go! And anyone else, there's always annoying self-reference bank on. Reminding us could been. It's Tom Jerry style humor, alright. But, doesn't quarter recall value. And saddest part it's desperate effort repeat performance Rajkumar Santoshi. And part pretty obvious. If wasn't difficult. A wannabe Andaz Apna Apna. And successful that.
