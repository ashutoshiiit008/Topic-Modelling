The first half hil-larious! There really funny lines situations second half too, compulsion story breaks flow. Nevertheless, laughs perfect medicine horrible cold. Yeah-yeah, I know illness mind making movie, thought I’d let know I felt like it. Just like, writer threw special effects, stand social issues. Comedies like bring dependencies dialogues comic timing. The great performances wouldn’t mean anything without witty lines. And always, funny lines cannot tickle delivered right. Someone please tell me, don’t real radio jockeys speak sensibly? It’s serious parts (mostly first half hour interval) things drag. They gel general tone all. The side-side story driver place too. And preachy tone end – Why? Why?? Why??? Also, screenplay slacken second half. Acting one exactly characters demand. Yes, even Amisha Patel! When I first heard playing loud character, I dreading time I would see movie. But, restraint comes pleasant surprise. There many artistes name here, everyone done roles full justice. And costumes least people. I really kicked geek almost always dressed solid-colored collared T-shirt. Most characters idiosyncrasies dealt fair hand. I especially liked sexual orientation characters handled sans usual snickers associated issues Hindi movies. A whole range honeymooners covered here, chauvinist interested photography wife couple use camera, arranged marriage love marriages. While characters consistent, leave questions. Since, discussing would give little I like, check details section (spoilers there!). The songs look better sound. They kind grow seen them. The choreography “pyar ki ek kahaani” absolutely breathtaking. This movie Hrishikesh Mukherjee feel it. And says lot coming huge Hrishi-da fan. This certainly kind light movie needed series serious movies seen last four weeks. If only, Reema Kagti worried much trying squeeze actual story every couple.
