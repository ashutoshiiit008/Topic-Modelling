"If only...", "Just this..." I'll happy ever after. Until I come next "if only..." Sirf based human aspect restricting man-woman relationship. Now only, little better execution. Or maybe needed little shorter. Sirf uses four couples different income strata age groups display strife every couple may go phase relationship. While premise interesting held together decent enough story, events narrated plainly story falls apart end. Everyday problems improbable closures. Sirf takes good 40-50 minutes introduce eight main characters. It starts problems could similar ones I someone know closely faced. That mean identify characters, strangely don't. It feels like listening not-so-close friend ramble problems trying best least look interested. And time stage set things take unconvincing turns story gets hands get interested originally were...not. And beyond story, there's nothing much appreciate. I understand lack choice terms actors due budget constraints. But complaint director utilizing already board. At least four eight actors known performances - Kay Kay Menon, Ranvir Shorey, Sonali Kulkarni, Parvin Dabas - yet don't identify sympathize them. Also, rest cast starts really well make believe might treat, na-a-ah. In fact, Rituparna Sengupta suddenly turns serious character comic relief. You don't know look goes most-annoying, supposedly-funny crying bout. Itâ€™s writer/director hasn't tried. He tries terms connecting four stories tries add layers too. For example, I really liked tries show younger couple learning experienced ones. I appreciate attempt trying balance things good bad urbania. But then, done before, could well left behind. In trying much, nothing achieved. That main undoing. Sirf doesn't focus. It doesn't know whether wants serious comedy. It doesn't know whether wants make point commercial material fit somehow (example: misplaced songs lackluster don't serve purpose anyway). At end 2-plus hours, I two minds too. Whether spend time film writing review not. Sense duty beckoned. I watched film satellite TV.
