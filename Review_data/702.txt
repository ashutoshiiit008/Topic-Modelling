The tagline film says "The unbearable lightness being", lovely book Milan Kundera. But, I couldn't figure relates film. All I make superficial observation - anything light. The film starts child-star's mom devil-incarnate. And one more. Now, moms absorbed need live vicariously imposing aspirations children. So absorbed willing sacrifice child's sexuality, also sexual orientation. The focus though mental trauma child goes through. Ominous stuff this. Enough say aloud, "can please stop this? NOWâ€¦" The hallucinations lead character going surreal supposedly reality. There certainly deeper layers way subject approached exhibited didn't leave interested enough think it. This lot theatrical performances. The actions-reactions looked staged. Ironically works Bipasha Basu's favor. She looks gorgeous plays enigmatic dream-girl really well. The grainy look feel - maybe intentional, maybe budget-induced, maybe - also works towards unnerving audience.
