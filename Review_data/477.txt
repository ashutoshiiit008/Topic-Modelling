I wonder college Shaad Ali went to…either studied abroad, hasn’t made college all! Because gone conventional desi college, would certainly known play game ‘spin yarn’ effectively. Shaad disappointed encashing opportunity mighty Yash Raj banner presented him. Patchy storyline, lackadaisical screenplay overdose theatrics completely killed movie. Add great music score Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, half-baked, mediocre chitrahaar called Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. The saving grace movie comes Aki Narula, Costume designer Abhishek Bachchan actor (in order). The costume donned Big B quite impressive, distinct look given Abhishek; though I wonder Amitabh would done role son movie. Lara Dutta gives steady performance, Zinta babe Deol puttar clearly par. A word Abhishek’s performance: shown remarkable comic timing doesn’t look wooden anymore facial expression dance movements. His look well worked sad poor direction poorer story would deny adulations would otherwise received. Ayananka Bose, Cinematographer done steady job, simply can’t opt movie Cinematography. Of late, plethora movies showing Western locales (KANK, Ta Ra Rum Pum, Cheeni Kum) therefore isn’t novelty left way foreign locales picturized. So never mind Eiffel Tower Waterloo station indeed pride Taj Mahal, would miss much give movie skip. Shaad Ali’s fetish Taj though leaves stale taste mouth…apart ‘Taj Sale’ sequence Bunty aur Babli (where present-day UP’s CM Mayawati lampooned Phoolsakhiji), picturized ‘Chup Chupke-2, chori se chori’ song using Taj backdrop. In JBJ too, reasonably long (and therefore irritating) sequence picturized, using portions song ‘Bol Na halke halke’ well. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy largely disappointed, barring title track mellifluous ‘Bol Na halke halke’ (rendered Rahat Fateh Ali & Mahalaxmi Iyer), tracks sound monotonous jarring. The Editing Ritesh Soni OK, barring climax, isn’t great. Vaibhavi Merchant’s Choreography also fetches pass marks, rather disappointing scope tremendous. She given repetitive steps Abhishek, avoidable. Worse still, made good dancer (Bobby Deol) look average. I wonder done deliberately behest powerful Bachchans, like Big B made look weak dancer K3G’s ‘Shaava Shaava’ Farah Khan behest Shah Rukh Khan. In nutshell, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom David Dhawan type movie watched endorse ‘dimaag nikaal ke dekho’ school thought. Since promos movie leap years ahead full-length stuff, I suggest shouldn’t strain time money flick instead happy promo.
