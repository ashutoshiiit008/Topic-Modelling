Everyone Gyan Correa’s The Good Road lost. But spend second introspecting life might ask yourself, “Do even I really know I am?” The harsh highway Gujarat, then, forms setting stories The Good Road quite likely metaphor life itself. And, character quite rightly says film, many highways India - many lives many stories waiting told. David, Kiran 7-year-old son Aditya young family Mumbai vacation Gujarat. A twist circumstance leads Aditya separated parents, ends traveling Pappu Shaukat - pair truckers bit mission own, speak. Then there’s Poonam, little girl way meet grandmother Athangasa, unfortunately ends exactly little 11-year-old girl must go. The three stories wind around form film’s narrative – simple, sparse tales that, bit bit, reveal little characters voice thoughts apprehensions. Pappu, Shaukat Aditya, instance, develop strange relationship spend time other. Aditya, particular, makes see divisions sense ‘us them’ something truly develop grow older. The innocence child always great leveler – almost never distinguishes two people based exterior factors us adults likely spot. There attempt graph, attempt infusing drama film. Quite like life itself, film trudges along based particular characters believes wants particular moment. This approach lends mature tone The Good Road, though I completely imagine people finding narrative slow good. We India aren’t used films don’t attempt create graph, don’t try creep audience twist two, go characters take them. In sense, The Good Road good example storytelling sake story, sake audience. That said, one can’t help feel relying heavily characters relationships drive story, becomes absolutely imperative every character actually stay character behave character. Many time instances notice characters avoid obvious logical steps take situation, instead something completely counter-intuitive. The screenplay film, then, ends striking many false notes – strange, considering developed one Film Bazaar Screenwriters’ Lab 2008. The film also suffers unimpressive key performances. Ajay Gehi always bit overenthusiastic front camera. Here, David, pretty much thing. Sonali Kulkarni, always manages convey right amount emotion, well, despite small role. Little Keval Katrodia Aditya charms naivety. The real letdown Shamji Dhana Kesaria Pappu. The relationship Pappu develops Aditya heartwarming, doesn’t quite intended effect Kesaria plain expressionless. Priyank Upadhyay, plays sidekick Shaukat, absolute natural, though. Some minor characters appear film supposedly locals made act, rawness shows often. The film, however, benefits immensely sun-bathed landscape Gujarat, lends many poignant frame film. In fact, stark, bare-minimum movement camera works really well tone film, Rather impressing outright gorgeous cinematography, film lets composition frames subjects talking. A special mention must also made sound design. The film actually relies lot sounds create sense place time, often even visuals. There aren’t many pause think this, film almost always good member audience takes experiencing film. If don’t usually watch film second time within days first viewing, try once. I guarantee film look different based state mind. Keeping mind, becomes extremely difficult view The Good Road objective mindset, considering furore selection India’s official entry Academy Awards’ best Foreign Language Film category widespread support, even internationally, The Lunchbox. Still, I’d urge keep mind catching The Good Road DVD. While DVD holds nothing film, love cinema like giving different kinds cinema shot, try one too. Is film better The Lunchbox? Debatable, questions don’t yes-no answer. Is film good enough represent India internationally? Probably not. Will make final Academy Awards shortlist? Almost certainly not. But film worth watch gorgeous visuals sounds, rare maturity storytelling rises issues writing? The honest answer is, “Yes”.
