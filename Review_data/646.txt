Wherever world I’ve lived last 12 years, I proudly called Bombayite/Mumbaikar heart. The city indescribable energy sweeps whenever I’m there. Mumbai Meri Jaan, however, various characters don’t necessarily romanticized view Mumbai. Each goes phase cynicism ultimately accepts situation joins “spirit” city. It’s study characters. Each character interesting, even completely convincing. The combination characters chosen fascinating. The resistance extreme characters obvious. Instead, shade gray picked one variation grays, while, defies believability. Yeah, also one possible interpretation might state mind citizens bomb blasts July 11th, 2006. But, seems secondary. The bomb blasts could well replaced traumatic event Mumbai gone past years. The focus social commentary economic disparity city suffers from, corporatization private lives media, two sides youth wanting migrate abroad, on. Like city, Mumbai Meri Jaan people make is. Even bit roles give glimpse yet another character might find city - spoilt rich brats, sermonizing father, housewives bomb blasts must meant another event, many more. The main characters, course, dealt much details. Nikhil, idealist pays taxes, refuses drain country it’s brain, considers changing whole life around deal trauma blasts bring about. R. Madhavan’s demure yet sure personality smoothly transforms troubled, paranoid Mumbaikar. Rupali, regular brand TV reporter, refuses believe she’s exclusive. You see Soha Ali Khan turn zombie confident, aspirational lady starts as. Thomas good-hearted slum-dweller whose favorite pass-time silently observe rich ways. Irrfan Khan minimal dialogue manages convince us need avenge rich self-imposed redemption thereafter. Suresh, racist, makes everything sees fit conspiracy theory. What person need substantiate argument act terrorism? Suresh’s transformation seems laziest cop-out Kay Kay Menon, like always, gives character body language attitude demands. Tukaram Patil, end working life police officer, symbolizes impotency police department. This clichéd character one weakest ones. Paresh Rawal brings amazing timing mostly well-crafted dialogues. His performance certainly blamed character’s transition “go flow” attitude giving “have better aims, better life” sermons juniors. Any way, one main purposes character seemed thread characters together. The final speech gives seemed rather contrived, especially connection really necessary. Otherwise, dialogues characters charming ruggedness. You know character development means, right? More run-time. And Mumbai Meri Jaan’s biggest drawback, even patient viewer like me. The climax one subtle, yet strongest ones I’ve seen Hindi cinema recent times. Only story tellers taken 20-25 minutes many get there. I wonder much compelling climax would’ve come earlier, audience time get bored. Albeit tongue-in-cheek supremely clever, there’s undercurrent sarcasm running movie. This sarcasm points big fat finger indifference people towards others’ trauma. Now, taking cue title, people Mumbai. Sure, climax serves consolation digs taken Bombayites ultimately balances tables. But, effort make unbiased possible unmistakable. And that, despite love Mumbai, I respect story’s comment residents.
