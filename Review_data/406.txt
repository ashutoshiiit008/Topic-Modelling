Had one first thrillers ever, Hijack would've exciting. But, logistical gaps happy coincidences, far, far away making nerves jitter. Not characterizations first priority action thrillers, characters including main ones one mere outlines. Let alone shades add depth, one color chosen them. Especially annoying Priya (Capt. Vikram's daughter) cheerful despite trying circumstances. So strong 8-10 year old smiling way hostel first time even though father can't control tear rolling eye. In movie almost everything mediocre, don't really expect best lines characters. But, airport ground staff spewing philosophy passenger checking bit much. Considering one-line character sketches lame lines, actors seem done decent job smiling scared. The logic logistics writing haphazard. A terrorist gang meticulous planning, gun planted chips packet enter airport reaches fine. But, take flight Amritsar, want go Dubai without thinking fuel replenishment! Not completely bad. There couple subtle scenes add flavor particular sequence. Like little boy fetching phone senior terrorist rugged training center implying children trained too. This scene replaces kids-crawling-under-barbed-wire drill customary showcasing camps. I really wonder purpose served generic lyrics set regular music, picturized aerobic-style choreography? The story certainly doesn't need them. If producer needs commercial success, I certainly hope audience fooled supposed-Brazalian miming Hindi. Hijack 'leave brains behind' kind action-thriller, Just like slapstick kind comedy. Slapsticks donâ€™t make laugh, Hijack neither creative action manages thrill.
