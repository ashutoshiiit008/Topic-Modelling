People take pleasure causing pain others - loads movies/TV shows based characters. The psychos might agenda, wired way. Either way, seasoned, Dexter follower, brutal serial-killers hardly phenomenon. Then I blame sex part sexual violence managed creep out, regardless however experienced I watching trade. Murder 2 reaches primal fear woman me. It might copy another film dozen them, I know not. It might dozen loopholes, boy does! But none matters. Your brain recognizes gaps it's watching film, processing sensations film producing. It can't bothered story details such. I could go "how come knows this?" "why doesn't police that?" But skin crawling fear villain scene one till end, film worked. The film works villain. Now whether Prashant Narayanan Pandey (the character plays), I wouldn't know. They one other. After theater, might analyze it's never clear serial killer confused sexuality and/or ashamed it. You might also realize violence watched wasn't really sexual nature, that's ambience film creates. I wonder made things specific, much trauma would caused nerves. Being person doesn't enjoy "thrill", I could also bear Pandey didn't fit concept serial killer. He isn't neat work isn't careful. But I guess, TV shows films meticulous murderers ones got caught. Murder 2 different aspect too. We know murderer gets caught pretty early film too. He's police custody still fear him. Because saw promos worried sick innocent young girl who's 2-minute backstory makes feel sorry her. It much backstory Sulagna Panigrahi's performance you. Brilliant casting, that. Which reminds Jacqueline Fernandez. Hah! I think Bhatt's brilliant marketing. They know USP, audience really here. They lose time making Jacqueline lose clothes. And done, start actual story. And that's it. She doesn't anything couple steamy scenes. And Emraan Hashmi. Well stuff said scenes, like I said Prashant Narayanan completely chews scenery. Did I enjoy movie? Hell, no. It type. Did achieve purpose? Yep! It kept uneasy throughout. And kind people thrilled kind violence, might work even better. Does make good film? While watching it, yes. But hindsight, see places went wrong wonder much better could been. Anyway, like I always say, would different film though. Ps. If haven't figured yet, one nothing what-so-ever Murder.
