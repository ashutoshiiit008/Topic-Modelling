Treat fairy tale might able sit it. Unfortunately though, target audience likely enjoy it, despite rating I assign it. Through movie kids things usually see adults movies thus entertaining children. The special effects appreciated tribute trying pay Harry Potter, Men Black Matrix movies. However, rather amateurish. The sound effects done over-enthusiastically. The comedy bits best slapstick. The cameraman seems love nauseating 45 degree angle. The song lousy lyrics distinct Baba Saigal feel it. It picturised shabbily too. And top all, print quality isn’t best many sequences. Jackie Shroff’s Johnny Depp-look works well. He done good job used much more, like led believe promos. Also, would nice head chopped cameraman often. The ghost character plays seems defined powers almost anything. But hey, work pure fiction, bind story-writers creativity? The child artists movie given decent balanced performance. It’s adults get nerves over-acting. It extremely annoying actors face audience delivering dialogues actually talking another character movie. I don’t know whether sad happy kids done better job presumed grown-ups. Despite this, I think children going like movie, mainly hardly competition. There hardly non-animated Hindi movies children. What movies released bang middle exam-time?! Anyway, feel good movie children bad characters realize mistakes change ways end. Warning!! The rating target audience! Adults, don't bother, one might okay times need children hair couple hours.
