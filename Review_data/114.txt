Once Aditya Chopra done patting back reminding us he's man behind Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge get back habit looking reference Yash Raj film, story begins emerge. Women strong characters fairly mature portrayal relationships two things Bachna Ae Haseeno surely boast about. Ad: Buy Hindi Bengali DVDs & VCDs Induna.com Falling love almost always random occurrence Hindi movies. You "come...and fall love". But Bachna Ae Haseeno deals complexities process characters led-on betrayed, hurt, long healing process takes, ultimately relationship needs closure. I'm sucker even relatively coherent plots. And I two! Ideally I would ecstatic. But - yeah, obviously there's - itâ€™s overall stories pretty neat novel. The details add pretty bird's eye view stories ordinary. Also, third story hanging around lame begs negative marking. There subtle things blended pretty well story. Raj (Ranbir Kapoor), boy whose focus life woo girl he's Europe, grows person would takes maintain independence. Then smoothly turns mature person who's ready introspect bear burden responsibilities. For tolerate Ranbir's boyish chuckle puppy eyes, though. To fair, glimpses good timing, especially post-interval he's reacting rather center attraction. He boyish charm audience feels him, despite character meanest things people around him. The women, right whole range emotions play around pretty good justice too. Interestingly though, character arc one one play smitten, confident, fun-loving, hurt, vengeful, shrewd point way expressing emotions. So, indignant Minissha looks exactly like indignant Bipasha attitude Bipasha throws around feels similar attitude Deepika wearing. Almost if, briefing given related one character. And yet characters different. So, what's going here? We pretty good performances. Though Deepika's voice doesn't vary much dubbing doesn't match intensity lines said. But I absolutely enjoyed Bipasha's track - both, due acting, way character written. Minissha Lamba's story actually charming lot. The characters general pretty well-detailed. Yet film fails touch absolute terms. For one, structure story episodic. Granted chapter-like feel intentional cut movie sharply 20-25 minute pieces. Individually, pieces don't always work either. The first two pieces fact, feel like set-up actual show. And certainly need better lines "we're abroad, can't miss train" (what even mean!?). Lighting thousand candles wiping smudged kajal (eye make-up) girl's eye somehow don't generate chemistry automatically. The sincerity eye contact, stance body, way two bodies hold missing instances. Even nice human brutally mistreat person wronged them. But mistreatment exaggerated, sole purpose arousing sympathy audience, gets irritating. Ultimately, climax kills otherwise decent plot. It's rushed thus dissatisfying. Aditya Chopra/Siddharth Anand come fairly non-standard (in Hindi cinema) concepts. These concepts revolve around situations urban population mid-late twenties faces. You almost see concerns change years. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge - Dil To Pagal Hai - Hum Tum - Salaam Namaste. And love vs. marriage debate. They take contemporary relatively mature look problems cop out! They literally chicken don't feel bad walking movie. That's sad audience ready take it, now. Then, things like one song half-time picturized Deepika Padukone. No doubt, one typical good-locale-let's-dance-here kinds. But, put context placement styles chosen two songs Minissha Bipasha, figure without purpose, much line subtext story relates male lead character feels women.
