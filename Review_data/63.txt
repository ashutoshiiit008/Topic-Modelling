No recent film highlights importance context baggage film received M. Night Shyamalan’s After Earth. If wasn’t enough director fire previous debacles like The Last Airbender, After Earth produced story written Will Smith, Hollywood superstar playing one two lead characters, son Jaden Smith essaying – larger-than-life sci-fi father-son story. Then reports much put making film large franchise, one restricted cinema. Needless say, film perceived gloated, indulgent vanity affair, near-universally panned release earlier year. There’s doubt involved making film largely blame negative vibes film around. But, I also firmly believe every film deserves least one chance – After Earth, barely received even first chance. Stripped away pre-release buzz, After Earth still plenty flaws, I couldn’t help feeling perhaps world tad harsh it. Most issues After Earth lie suspect screenplay, cast loses bit actual performance gains screen presence, inconsistent VFX – good places, amateurish others. Despite flaws, though, film isn’t entirely unwatchable. It is, all, father-son reconciliation story well coming age tale young boy, set hostile future world. These themes always find measure resonance even made inexperienced filmmakers – one hardly call Shyamalan that. Couple adventure action elements run-time 100 minutes, After Earth isn’t entirely waste time. Will Smith plays Cyper Raige – legendary soldier retire. His son Kitai Raige trying hard live father’s name, seems end short. Their relationship tested full face danger scarcely imagined. How one wishes Jaden Smith inherited acting skills father. With innocent charm The Pursuit Happyness gone, rely genuine performance make impact After Earth, doesn’t always succeed endeavour. It doesn’t help father spend screen time away other, communicating wirelessly. He doesn’t advantage Will Smith’s persona rubbing screen – something always happens stars like Smith. The interesting aspect film deals concepts danger fear – former real, latter merely state mind, hence completely avoided. The practical manner forms crux story actually ingenious bit writing. Also, concept planet Earth become uninhabitable hostile towards human beings another original idea holds merit. The film suffers visualization Earth, one usual pitfalls futuristic film – showcasing technology hardly seems make logical sense. The problem After Earth packaged epic. Instead packaged intimate father-son story, epic feel coming naturally, rather forced audience’s throat. The applies DVD well – DVD case different enough usual cases DVDs come packed in, unsuspecting believe film they’re holding hands sort epic. The pack nice, film better. The contents DVD, though, disappointing, bonus features. The DVD three featurettes it, give insight making film. ‘A Father’s Legacy’ takes look Will Jaden screen, thankfully doesn’t get mushy. ‘1000 years 300 Seconds’ rapid behind scenes look film brief, still quite interesting. And lastly, gorgeous locales film shot showcased featurette titled ‘The Nature Future’. Mostly cinephiles, bonus features After Earth DVD certainly let down. Another good touch, I believe must DVDs releasing India, regional languages option. This one comes Hindi, Telugu & Tamil, also option English Hindi subtitles. Because film means ‘must watch’, After Earth DVD hard recommend strongly. However, pure academic interest, discover much way film received viewer depends viewer takes film him, After Earth film one wouldn’t particularly mind catching home video.
