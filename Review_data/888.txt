How one love movie children crafted utmost compassion - children special needs that? But, reason I liked Tare Zameen Par? Maybe - maybe not. What I know sure strong one-line story narrated extremely charmingly. It truly uplifting spirit wins yet, spirit winning. Tare Zameer Par child suffers one around recognizes slow learner. The beauty narration message applies children - learning disability not. How creativity deserve place academics? It also points subtle finger build conformation system right roots. The pace first half gives time think normal children academically inclined. The resolution second half, however, comes quickly compared trauma shown earlier. But, I guess, point show difficulties overcome, don't necessarily want show difficult overcome them. About 45 minutes post-interval, Darsheel Safary (Ishaan) said line made realize hadn't said line last hour so. There I feeling sorry Ishaan, feeling like yelling someone give big hug I fought lump throat longest time. All based solely Darsheel's expressions body language! Kudos director taking decision many brilliant confidence. And, finally dialogue writer knows give actors helping hand. There couple verbose, preachy scenes. But, made point well written. Aamir Khan's entry movie seemed over-the-top forced, mainly absolute contrast tone movie thus far. But little realize can't distinguish actor/director Aamir Khan character Nikhumb. They fighting cause. Passionately. The characters serve purpose caricatures - stereotypical father, loving mother, understanding sibling, ruthless teacher, jeering peers. No matter focus camera is, love feels towards subjects shows frame. And, turn, fall love see screen. Compositions, lighting, angles, colors work successfully together engross often enchant you. The lingering camera might added good 10-15 minutes run-time. But hard-pressed point exact scenes movie could done without. Everything building character atmosphere both. The songs contribute narrative. The lyrics sheer poetry. I know-I know, that's supposed be, can't remember last time lyrics brought tears. "mein kabhi batlaata nahi" kept speechless (and know difficult is!). And rock-style guitar strumming kids' song - that's I call creative. Yes, dash seemingly inevitable melodrama exists. The side-characters transform apparent reason. The climax exaggerated unrealistic could get. However, aim show reality life reality condition child suffers from. Once get that, pardon make-up mother wearing 6 AM chores. And anyway, towards end, time willing forgive. Because, else, makes think. When grow up? When along way forget felt like yelled at, put down, ridiculed? And choose next generation revenge? Will recognize child us struggling get out? Will sensation lump throat created, stay credits roll?
