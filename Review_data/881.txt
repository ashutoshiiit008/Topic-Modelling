A married couple, much love other, pulled playing online reality game along lines The Moment Truth. Interestingly enough, Indian version game, Sacch Ka Saamna hosted hero Table No 21's, Rajeev Khandelwal. Anyway, idea, couple complete task related question answered - truth dare sorts - engaging. Unfortunately, ends much expected topped social message. My concern films social message audience like needs convincing. I'm already story-teller's side issue. The people need watch film one's commit crime. And even watch film like this, would make difference behavior. Even powerful films might effect, Table No 21 isn't even hard-hitting enough. So, what's point? Sorry, talking kind crime question would giving movie away. Table No 21 doesn't come strong enough, despite grueling stuff protagonists/antagonists go through, don't quite connect characters. You know grey that's brilliant thing today's world black white characters Hindi films. Yet, don't feel even going mentally cruel ordeals. Their happiness sorrow seems fake. Some disconnect also seems order tasks pan out. Instead escalating rigorous painful ones. So gone major ordeal couple's dilemma seems fake relatively simpler one comes that. Sure, symbolic tortures others, yet symbolic pain seems artificial. That turn, could functional performances Rajeev Khandelwal Tena Desae. Paresh Rawal trying devilish best, doesn't help. Paresh Rawal's character's sidekick provides unintentional laughter trying look ominous. So, yet another potentially interesting story falls prey mediocre execution. Yet another topic concern country sees film made right intentions lot heart, comes across contrived forced.
