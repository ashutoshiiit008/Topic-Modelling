The complexity situation Pakistan deserves lot attention pop culture types art reach us, people far-removed situation. To portrayed mainstream cinema necessity. To beautifully adapted Shakespearean tragedy luxury I couldn't imagined possible. For land free yet imprisoned like Hamlet describes, Kashmir would one top contenders. The rest departments dedicated topic play fit like jigsaw puzzle. After enamored adaptation Kashmir, next thing stuck Shahid Kapoor's performance. He stands tall bang middle power house performers like Kay Kay Menon Tabu, feat I never would thought capable of. Two sequences stuck memory I see forgiving many Phata Poster Nikla Heros R...Rajkumaars two sequences, one actually dance performance. Another scene completely taken actor, unsurprisingly Irrfan Khan. These sequences lovely examples departments film-making coming together perfect synchronization - story writing, dialogue writing, scene (and dance) choreography, setting course performances. If way incorporate song dance perfectly serious film, way Haider's trick play done. The graveyard song would worked even better flowed film little smoothly. Unfortunately, way film, seems little abrupt instead hitting hard way potential to. Similarly, story linear, back forth builds well, also flattens little half-time. The pace little uneven second half. But, minor quibbles easily forgivable dialogue, performances beauty Kashmir. It must difficult resist temptation setting contrast gorgeousness Kashmir man made it. Blood gore purity white snow. And film set fall winter, even Kashmir spring. After seen films week-after-week knowing many seen there, inspire watch again. And even fewer department played role close perfection. Vishal Bharadwaj's Haider one rare ones. Yes, I certainly watch one again. Soon.
