The big problem Joseph Kosinski’s sophomore feature, sci-fi magnum opus ‘Oblivion’, based graphic novel written Kosinski himself, that, like 2010 debut film TRON: Legacy, focus seems film looks, opposed truly delving deep psyche characters, feel feel way do; fact almost see effort gone making film ‘feel’ like epic. Perhaps day filmmakers realize epics aren’t ‘made’; happen. The film set post-apocalyptic future, one Earth nothing barren wasteland, invasion subsequent war mysterious creatures known ‘Scavengers’; war won, Earth lost. Mankind since developed alternate plan survival, Jack Victoria teammates manning station; they’re mission part plan. Unable shake strong déjà vu number previous sci-fi action films, including The Matrix, Inception, Total Recall Source Code name few, Oblivion still loads potential. The film starts well enough, amidst gorgeous visuals, sepulchral feel intricately enigmatic air created images battered Earth. Also, something poetic vast, endless canvas one man one woman represent life memory means human being. And then, emotional core film - fact memories true love never fully erased matter what; kind thought potential melt even hardened cynics. Unfortunately, instead exploring emotion further, film turns action thriller mystery. Even could actually worked film tight, gripping screenplay back up. The fact events unfold generous almost indulgent pace, pointing fact attempt create modern day classic, weakens film further. One film’s big weaknesses fact soul film, love Tom Cruise’s character Jack, Julia, character played Olga Kurylenko, doesn’t come through; two share chemistry pair wooden blocks. Andrea Riseborough, plays Jack’s partner Victoria, quite lovely, though eventually reduced side character. Morgan Freeman functional, screen make take things little seriously, sometimes. Tom Cruise, I’ve always maintained, one last ‘movie stars’ left. By that, I mean ability make incredulous on-screen goings-on look completely believable; almost lives magic cinema be. This remarkable feature man actually one things doesn’t make Oblivion total waste time. Another undeniable plus point cinematography, year’s Academy Award winner Life Pi, Claudio Miranda. True, film heavily embellished VFX, look beautiful. The third aspect marginally redeems film soundtrack; credited three composers, nervous, edgy heavily orchestral sound often reminiscent Hans Zimmer score, tad over-cooked, nevertheless one stays true genre film. Oblivion eventually amounts lost opportunity; potential epic doesn’t even go close. A majority audience quite happy walk film forget soon after. And yet, thoughts student cinema critiquing cinematic work. Deep down, part believes movies real real life, actually loved Oblivion potential had, even though never fulfills it. I completely immersed indulgence film, haunting feel, sad beautiful frames thriving planet reduced rubble core emotional thought; true love memory worth fighting for, worth dying for. I loved Oblivion, even though offers plenty reasons loved.
