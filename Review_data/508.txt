I couldn't review Khap didn’t release Pune. And looks like I didn't miss much. Thank you, Danish, covering one wogma! - meetu Honestly? Is really difficult make compelling, intelligent movie based inspired real life incidents? ‘Khap’ easily make worthy case study filmmakers set “good intentions” turn serious deep issue giggle worthy melodramatic drivel. So keeping line USP site, I won’t give details plot brief outline. An estranged son, Madhur (Mohnish Behl) works National Human Rights Commission, returns village sixteen years investigate honour killings supposedly carried behest Khap Panchayat. Madhur’s father Omkar Chaudhary (Om Puri) one heads Panchayat father son don’t exactly see eye-to-eye many issues son taking firm stand practice honour killings. So much posturing speeches back & forth “pros & cons” Khap Panchayats honour killings, cinematic co-incidence rears it’s ugly head form Madhur’s daughter, Ria elopes boy gotra. Boy oh boy! Get pitchforks torches ready. Last year Priyadarshan tried tackle similar topic Mississippi Burning Aakrosh made mockery things inserting “credible” sequences Ajay Devgn slides moving train stands atop moving car dodging branches; keeping inherent silliness aside Aakrosh & Khap suffer serious lack research & good writing. Both seem content painting sensationalist picture serious issues depth screenplay movies accords it; characters & situations aren’t credibly fleshed pointless love-songs run amok. I guess kind treatment make wonder “good intentions” makers referring to. I love Khaps ways can’t help find portrayals utterly one-dimensional; sneering, glaring, moustachio-ed, hookah smoking men talk prathas & hamara kanoon. The movie tries overcome problem presenting Om Puri moral dilemma thus setting inevitable cultural transformation. However it’s lecturing back forth characters gets tiresome preachy thus never allowing grow beyond paper-thin clichés; moral one, amoral one, misguided one, turned new leaf one, blood-thirsty one…you see? The romantic track lays waste little chance redemption laid dramatic elements movie. It’s bad & unconvincing almost makes root Khap Panchayat administer whatever punishment deem fit end suffering right away. The camerawork, background score & art direction remind television grade material onus lies solely director Ajai Sinha, man behind TV soaps Hasratein Astitva- Ek Prem Katha. So, brings small-screen sensibilities project, effectively making two-hour pilot future TV series instead feature film. Khap fails every front, it’s ineffective social commentary, it’s overlong preachy (not mention unintentionally funny), it’s saddled love story hope ends soon begins, though I would highly recommend Alok Nath’s little monologue dangers inter-gotra marriages, piece de resistance film might funniest bit cinema might watch year long. What supposed send shiver spine likely tickle funny bone simply put sleep; avoid costs.
