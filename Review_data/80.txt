Squeak. Squeaaaaak. I could save trouble watching movie (and forgive summing review one sentence – PLEASE don’t) letting know Alvin The Chipmunks: Chip wrecked squeaking. The third part decent first movie (Alvin Chipmunks), Chipwrecked takes pop culture references Cast Away Lost, shows Alvin, chipmunks female doppelgangers getting stranded island Dr. Cliche, creating havoc luxury cruise. The chipmunks are, best, ignorable. They could cute would tone squeaks, would they? Chipwrecked moves slapstick adventure, churning chipmunk-ish versions hit songs (Destiny’s Child, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga). It’s one song another one slapstick joke another. With binding ingredient. It’s almost like buffering YouTube videos row. Seriously, there’s nothing story – I almost wish I write. What get however, series annoying, helium-voiced sequences writers Jonathan Aibel Glenn Berger (Of Kung Fu Panda fame). Essentially, Chipwrecked lazy dumb attempt repeat winning performance box-office. While, 1950, Chipmunks known cartoon-based band released helium versions popular songs. I’d want write children given better options festive season movie, much I hate admit, perfect movie children watch. With large tub popcorn, continue revel loud, bratty behavior (so let’s say child isn’t bratty, don’t take him/her this). If you’re adult however, you’re movie theatre bear film, grateful it’s 87 minutes long. Alvin The Chipmunks: Chip wrecked formulaic, predictable, crass extremely obvious in-film branding (Carnival Cruise Line). It’s like producers film sat one evening decided channel money coming – put crucial cinematic elements like plot character-relationships. Take kids picnic instead, weekend getaway. Or sit home watch How Grinch Stole Christmas!, you’d better off.
