Romcoms default fresh feel them. They light fluffy intended make smile exaggeration. In way, Amit Sahni Ki List fits bill perfectly. It also tries different sense it's guy set life seems completely focused finding perfect woman. His search built reasonably well, doesn't hold interest point. A part might Amit Sahni doesn't quite know wants. But again, knows want? In sense, realistic Amit rushing towards side looks greener. My guess is, would fine film unbiased towards Amit pick. The film clearly picked sides wants us believe Amit decision-maker. And film looks like lost advantage. It Amit Sahni represent lost urban youth comes love. That generation thinks knows exactly wants comes life partner, clue push comes shove, also known as, fall love. The pity way film could've ended right. Whatever Amit Sahni would've done, would've dissatisfactory call. Fortunately, performances right ballpark. Vir Das aptly charming confused. Vega Tamotia brand cute character Mala. Anindita Nayar slick, businesswoman bit neatly. Kavi Shastri best lines lot good comic timing pull too. The film tries hand modern annoying trying connect audience. It Amit Sahni's mom speak SMS-ese. So actually talks abbreviations. Then SMS/chat exchanges show screen call bubbles. All slick distracts story, rather blend narrative. It comes across overt. For modernity, Amit Sahni Ki List keep regular traps relationship films. And looks like deliberate attempt. So, couple bond regular fun, filmy things, something natural way behave too. Interestingly, keep sex picture completely. The regular arguments related friends career avoided too. Yet, don't sense chemistry except couple scenes. A lot Amit Sahni breaking fourth wall talking us, quite unnecessarily so. Other that, songs intrusive. I'd like talk specially opening song. The film called Amit Sahni Ki List - film includes male protagonist's name title. It starts woman song lyrics claim women bodies. But visually, like item number fully focused objectifying sexuality. It disturbing. This song looked nothing like trailer, disorienting. I almost wondered I walked wrong screen. Only find indeed nothing film, unabashedly so. The first line film claims producers! I didn't know whether laugh cry. Off late, I similar conundrum respect overall opinion film. I don't like film narrated got conclusion specifically conclusion too. At time, story-wise I can't quite tell would've fairly reasonable change could've made. Maybe even fluffy romcoms, staying within realm exaggeration allowed, started representing life well. Maybe that's doesn't work films - don't take fairyland neither stay real enough identify them.
