Mark Wahlberg suddenly becoming Akshay Kumar Hollywood. The man rather straight face, mouthing absurd, yet funny lines (“I’m peacock! You’ve gotta let fly!”) The way Akki would Priyadarshan film. Wahlberg’s traits work nicely paired Will Ferrell, quintessentially funny man, The Other Guys, film two detectives New York’s police department nothing mundane paperwork existing cases, rather part adrenaline pumping car chases nail criminals like real investigators would. Although Hoitz (Wahlberg) wants go shoot guns like real cops do, struggles inspire geeky desk partner Gamble (Ferrell) rise occasion together, become city’s heroes. The humour essentially lies mismatch pairing two actors funny. There crackling dialogue, splits thanks actors complimenting well. Hoitz leaves stone unturned let Gamble know much hates him, total nerd Gamble is, doesn’t mind. Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton), plays boss characters equally funny senior cop bisexual son, weekend passion running supermarket sells luxury toiletries. The film wonderful product placement Toyota Prius, car lead actors use assignments. I loved way car’s features embedded Gamble’s character mannerisms. The writing performances enough provoke laughter comic scenes well-connected ensure film series gags one other. There’s something staring Will Ferrell’s face produces tingling funny bone. He’s one better slapstick actors, one doesn’t try hard show comic timing. The film action comedy, backdrop embezzlement funds. There’s action - lots it, pretty well executed. But screenplay patchy, bit formulaic I’m sure I blame writers entirely - action comedies genre continue like this. The non-stop bullying Hoitz Gamble’s colleagues seems forced. Moreover, I couldn’t fathom Hoitz would want calculator loving Gamble join investigative pursuits. How two become partners first place? A bit history met became resigned boring desk jobs, would added colour story. The sub-plot Hoitz’s failed romance ability ballet really well, doesn’t add film’s overall proceedings way. The extras DVD bit lip-service. There deleted scenes - meaningless, them. However, behind-the-scenes footage stunts interesting, interviews director actors. The Other Guys got several flaws, addition everything comes formulaic script. But it’s funny film alright.
