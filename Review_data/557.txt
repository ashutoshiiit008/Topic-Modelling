Based novel name Anita Nair, Lessons Forgetting, directed Unni Vijayan, speaks many issues, big small, pertinent relevant, becomes important film must watched, well film doesn’t make easy watch all. The film gnaws away know think know relationships, people society, journey characters film undertake, deal loss. Set primarily Bangalore tiny coastal town Tamil Nadu, film also perceptible flavour setting, makes seem far ‘real’ films we’ve seen lately. J. A. Krishnamurthy NRI back India, daughter Smriti suffered severe, near-fatal accident. As digs cause behind accident, trying get root it, also discovers knew daughter far lesser he’d ever imagined. Meanwhile, Meera middle-aged mother two whose husband walks without slightest warnings. As deals this, Meera Krishnamurthy’s paths cross. Fashioned mystery reality human drama, commentary relationships societal stereotypes, film rendered relevant fact takes long, hard look manner Indian women seen society today, another, far gruesome worrying truth gender politics India – fact day 21st century, interiors India still opposed birth girl child. But rural India; know don’t we? All us engage social media outrage lack education amongst ‘other’ India gender equality. How urban India, then? A man walks marriage, even teenaged daughter holds mother responsible it, without second’s thought. An outspoken, friendly, educated girl wants wear tank top hot, nature she’s friendly every guy meets, automatically makes object men want ‘own’. “She’s girl,” exclaims one over-enthusiastic male friends, without ever bothering find feels way. The film offers solutions; it? I’ve gone hoarse saying cinema mirrors society, way round, matter much people blame portrayal women screen reason behind men objectifying women real life. The malaise deep-rooted society, right time girl born. Before begin eradicating problem, must recognize it. That, precisely, film offers us; holds mirror reminds us need change within. In fact, portions film make blood boil, see spineless yet savage Indian men be, comes treat woman. The film also interesting narrative technique, albeit one sometimes work it. It non-linear, space time cuts present day place Krishnamurthy lead happens Smriti, also continuously shifting points view – past carried forward bit bit people Smriti encounters along way. However, constant back-and-forth may tend make restless; present day portions often seem like speed-breakers narrative. In fact, film 96 minutes long, actually seems far longer that. The pace narrative sags often, screenplay meandering present day portions. Still, nervous anticipation looms large throughout performance lead cast, still doesn’t bore you. Adil Hussain, plays Krishnamurthy, excellent. The desperation father, yet sense calm exudes even tough situations, (contributed to, perhaps, fact Krishnamurthy spent many years US), tears fights hard keep within, everything performance almost perfect. I found English dialogue delivery tinged ever slight accent, still heartening see Indian film heavy English largely stay away terrible accents. It also good see Roshni Achreja long, extremely natural Meera. Some supporting cast seem struggle, especially younger ones. Raaghav Chanana, last seen disaster Rangrezz Jackky’s friend, good presence, though I couldn’t help wonder baritone indeed his. Maya Tideman, plays pivotal role Smriti, bit mixed bag. While manner emotes delivers dialogue often little raw, presence seems strangely justice complex character plays. Your heart reaches character gruesome things happen her, also makes connect sense idealism purity radiates. And I say purity, isn't misplaced sense 'feminine purity', good human being. Despite issues pacing questions ask screenplay, Lessons Forgetting important film brave film terms subject narrative. The way cinema going get better whole-heartedly support films like this. So whether choose watch theatre whether wait DVD released, I hope pay watch film; Lessons Forgetting deserves it.
