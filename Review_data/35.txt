Nope. There's hope anything Akshay Kumar ever unglamorous non-stylized. If Nagesh Kukunoor can't it, one can. Given 8 x 10 Tasveer thriller, maybe whole super-heroic personality accorded main lead intentional. But, borders disbelief closely film feels like comedy doesn't strike awe all. And I'm yet talking superpowers has. That Jai (Akshay Kumar) look past accepted assumption. The weird mumbo-jumbo provided explanation ignored. Once that, it's interesting concept opens world opportunities. Nagesh's use protagonist's ability gives regular "who dunnit" nice flavor. Jai realizes things bit bit audience becomes aware happened. This slow unfolding adds curiosity. And yet somehow there's connection Jai audience. There's distance stays movie doesn't let get involved. I blame over-dramatization that. Either hero villain resurrecting like The Terminator 80-90ish thus exasperating. "Die already" feel like yelling audience. This reminds "fall already" viewer actually yelled theater never-ending, pointless jump Jai makes one early sequences. Had whole theater laughing! The script good job pointing finger involved. Just like person looking answer would suspect every one around him. But problem mysteries foreshadowing attempt confuse give tiny bit away. Deleting elements scene later showing element way saying, "caught you!" It's cheating. Twists awesome I love catch unaware. But twists either come tad late pre-empt them. Or almost blue little difficult digest. Another thing annoys villain spelling everything hero thus audience. There surely must better way go this. Even discount fact action films don't necessarily need whole deal acting, performances wooden. Especially Girish Karnad - sizable amount guffawing dialogue delivery. While Akshay Kumar usual bit, Ayesha Takia tolerable. What's happening woman impressive two years ago. Javed Jafferi hand brought smile laughter every movement - time intentional. By way, I shudder think Nagesh ever full blown bedroom scene script. Just hug comes heavily awkward. Or Sharmila Tagore strutting around censor scissors set? Drop baggage associated Nagesh Kukunoor film. He seems struggling strike balance sensibilities mainstream cinema. Don't worry, stylish titles help along - really slick associate Kukunoor name. Maybe he's trying say, "I make films too!" Also, keep Akshay Kumar 'star' style tag sans loudness - thankfully! And might give good chance enjoy this.
