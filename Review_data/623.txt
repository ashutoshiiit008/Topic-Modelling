Based Marianne Pearl’s book name, A Mighty Heart focuses events surrounding immediate aftermath kidnapping Pearl’s husband, fellow-journalist Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl (played Dan Futterman). When went missing, Daniel Karachi – film set – investigate extremist links British national Richard Reid, infamous failed ‘shoe bomber’, jihadist Guantanamo detainee. The film essentially documents combined attempts Pakistani security forces, US intelligence services, Daniel’s colleagues Marianne find Daniel captors. Marianne (played Angelina Jolie) unwilling victim circumstance: proactive, passionate fiery attempts unravel tangled web contacts, fixers middlemen quest locate husband. Director Michael Winterbottom faces challenge, deals admirably: combine reconstruction dramatisation. For former, Winterbottom uses several techniques giving film ‘fly wall’ documentary quality, heavy use handheld camera shots, along datelines interspersed contemporary news footage. For latter, keeps tempo editing – quick cuts shots, jump cuts pacy visuals. The combination documentary style visuals action thriller pacing definitely vogue right – The Bourne Ultimatum stands prime example. Anurag Kashyap also crack Black Friday, A Mighty Heart succeeds Black Friday ultimately failed. Whereas many sequences Black Friday would worked dramatisations within documentary, film fell lack genuine characterisation cohesive narrative. A Mighty Heart manages pull off. This definitely Marianne’s story – Daniel’s – we’re firmly placed shoes throughout. Winterbottom resists temptation either dramatise speculate Daniel Pearl’s incarceration itself. Following Daniel’s disappearance, emphasis firmly Marianne’s desperate search, see flashbacks photographs. Just like Marianne, learn truth piece piece story unfolds. As Black Friday Steven Spielberg’s Munich, A Mighty Heart avoids over-simplistic cartoonish characterisations ‘bad guys’. This adds realism; even jihadists families too. Much said Jolie’s portrayal Marianne. Is right actress part? To fair, Jolie deserves credit performance. She puts strong emotional turn undoubtedly challenging role, certainly less irritating usual. Without influence (and husband, co-producer Brad Pitt) it’s unlikely film would made first place. Although Jolie star name, film benefits balanced understated performances across cast. In particular, ever-reliable Irrfan Khan excellent Captain, Pakistani CID officer leading investigation. Futterman relatively little screen time, convinces, Archie Panjabi Marianne’s friend hostess Asra – Indian Pakistan faces problems own. Winterbottom occasionally lapses cliché – possible signify new day Pakistan without panning across hazy dawn skyline accompanied cry muezzin? It seems not. As soon leave haven Asra’s lavish Karachi bungalow we’re pitched immediately apparent chaos downtown Karachi. Yet Karachi’s traffic might seem threatening many – presumably used device unsettle audience – would faze Daniel Pearl, experienced journalist lived worked Bombay. As adaptation non-fiction book, A Mighty Heart may luxury conventional plot. However, film demonstrates care attention detail possible produce intelligent, thought-provoking dramatisation without resorting sensationalist flourishes. Fittingly, like Marianne Daniel, A Mighty Heart dignity.
