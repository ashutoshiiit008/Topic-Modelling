Have ever passed cartoons TV translated Hindi? In dubbing characters seem done two people - one male one female. In amount nasal shrillness defines acting voice acting. The entire film dubbed like this. Don't know I'm talking about? Sample - !! WARNING !! This example dubbing. It neither supposed imply film entertaining mean kids. To fair, maybe four voices two. The dubbing film made realize important role plays experience. Not many great lines remember film by, even would difficult enjoy trying figure language actors originally speaking in. By end, I concluded lost script dubbing entirely different dialogues used instead original lines said shooting. Sure, every time dubbing off-synch it's distracting, difficult even figure whether actors emoting saying lines. Such impact film see one Dev D Gulaal, effect enjoyment Mahie Gill's brilliant performances them. If fine actor's act questionable, I really need talk acting skills questionable cricketers? Another change career way Vinod Kambli Ajay Jadeja, hopefully. Actually, Vinod Kambli's character specific function film! There off-chance film desperately trying spoof not-so-well-thought-out Hindi films. Which could explain child artist playing producer, adamant demand "item number", disgruntled writer tell story anyone willing lend ear, random fights, songs, continuity jumps, shoddy editing, etc. But I feeling brain working overtime rather scriptwriter giving script iota thought. Each scene accentuates bewilderment, "How could see stupid is!?" At various points film, body language actors wonder whether briefed emotion required all. They seem thing like 5-year old would get naughty school concert rehearsal. This highlighted songs. There seems instructions all. The choreography seems reserved action sequences see actors trying remember next step. This certainly one films can't really complain about. Because every complaint voice head either goes, "What expecting!?" or, "Why bother?"
