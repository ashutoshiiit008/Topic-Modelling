In absolute terms Jumbo, baby elephant keep kids good company. But relatively speaking doesn’t zing The Lion King wit sensitivity Finding Nemo, two movies plot seems tried combine. On look missing father, Jumbo loses way torn apart mother too. What child identify with? Separation parents - biggest fear traumatic nightmare imaginable. Going ahead too, plot treated kid gloves. It stays pretty close dark. That makes kids’ movie respects target audience’s intelligence even subtlety noticed them. And yet need fun energy, I think missing. That kids might miss all, completely different matter. The story doesn’t anything new, kids love repetition. And hey, is, fact better alternatives produced recent times. So, depends comparing too. There enough either side scale Jumbo stands pretty much middle. Same goes animation, wasn’t entirely appealing. Elephants long legs, wide eyes, proportion trunks pleasing watch, even 90 minutes. Same goes animals sketched out. I liked concept elephants multiple colors though. A comment species stays united despite variation skin color? In mind voices characters done well, I try hard recognize voice - seems familiar I cant spot modulation. So, Gulshan Grover Gulshan Grover Rajpal Yadav Asrani play themselves, I find mundane annoying. On hand despite tremendous publicity Akshay Kumar Dimple Kapadia got, sounded like supposedly-cute elephants would could speak. Their inflections sounded convincing. On Hindi animation scene kids, isn’t much happening - especially non-mythological. In sense, good Jumbo dubbed right amount star value. But otherwise, isn’t anything remarkably different story animation.
