When sitting multiplex 559 people theater whistling away glory movement star film, especially male one, know film's target audience. And restricted first minutes film, continued regular intervals end. So, Salman-followers stop reading head theater, it's waiting echo whistles. For rest us lesser-mortals, ain't much going there. Itâ€™s gang war routine. One kills kills third on. And couple turns along way. The story random, unbelievable crazy one could expect. Yet, dialogues keep going while, really funny lines there. Salman Khan style accompanied one-expression-says-it-all expression. Of course, slo-mo entries add spunk, lacking. Then there's Ayesha Takia trying cope speed film.

That one I'd give full credit extra layers makeup. Also lady can't dance. I actually felt bad her. She hardly ever dancing WITH Salman frame. The sequence cut simple steps every while.

It certain quality it, since doesn't go deep, couldn't care much either forming pair pair entity. And I guess that's intention either. Wanted merry surface, would want go deeper? There must swearing ceremony cast crew - "I swear XXX, I shall take seriously." I think similar clause applies buy ticket. Me? Well, I'm star-crazy, I wouldn't understand mania. But fun watching people enjoy.
