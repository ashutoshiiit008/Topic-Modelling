You see politician frustrated system corrupt doesn't allow justice way be. You see find solution. You see set department blatantly kill everyone know guilty, without heed legality. You see potential story handle something controversial. You hold smirk see department called...."Department"! Except see weirdest angles camera positions imaginable. You want call imaginative ambivalently end wishing one imagined all. Because histrionics camera rob anything half-decent film potentially had. It hurts discredit someone trying creative. But fact remains that, spurt ingenuity didn't work one bit. And believe me, experience taught brace myself, I would roller coaster ride, entering RGV film - even ones produced him, let alone directed man himself. I'd felt less annoyed non-standard camera work directorial purpose terms characters situations it's used for. But nothing sort happens. The coolness fact ends with, "I wonder camera striker moving carrom board tea-pan taken cup tea strained." If something symbolic I missed, want trying. Department full quirky characters performances. And characters interesting too, mainly carry shades gray despite business killing people. But none grayness taken further, tempted den left darkness regular underworld story. The boring nexus business crime called politics, crime business politics, politics business crime - that's RGV tweet making! That's dialogue film sounds like - right director's twitter timeline. Yet, moments, especially Amitabh Bachchan screen feel like respite coming way. His character's (Sarjerao) enigma charming right end. So much going about, I don't mind Department 2,even I'm bound disappointed. Sarjerao's quirkiness makes laugh loud. I actually waited bated breath felt like going advocate drinking alcohol, much 'daaru peene se liver kharaab...' vein. But alas, nothing epic sort happens, even mini epics. Instead, left wondering point scene. And many, many scenes come go disconnected film itself. The rest criss-cross crossers, double-crossers. Again regular sort, nothing haven't seen earlier gangwar film. There one issue I've always use child actors violent films. Department many violent chase sequences children shown passing. Not child bothered shooting going on, continue play ball. Even intent show desensitizing children violence, I can't help shudder every time I see actual child scene like - made act indifferent violence around him/her. Irrespective that, Department chance make us see sides solution choose degenerating systems. But, makers chose focus camera gimmickry rather build premise chose. The stuff see underworld film done death, new stuff makes wish hadn't tried things between, didn't explore fullest.
