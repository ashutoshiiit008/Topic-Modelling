Channing Tatum Rachel McAdams look pretty darn good together. He’s handsome manly, she’s petite cute. You’ve won battle casting right romantic film – aim audience feel love. It makes job easier lead actors make good looking pair. The Vow love story two fairly young individuals find bit spot. Everything seems romantically blissful newlyweds, Leo Paige. They seem merrily love, little parade glee gets cut short Paige loses memory car accident. She doesn’t remember anything happened last 5 years. On part, McAdams whole confused bit pretty convincingly. Tatum madly love wife regular flashbacks see wonderfully romantic things – want yank memory loss. But here’s movie’s biggest problem: nothing strong enough. The love becomes corny every then, emotion (be horror memory loss, frustration husband sharing apartment stranger wife on) established strong enough. Halfway portrayal, already want move onto main question film poses: regain memory? The Vow based real-life incident involving Kim Krickitt Carpenter, doesn’t really grip enough. The first minutes film looks wonderfully bohemian, see Leo Paige’s life. Her art studio abstract clay cut outs, apartment filled color coordinated furniture different shapes. But really, that’s one thing I remember warming heart, real hero film production designer Kalina Ivanov. Unlike similarly plotted film, 50 First Dates, film doesn’t comedy streak fall back on. Or goofy Adam Sandler. It could fairly gripping film, interesting plot, steered clear regular cliché: love conquers all. Treated differently, perhaps film could focused Leo strives make fall back love him. On contrary, The Vow leaves much chance lead pair realize feelings one another. Sure, it’s well-behaved clean average film. If you’re mood cheesy weekend flick, The Vow delivers promptly. It could crisp film; free melodrama dialogues given attention, good looking lead pair regular dose love, run-off-the-mill romance movie. If you’re it, gives exactly want.
