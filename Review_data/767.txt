That specter Holocaust continues prey upon psyche Europe extent America, evinced number films documentaries made unceasing regularity, nearly seventy years post World War II, comes surprise, given agony torment Holocaust generated. Some notables recent past included, Roman Polanski’s The Pianist, Roberto Benigni’s Life Beautiful, Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List. Most depicted events Jewish point view; suffering Jews struggling survival face extreme cruelty perpetrated Nazis, else people way rescued Jews “Final Solution”. The Reader deals Holocaust too, presents fundamentally love story tale lost innocence; love story two highly disparate individuals ways quite like other. The film follows non linear narrative; continuously juxtaposing present remembered past plunging back recent present. This could get confusing viewers; one follow lives primarily two main characters encounters other, little patience well rewarded. Stephen Daldry earlier gave us beautifully understated Billy Elliot charge here, makes solid job it. The film opens adult Michael Berg played Ralph Fiennes, ruminating past chance encounter Hannah (Kate Winslet). We see Fiennes nearly two thirds film, except brief moments, story younger self played David Kross. The first half film shot soft focus warm colours, highlighting first flush love young Michael also possibly discovery sexuality. This phase film comes across idyllic, slowly come understand Michael Hannah things common. The rest film deals traumatic events, events influenced nation whose presence seeps lives future generations. The film raises questions collective guilt, shame, individual choice responsibility, notion justice different law morality. These issues teased lives two protagonists, exemplify “normal” individuals, two different generations. Both protagonists made choices, continue make them, never sure motives. This ambiguity characters highlighted repeatedly, thus possibly making us aware shortcomings human; shortcomings clear answers. The strength film lies takes overarching theme Holocaust examines perspective two ordinary German citizens. The script builds layers commenting nature forgiveness reconciliation, examining role legal system, depicting tremendous repercussions “historic” events day day living. The film heart stopping moments, heart wrenching dialogues; deeply emotional done subtle restrained manner. As life, film offer us closure neat resolution, questions remain unanswered. Ralph Fiennes pleasure watch always, David Kross portrays adolescent later troubled young Michael Berg, well. Kate Winslet’s ample curves display early film, face eyes, character germinates. The Reader easy film watch especially Indian viewers; nothing comparable Holocaust embedded collective consciousness. True, Partition related cruelty inhumanity happened, seem completely buried far popular culture concerned, barring stray film there. That Partition spawned continues spawn intolerance violence really examined commented upon. That could possibly Nation, collectively reject notions History, instead comfortable embracing Mythology stead. The Reader European film, sense examines History critical lens digs deep collective well spring national consciousness. Definitely worth dekkho. PS. The film uses leit motif reading literary consciousness underscore lives two protagonists. Again European, use literature literacy perspective human thought action.
