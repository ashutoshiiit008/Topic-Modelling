There easier way say this, I’m going say it; I extremely disappointed Gangoobai. An NFDC-produced film, made script NFDC Screenwriters’ Lab selection 2009 developed thereon, I expected extremely strong least script level. There denying film heart soul. It talks hope means human being, materialistic life become today human spirit still power triumph greatest travails. However, film suffers writing described naïve. The film follows journey aging bai (maid-servant) lives sylvan Matheran, hill-station far Mumbai. In course work, chances upon something entices heart beyond limits rationality. Spurred burning desire possess it, toils hard four years managing accumulate enough money buy it. Then, sets journey Mumbai purchase said item, expecting return within day. However, journey doesn’t quite go planned. As I mentioned earlier, naivety film’s writing something I still can’t get over. The attempt evoke emotions regard Gangoobai evident often feels manipulative. The film doesn’t try tug heartstrings; tries manhandle them. Also, every single character film far-fetched; isn’t hint realism actions, words reactions Gangoobai. No matter seem exterior, manner instantly treat Gangoobai like centre world continuously rings false. Gangoobai seems one defect – obsessive behaviour regarding possessing something doesn’t really need. Apart that, perfect human - hardworking, resourceful, talented, open-minded, intelligent, charming many qualities make exceedingly loveable. Cute, really, distinctly unreal. The realism comes tiny side characters - rich Sindhi woman believes unquestionable superiority obsessive boyfriend doesn’t respect celebrity girlfriend’s work. Sadly, don’t really much contribute film way. The film also suffers technically - inconsistent lighting, poor framing choppy editing keep rearing heads film. The bland background score nothing help it. Also, I consistently bothered strange mix Marathi Hindi characters speak film. Why would two Maharashtrians switch Hindi mid-sentence? Why would non-Maharashtrian attempt speak Marathi character clearly understands Hindi? Yes, real life India multi-lingual, certain use logic determine language character speak when. Of cast, veteran actress Sarita Joshi title role justice character. She clearly worked hard character, often manages elicit smile. Purab Kohli’s turn love-struck middle-class man appeals bits, inconsistent. Mita Vashisht endearing, performance strikes many false note. Raj Zutshi fashion designer over-the-top, not? Nidhi Sunil supermodel heart gold struggles part. The film written, directed edited Priya Krishnaswamy – film quite literally baby. While I’d laud emotions form foundation film, I’d also honest say film rarely, ever, rises mediocrity department. I’d still go watch next film certainly brave director choosing make kind film has. I’d also urge financial stake cinema – producers audiences – support films like Gangoobai. But Gangoobai film really must-watch.
