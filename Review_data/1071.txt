For person watches least two films week theaters, including really bad ones, I admit difficult films get hooked. But, hand-in-hand, equally difficult keep 100% detached what's going screen. Even expectations low, I watch something like, something enjoy. But Yaariyan, manages even take away me. The screenplay place here. The clarity seems knows itself. It almost like used trial error method sticking blocks story together. That especially sad considering individual blocks story rather random first place.
