What makes Vishesh Films name films make sound like sequels? Murder 2 earlier Jannat 2 nothing films names number attached end. Is producers trying bank success earlier films get initial crowd? Is lack creativity? Is pure laziness? Or mere disinterest? The disinterest shows film actors director. Of entire team, writer seems show interest right end assignment. Sonu Dilli (Emraan Hashmi), small-time gun-dealer finds stuck cop (Randeep Hooda) forces Sonu turn informer; willingness live honest living love life (Esha Gupta); bigger-time dons underworld (Manish Choudhary). A dilemma could've much engaging awful performances tedious screenplay. Similarly, dialogues inane ones. The kind actors objection saying loud, however inept might work. No, I'm referring perfunctorily used profanity Except Emraan Hashmi, rest cast rather monotonous, one seems take one expression hold it. This fact evident cases Randeep Hooda, Esha Gupta Manish Choudhary. Anyway, usual, lead lady made irrelevant crime saga. Despite this, I'd consider climax one bravest ones recent times. It surprisingly unexpected otherwise predictable story. It also interesting one terms means various characters, even aren't written much depth. Yet, can't take away fact 'too little, little late'. Jannat 2 another one standard crime romances come Bhatt stable - less engaging average Vishesh Films' product.
