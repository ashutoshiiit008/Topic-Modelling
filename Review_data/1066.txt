They creating world imaginary, whatever want it. Yet, world create, stick laws, even they've established rules themselves. So, create mutants, deformed people, deformity makes powerful thus scary. It's break rules deviate them, distract us trying say. Whether special effects, moral dilemma, mirror hold us society. X-Men: First Class successfully avoids digressions gripping story tell. My issues X-men series mainly (even X-Men X-Men 2 The Last Stand Wolverine) - deviation. Mutant-powers redefined per convenience. Like say, mutants suddenly developing exaggerated sixth sense. The beauty concept one mutant do, cannot. It annoying then, Wolverine start hearing/smelling/sensing stuff cannot see, moves script along. The complaint I characters black white. That lame one-liners - two things made really skeptical FIFTH film series. Fortunately X-Men: First Class consumes you. There's much going terms mind games special effects already pardoned absence attempts act. That witty dialogue pauses brilliant entertainment. So yes, fear Shaw, empathize Magneto, feel Mystique wish Prof. X could give head rest finger. But that's characters they've developed last decade you. And barely anything performances. Interestingly (assuming you've seen earlier films series), know main characters film going end up. But, there's enough going make wonder wait "how". As usual, set-up display mutants capable building humungous showdown. Given cool things newly introduced mutants capable, I felt little letdown climax. As one ran $-power. Or rather money consumed thumping, loud background music. Even so, nice see Xavier, sacrosanct, use power flirt. It welcome surprise see Magneto's human side Mystique's feminine one. Their dilemmas mutant. But prejudices human. The "bad" mutants racists. The "good" mutants patronize humans evolutionary process, like real life want keep tigers going extinct. The sides choose mirror real life about. The communist/capitalist divide fight races even religions. Yep, token religious symbolism thrown too. This kind deviation unnecessary makes film going well look over-ambitious even wannabe. But, point - end 2-odd hours, I came satisfied, thriller-action-junky customer. And despite wanting little terms super-power display. X-Men: First Class one places whole adds sum parts. Warning: Some scenes obviously censored (I saw Pune, India) - either beeped words scenes cut out.
