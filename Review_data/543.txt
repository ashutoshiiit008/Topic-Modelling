Disgusting, regressive, juvenile, crass, crappy. All I expected. But Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum isn't even that. The indifference I could watch entire film pretty saddening. I didn't even feel like disliking film, like didn't even deserve kind response. Sure, lots loud cackle theater. Yet, wasn't much I thought would be. There lot slack times puerile pun, supposedly adult joke, mockery gay people. They drab spans minutes could sense boredom theater, assisted ever-so-slightly loud remark, "stop boring us." However, laughter, hard I, second, wished I could enjoy 'non-veg' jokes way people audience were. It release hearty laugh. But I could think was, really, THAT funny? But, soon overcome feeling bad lead male actors. Riteish Deshmukh Tusshar Kapoor try hard, see amount energy performance needs, yet feel sad them. They've regress mentally good 20 years. You imagine sorry I felt I saw Anupam Kher address dogs humans sulk sees mate. Yes, lot dog-mating talk film. The women, sit pretty look gorgeous well. And well, course, dance. The songs peppy energetic lyrics felt like trying hard make sense. What I found hilarious actually tried plot string together. Along mockery telemarketing, Rohit Shetty brand films, almost everything else considered intelligent, Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum ends mockery story writing itself. Like always, I find trying hard make sense films weren't intended taken seriously. But again, I part audience.
