Good news - devastating damage done (to put things perspective, guy starred Aap kaa Suroor) Bad news - We saw almost 25 years ago watch home time like! Then, pray tell us, would want see Himessss-bhai instead chintu-mama? It's going claimed target multiplex cine-goer "masses". Tell me, section enjoys Himesh fainting like every pregnant woman Hindi movies? And section going mesmerized Urmila's fairy-tale-like vampish gait? Character sketches movies like amazing. For instance, woman given important place story line...after man completely unquestioningly smitten her...and yet function less prop. She exists. It must sort-of art make object 'true love' bystander whose primary function lick ice-creams go soft toy fetish. Damn, doesn't even bother offer support man life disclosed inner turmoil he's going through! In 80's thoroughly enjoyed thrived cinematic liberties taken. But hasn't audience matured least bit since then? Even every character, sickness health, richer poorer, Karzzzz best anti-aging cosmetics disposal. You helpfully given 'then now' transitions brand ambassador Urmila Matondkar proof. None characters manage extra wrinkle, extra inch. I want whatever having! Oh, way, thinking makers ingenious enough take one movie made previously, get set proven wrong. Kabira (Danny Denzongpa) given lines old Hindi movies fit particular situation. They relevant enough so, doesn't become painful. Though every time someone said "kudrat ka karishma" (nature's freak miracle), I felt like saying, "not really, happened 25 years ago (if earlier)." And blatant references Deewar, Shaan, Mr. India. Not mention mimicry artist villain, bad man, Gulshan Grover Feroze Khan-cum-Shaakal look. Of course, borrowing neither stops dialogues old Hindi movies. The songs seen there, heard that. No-no, I'm referring "ek haseena thi" signature tune original. (Although, man actually sounds good voice-producing organs overpower mighty nose!) I'm referring first song ("ishq duniya mein") sounds like Himesh's compositions earlier movies. And second, third, numbers sound like first. So, actually borrowing latest movie! The camerawork, background score etc. try give movie slick look - action choreographer going home run Himesh flying mansion. And however smart make movie look it's reincarnation, half-hearted attempt logic/logistics climax makes laugh harder. One argument could Karz likeable what's wrong Karzzzz? Itâ€™s story all. But somehow, balance tilts Himesh Reshammiya snickered members audience every time attempts emotion.
