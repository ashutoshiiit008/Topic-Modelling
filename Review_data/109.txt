Not often women's sexuality rather openness sexuality explored Hindi films. For that, BA Pass appreciated. But that, pretty hollow affair. There lots bold, sexual sequences dealt pretty matter-of-factly. That could good thing, that's scene aimed conveying. There tinges pity hatred supposed feel, don't. The way Sarika's (Shilpa Shukla) character built up, you'd liked hate her; similarly you'd liked feel bad Mukesh (Shabad Kamal) feeling superficial. Fortunately unfortunately, nothing performances. The screenplay and/or direction culprit here. The film strong base sexually explicit scenes, feels like actors put extra effort feel comfortable sequences. Wherein lies problem. The effort shows, instead chemistry reaching you. Which still better awkward sex scenes see Hindi films otherwise. Sure, bunch characters, don't really feel anything distance acceptable. But, I connect one, either positive negative way, keeps getting involved film experience. That besides, story lot meat terms cheating wife general manipulative opportunist; shy boy used; women express sexuality. But themes explored rather half-heartedly, except sex angle, gets plenty exposure. It's like I'm asking possibilities get attention - like dynamics marital strain sibling angle. You shown tiny sparks nothing dwelt long. Just would worked better themes picked fleshed better. Later, BA Pass becomes hotch-potch moments despair. They forced, pre-decided make dark film. You weird mix stylized treatment comes late quite place. Halfway film, I wondered experience would've different I seen film serious film festival audience instead seated easily excitable bunch boys. But, film progressed, I relieved feel assured wouldn't make much difference. As disconnected may sound, film's title impressed most. Ironical root, BA Pass title fits film perfectly one ways. Unfortunately, that's impact film stops - skin deep.
