Love transcends generations. True love transcends logic. Romantic relationships hundred years ago live viciously circular life ages come. Most us know first-hand, yet parts lives don’t mind watching Priyanka Chopra Shahid Kapoor enact. But, three times two times much. Teri Meri Kahaani takes concept little seriously offers variety sameness love century. One things Teri Meri Kahaani tries convey love first sight; connections seem magical; vibes run strong ignore – could imply deeper bond. A bond crosses life-times. A beautiful thought that. But writer, Kunal Kohli doesn’t anything exceptional lovely theme. Teri Meri Kahaani ends ol’ love story repeated span two hours. One would think way three stories tie would mean something just, ‘it’s meant be’. Unfortunately, climax builds nicely damp squib. Yet, film holds performances, sparkling dialogue inherent sweetness romantic relationships start. We see Shahid Kapoor Priyanka Chopra disarm charm thrice doesn’t get tiring performances. Many moments lots chemistry keep engaged actors, even story characters aren’t interesting. This despite fact three characters one play almost same, except Ruksar meek yet popular film star. Both Radha Aradhana strong personalities know want life. On hand, Govind, Krissh Javed arrogant smart-Alecks. It’s amazing Priyanka Chopra Shahid Kapoor manage emote wide variety bring flavor three almost similar characters. I especially enjoyed Shahid Kapoor Javed. Prachi Desai short presence leaves feeling her, way portrays way character faces truth. Neha Sharma annoys well ‘typical girlfriend’ character. The rest supporting cast nothing makes notice them, I don’t get awful actors chosen play British officers. The period setting 1950s cute – doesn’t look authentic all, textile industry times Phoneix Mills actually mill give flavor era. So Shahid Kapoor’s tribute Charlie Chaplin Kunal Kohli’s tribute silent era. On hand culture depicted times terms say girl would behave small village 1910s dress Bombay chawl 1950s difficult digest. And lovely poetry aside, nothing sacred freedom struggle – energetic, completely romantic song middle jail!? Really? There difficulty hand accepting role technology plays romance 2010s. Neither difficult accept nastiness woman scorned. Bits engage you; parts make smile, laugh LOL; many chunks make wonder film couldn’t least little different three love stories hurriedly put together.
