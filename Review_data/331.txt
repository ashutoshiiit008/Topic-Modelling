Boasting large ensemble cast characters absolutely necessary, debutante director Lijin Jose’s Friday often meandering still engaging effort, one must lauded sheer audacity terms number stories woven together. Set time span day, Friday precise, film jumps various characters, ordinary people like me, many come various reasons via ferry town Alappuzha, better known non-Keralites Alleppey. The characters range irritable autorickshaw driver, family headed father whose youngest daughter married week, childless couple intend adopt young girl, couple hoodlums trying sell sort exotic animal sly, pregnant beggar woman another child hand, many, many stories characters. In fact, even I listed ones I did, I thought many I haven’t. There many characters stories Friday three quarters hour spent establishing them. That perhaps one big flaw film – could easily done without many characters stories, still engaging. Nevertheless, story reaches little turning point, film picks steam. The film proceeds breakneck speed every story hurtles towards little ending, even number hitherto unrelated characters come together larger, conventional climax. One problems many stories running parallel fact many false climaxes resolutions. I could sense fidgety members audience desperately wondering exactly going on. The narrative means complex, demands total attention order truly make sense going on. The experience immersing lives many characters made even convincing actors playing characters. Fahad Fazil excellent autorickshaw driver need money, faced moral dilemma. Thespian Nedumudi Venu pitch perfect hassled father bride-to-be, Vijayraghavan playing kindly police office helping excellent well. Many performances, many list out, fairly convincing. What really works film stories depicts life real person, carving little slice audience savour. The parallel narrative, something I always enjoy, adds overall experience. The last moments film daring, something filmmakers would attempted. While standout technical achievements film, cinematography background score purely functional, credit must given editor handling many stories weaving together without ever making audience wait long next snippet story. Going back background score, I often felt choice background pieces certain scenes poor, detracting intended impact scene rather adding it. In spite hiccups, Friday still film worth watch. It heartening see young filmmaker vision attempt something means easy manage justice most. Lijin Jose director watch Friday film I’d recommend anyone likes completely engaged involved film.
