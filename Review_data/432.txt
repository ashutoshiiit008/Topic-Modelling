I hate sinking feelings. And I hate even come happy spell. Exactly I hate LUV stories me. The difference reason happy spell untimely death. If haven't gotten yet, one regular love story, despite dressing up. The cute quips charming one-liners make smile first half, save maybe first 5-10 minutes lead pair's voiceover reading story. You actually start caressing hope film might actually 'different'. Only wishful thought muscled pulp ultra s…l…o…w motion second hour begins. The silver lining film doesn't entirely lose sense humor even going gets bad. Post-interval too, everyday humor stays that's truly relief ping-pong ball treatment accorded audience. Also fortunately, Imran Khan music/lyrics/picturisation songs keeps entertained trauma. Imran certainly added well range expressions. Only perfect face chocolate hero thus non-believer love doesn't quite suit rather failed get across. Sonam Kapoor plain, stiff, flat I'd like say expressionless I can't one expression maintains. I'd loved brand love stories hateful, we've seen decent ones. And I'm talking traditional MPKs, QSQTs, DDLJs. The urban takes subject - Love Aaj Kal, Wake Up Sid, Luck By Chance, Bachna Ae Haseeno, Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na - bad. But remaking one film guise spoof, doesn't really make new story. Note 2 5 mentioned LOVE GURUS Yash Raj Films Dharma Productions 2 others spoofs. Statistics, oh well. I churn many numbers avail. A good film one doesn't rid happy feeling least wins make-audience-happy vs. screw-audiences-gray-cells battle. Let's say wait good film become bearable thanks I Hate LUV storys. I hope lull Hindi filmmakers hit us huge storm. Waiting. . .
