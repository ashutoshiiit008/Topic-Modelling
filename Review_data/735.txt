To say Pyaar Ka Punchnama relies heavily stereotyping women would stating obvious understated manner. But here; watching film, might well give in. And see land puppies bitches. Women unreasonable, flaky, demanding, ruthlessly selfish kind human beings. As corollary, kind humans puppy-in-distress way eyes heart. If manage get past obvious, annoying assumptions, situations; lines make smile remind someone know. It actually possible enjoy film assume writer/director, Luv Ranjan stupid enough actually believe women fall intolerable, slappable category men aawwww-so-cute-and-helpless. You give Luv benefit doubt believe happened pick characters. It's like don't exist real life. After giving writer/director much, I enjoyed characters. Only men course. Even I blamed letting women get unredeemable situations, women - times, I wanted slap. In sense direction, lines performances succeeded. The reason I won't rip apart movie performances could gone wrong them. Each six main characters great job character. They actually behave like normal people. In fact, surprised me. I'd last person laugh even smile monologue guy (Kartikeya Tiwari) frustrations girlfriend. Especially it's long, oh-so long. But grew longer, started making laugh. Despite repetition. I actually felt bad poor chap claustrophobic situation. If broad plots little meat. They picked three similar starts, chose three different situations three similarly "bleh" ways end it. And yet it's one half-decent chick-flicks. I see couples getting argument watching it. And movie gets people discuss movie succeeded, even crooked way. This one made wonder too. NO! men women life. About movies dependence contrasts. A couple weeks ago saw Luv ka end, guy despicable film made woman hate women film represents. What's stark extremes? Is "balance" boring?
