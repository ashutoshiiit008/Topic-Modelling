It Tigmanshu Dhulia masala film. So, Tigmanshu Dhulia Tigmanshu Dhulia films. And masala masala films. Which means don't get anything new hotchpotch combination. You earthy, stylish element film tries keep film outside urban, polished looks associated Saif Ali Khan (yes, yes except Omkara, course). And style starts bang, opening credits itself. Some slickly done work keeping rugged too. The film itself, begins well opening too. Except abrupt badly edited opening sequence, film sets nice tone friendship Raja (Saif Ali Khan) Rudra (Jimmy Sheirgill). The camaraderie cute yet, rugged kind strength it. But, unfortunately, writing doesn't hold movie progresses. It one big enemy other, gun fights fights, till immune all. There breaks form one-liners - witty, much - delivered become iconic dialogue decade. Yes, translate either whistles eye-rolls, depending "filmy" appetite. The breaks come form songs wish didn't exist, let alone show randomly film plain awful. Mahie Gill "Don't touch body..." made uncomfortable; didn't help I sitting two men strangers. It much costume, moves, lyrics, men letching screen setting - number like set wedding entertainment groom friends family; open; broad daylight! It felt wrong. Once past though, isn't much offensive terms vulgarity. There religious remarks social ones too. The social comments take guise patriotism Robin-Hood-ism, come across sides. They show rather abruptly. The editing rather abrupt especially action sequences. Many, fact come across rather amateur execution. It shame since action choreography pretty cool, even spots. The thing going film performances rather screen presence main players. Except Raja Rudra, none characters writing going them. The two lead actors then, Sonakshi Sinha Vidyut Jamwal come late film and/or little really deserve fair comment performances. Saif Ali Khan Jimmy Sheirgill hand make rustic roles given pleasure see setting. Though, thinking simple, men want earn honest living first action sequence hard digest. But, anyway, irrelevant happens rest film. Ultimately, though, many revenge films one watch offer variety all. A couple smart lines don't cut deal. Especially almost everything else sub-par.
