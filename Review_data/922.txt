sattaakkk A slap audience's face - The Dirty Picture. The lewd men watch film experience Silk's (Vidya Balan) performance one's sitting audience right - me. Of course, literally me, I'm neither man lesbian. And sure, men enjoy bold woman. But enough us audience Silk Smitha starred 400+ films! And that's one sex symbol 80s. There others like Nylon Nandini Polyster Padmini whose lives collectively forms The Dirty Picture's Silk. Even names make us smirk, second later, snicker personalities stand for. Yet sizable number amongst us watch films. The Dirty Picture woman flaunts has, knows value encashes unapologetically. She accepted herself. How many women know absolutely comfortable are? And I haven't even asked comfortable sexuality. In fact, relaxed Silk makes us uncomfortable. The Dirty Picture uncomfortable watch. How someone positive something dark-gray society, it's almost black? And making society, us, dance. Add discomfort, torture watch flab female lead's stomach tiers, 21st century. Hell, even uncomfortable bodies. But, Silk uninhibited director, Milan Luthria. It's huge risk make female lead look ugly fat. And say, "You want gratuitous skin-show? Here, take it. And here's more." You literally force-fed cleavage point guy (yes, guy!) sitting behind said "It's getting boring now" half-naked woman screen. Yeah, second half slips. The first half breezy completely entertaining. The second half gets caught showing pathos comes stardom. It leave "She came. She got excited. She left." But lull second half might intentional. Because said pathos however mundane predictable, needed shown. Maybe line interval warning. It's clever line. And almost every line film. The dialogue "The Dirty Picture" feels like twitter timeline composed extremely witty people. Over-written, maybe, I thoroughly enjoyed humor, I laughed loud, instances theater laughed pause took line register. The wit alone entertainment enough. I'm huge fan self-referential jokes films get repetitive. But, The Dirty Picture one felt like director left extra second two, like stand-up comedian, audience "get" it. And works. It's huge compliment Milan Luthria's confidence actor's performance, meant made us forget is. Similarly, awe actor Naseeruddin Shah vanishes want slap arrogance sleaze. Tusshar Kapoor plays forgettable character, I mean compliment. Because, character meant unimportant plays well. Vidya Balan...almost whole review rave her. She made feel character I otherwise would dismissed characterless.You could see men would fall Silk, physical boldness. Like films glamorize underworld dons, glamorized "sex icons" yesteryears don't feel squirmy. Instead, empathize even convince victims. Even though every decision make towards dark-gray zone society conscious one. Sure, writing must merits actors achieve did. But, throughout film, feel getting snippets someone's life, like newspaper cuttings. The flow missing see glimpses layers make Silk intriguing person. It also felt like done knowingly, add enigma is. But, left wanting peel mask see person behind. A feeling told incomplete story. On hand, I'm glad didn't serve sappy backstory. Usually, something lacking story would make recommend film little less. But bits writing make The Dirty Picture. Especially, climax, way it's played out, reason behind things end way do. It's subtle flows swiftly. But it's beautiful one things work second half. Again, shortcomings still take away bravado takes show plump woman 150 minutes; pluck takes make cleavage undesirable (okay, maybe I'm taking far, makes cleavage look like breasts - regular part anatomy); nerve takes tell story woman people look upon. Surely, Silk Smithas world smiling graves.
