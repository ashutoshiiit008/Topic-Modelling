Friendship. It's made look fickle Gunday feel nothing characters relationships. And love course, superficial. In case, love drama, friendship melodrama, abuses directed towards "system" later, Gunday spread thin already flimsy plot line. Gunday one films make wonder made all. The action plain pretty much boring. The performances overtly stylish overbearing. The dialogue delivery one focussed making impact without support dialogue itself. The writing predictable even haven't seen trailer tell what's going happen next. If you've seen trailer, that's pretty much need know. It shudder-worthy shame story friendship nods hat Sholay. Given aspects, could keep blaming cast. Ranveer Singh Arjun Kapoor flare nostrils appropriately seem worked extra hard moving lips indicate impact energy. There one scene Ranveer Singh Priyanka Chopra gives room let go forced style actually emote. As one would expect, little late. DO NOT get started Irrfan Khan wasted here. A little late also comes courtesy mumbo-jumbo protagonists "system". That tough one sell, given attitude shown 12-13 year olds. The silver lining first half reasonably well-paced. There also flicker comment best friends take granted, movie progressed, felt like I saw it. But, Gunday mediocre gets. But again, expect film characters grow children adults camera running feet break song introducing themselves. Or film many themes doesn't take single one seriously - love, friendship, angst system.
