I’m fan subtlety. I like gestures say lot without word exchanged. Where you-say-it-best-when-you-say-nothing-at-all. I love sound silence brings it. Which why, I think I liked Majid Majidi’s Baran. The film romance accomplishment exercising restraint, bond two young characters question, never explicitly declared. You never know love, infatuation, sympathy, longing, curiosity engage country men women never ‘friends’. Where, two characters Facebook accounts, relationship statuses would read: “It’s complicated beyond understanding Zuckerberg’s algorithm.” And complications simple understand. At construction site Tehran, 17-year, chiselled face Lateef hot-tempered tea prepares workers. He picks fight drop hat, life takes turn unimaginable ways Afghan co-worker gets injured sends young son Rahmat, replacement. This Majidi gold, honest, part envious roster churned career - Children Heaven, Pedar, Colours Paradise, The Song Sparrows. Unlike films, Baran doesn’t exactly tug heartstrings make cry. Instead, leaves pondering lengths man’s behaviour influenced presence woman. Especially woman feels attraction for.

With puffy, emotive eyes, Rahmat big surprise film offers Majidi’s unveiling surprise one beautifully filmed scenes film. Beauty, fact, something Majidi consistent with. For example, fascination pigeons illustrate frame. He also continues obsession water, discover end film. In way, water therapeutic work. What cannot judged man, judged calm fluidity water. Despite slow film - last 30 minutes bit struggle - well capture every man’s reality: takes woman make us good human beings. A mother birth, wife adulthood. Lateef doesn’t - possibly explains meandering ways - faced woman life, come around changing himself. The closing shot film figures top 10 closing shots films. Incidentally, Majidi’s films also figure list. He’s clearly master finisher. He keeps things abstract, way go home feeling comfortable verdict. Baran romance like none other. The lovers never even come close touching other, brushing fingers, matter. But restraint, lies magic all. They don’t call ‘Majidi magic’ reason.
