Training Day Shooter director Antoine Fuqua’s latest film Olympus Has Fallen kind generic Hollywood action film world seeing ages now, slight change setting; time action occurs inside guarded fortified building world – The White House. Never easing corn been-there-seen-that, film mercifully whizzes fast enough make breezy watch, albeit one always patronizing towards it. Mike Banning, erstwhile head US President Benjamin Asher’s security detail reassigned duties tragedy occurred watch, rudely jolted back thick action terrorist group takes occupies White House 9/11-meets-26/11-style brute force attack, holding nation ransom. With clock ticking, Banning hope US government preventing full-scale catastrophe, tensions rising two East Asian nuclear powers, conflict root behind terror attack first place. The time film really thinking bit early on, initial attack White House; I couldn’t help feel matter outlandish events unfolding film looked, White House buildings across world would probably quite vulnerable well-planned attack. That moment serious thought didn’t last long however, as, blatantly obvious attempt symbolism, pyramidal top Washington Monument, tallest structure Washington DC, comes crashing minutes White House taken someone exclaims Hollywood-ese, “Olympus Has Fallen!” (Olympus, course, mythical home Greek Gods, really code name used White House, US Government clearly makes bones think themselves.) From on, relentless pace truly cheeky lines dialogue, play along silliness self-righteous Americanism film indulges in, even though doubt film pan out. Mike Banning, course, everyday John McClane-type action hero – enterprising, badass always step ahead evil mastermind, even pretends always playing catch-up. He even channels Bond Rambo often systematically attempting win back White House. With veteran actors playing bit roles various US Government officials – Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster Angela Bassett make appearances – collective seriousness everyone takes roles make grin. Aaron Eckhart President makes dashing charming First Man, doubt, I wonder thought casting someone looks younger Teddy Roosevelt JFK ever office, US President. It adds another layer already existing farfetchedness film. The film, course, belongs Gerard Butler, plays Mike Banning. Armed usual charm embellished accent, Butler makes best use lines action gets fun with, making sure things remain almost always watchable. Rick Yune renegade mastermind behind attacks doesn’t make convincing-enough villain, me. The film given grim feel never stands visually, maintaining all-too-familiar look throughout. Strangely enough, VFX film quite bad; something don’t expect film like this. The action set pieces executed reasonably, nothing film seems like haven’t seen before, I’ve repeated often, one big problems film. As brisk-walks climax (that can’t shake Mr. India déjà vu), Olympus Has Fallen kind no-brainer film measure fun lasts, without ever truly impressing you. So if, like me, get feeling you’re watching King Leonidas attempt save Harvey Dent Zao, sidekick henchman Die Another Day, must meet high-five.
