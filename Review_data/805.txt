What could possibly go wrong diving caves? You watch Sanctum know. I mood survivor movies, 127 Hours last week. Though Sanctum survival, comes drama-heroic-adventure movie. And says movies genre say - "never ever give up". The film simply superb 3D effects. I never impressed 3D before, even Avatar Tron Legacy. After brilliant scene ice cream Chhota Chetan nostalgia, 3D movie I felt like extending hand shove bottle way, times felt like I standing beside crew time. I wanted reach help. The narrow restrictions almost make claustrophobic, yet vastness caves demands exhilaration. And unlike movies, one 3D time – like, even rain 3D. With breathtaking underwater scenes diffused light, sheer beauty. Unfortunately, say screenplay - old, old. Actually, I make sound interesting watch it. That least make ineptitude story look less prominent concentrate magnificence caves. But since "Without Giving Movie Away", I’ll refrain :). Yet I need say - always add melodrama “inspired true story” films? Bah, puts every time. But hand, I feel thankful isn’t made look like video podcast Discovery Channel, even I love those. In spite predictable plot, still leaves wondering man versus wild. Maybe it’s completely convincing. Yet it’s evil reminder. It says human instincts, lead make choices wouldn’t otherwise made. And things, to. But course, shown much dramatically. In spite terrible dialogues mediocre acting, I’ll say go watch Sanctum visuals. Thanks cinematography, I totally understand divers would want take terrible risks - explore place “where shine light human’s been”. Please note – I watched IMAX 3D think awesome scenes I wrote probably won’t feel regular 3D.
