It since I watched film I hoped would never end. Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty, me, precisely that. A gripping cinematic adaptation long-drawn hunt Osama Bin Laden wake 9/11, I amazed every second film held sense drama, even though treatment film far dramatic. Like films based real events, particularly fresh memory, Zero Dark Thirty kind film almost anyone paraphrase sentences, knowing pretty much story proceeds, definitely knowing ends, even haven’t watched film. Yet, film much story Bin Laden found. For me, Zero Dark Thirty partly dramatization real life manhunt, partly spy-thriller mostly intensely personal (and fictional) story one persevering woman makes life’s mission find kill man spearheaded death 3000 countrymen. The film follows Maya, CIA agent recruited straight college eventually stationed Islamabad; done nothing CIA look Osama Bin Laden. From awkward, mute spectator torture captured terrorists orchestrated colleague ruthless executor torture techniques (though never losing conscience discomfort them), Maya obstinately tries every trick book, outside it, attempt smoke America’s wanted terrorist. Embellished Alexandre Desplat’s minimalist haunting background score, film technically top-notch. So much you’ll forgive goofs; example, glimpse India Post signboard scene supposedly set Pakistan (parts film shot Chandigarh). The camera captures action Zero Dark Thirty almost like another character film. It always move, nervous fidgety characters themselves, almost frustrated slow progress tracking Bin Laden’s whereabouts head honchos CIA. And camera character, soul character undoubtedly editing film. Splicing together chapters ‘the world’s largest manhunt’ across decade, across countries, hierarchies departments never losing personal touch - fact humans hunting humans - film creatively technically edited near-perfection. The final 20 minutes film icing cake. Post US release, film underwent share controversy. There doubt film’s much-talked torture scenes gruesome (but never disgusting unwatchable). But say film either glorifies torture distorts truth behind extent torture unfathomably ignorant. Maya’s reactions torture scenes manner reacts even conducts torture herself, quite amply illustrate stand Bigelow screenwriter Mark Boal taken, even though approach film remarkably close neutral. For second time week, I watched Jessica Chastain anchor film achieving remarkable graph character makes viewer feel personal stake character’s story. That said, performance Zero Dark Thirty miles ahead performance Mama. It hard imagine anyone else recreate character frail, petite woman nerves make men nervous; various male characters film never trouble believing it. Joel Edgerton wasn’t required role plays, leader SEAL team Operation Neptune Spear. Having said that, calming, reassuring effect sheer presence hard deny. A number supporting characters leave mark; Jason Clarke man initiates Maya interrogation process excellent, Kyle Chandler, plays Islamabad station chief Maya’s boss. The film never infused additional drama; actual unfolding events itself. As I mentioned earlier, riveting narrative I never wanted film end. At nearly two three quarters hour, I didn’t find film long all, though I suspect will. Still, whether interested procedural aspect hunt Bin Laden dramatized portrayal it, Zero Dark Thirty film must watched.
