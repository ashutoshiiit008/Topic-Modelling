Positioned prequel Underworld movies, Underworld – Rise Lycans tedious viewing. This movie origins conflict Vampires Werewolves (Lycans) nothing new offer terms visuals, storyline, special effects. The first film Underworld appeared nearly five years ago, watching Kate Beckinsale smoking hot leather, beat stuffing whomever. This film unfortunately holds attractions. The actors old faithfuls appeared previous two Underworld movies, continue reprise roles. Bill Nighy Vampire patriarch, fancy brocaded jackets, blue irises, powdered pale face. He believes dialogues earth shaking (or director’s instructions?), makes sure spits words effect tries vibrate jowls simultaneously. Rhona Mitra comely enough Sonja Michael Sheen sufficiently gaunt expresses tender emotions eyes (the viewer alerted fact another character, case missed completely). Kate Beckinsale appears two seconds end film since film prequel story yet. The rest cast nothing much film: look uninterested; shots prisons extras (who play prisoners) look completely confused befuddled. (or touch realism film demanded?) The film age old themes forbidden love, fight underdog injustice (literally case, since dogs descended wolves!), climactic big fight. The film visually grey black swordplay, acrobatic fights rain, lots carnage necks limbs sawed monotonous regularity, tomato juice blood, hirsute werewolves aplenty. But done thousand times one wants whole thing get fast. Unfortunately screen play help; makes sure things stretched till limit predictability called justice done ingredients pot. The film feels like director given job do, job routine pouring milk bowl cereal gone ahead done it, without bothering think much it. The production values decent, castle, towers, cliffs look real enough, special effects times respect creatures, look bedraggled. And ironic, considering prequel directed gentleman specializes creature effects! This vapid film; one standardized products studios good fabricating, audience consisting die hard fans. The film able beget single lump throat, nary tear eyes viewer. One sinks deeper seat wonders one landed watching it. Best avoided, unless one wants pay yawns.
