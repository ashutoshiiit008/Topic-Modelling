Either someone really close victim patriarchal monarchy. That makes first half Patiala House easy identify with. But vain second half diametrically opposite. Patiala House goes filmy us, it’s surprise given director's earlier ventures Akshay Kumar film set Punjab UK. Now there's stereotype justifies one. And frustrating viewer. A well-established, decently-performed, smartly-edited, first hour sinks mediocrity characters talking trying make average lives. Here start - - brilliantly balanced view racism, changing times, generation gaps, deep-rooted Indian culture, misgivings; - pointer family a-la-Nirmala-from-Khoobsurat type strong respected personality keeps family going yet villain; - arguments characters made way are; - comment human nature us ready scapegoat blame failures on; - woman's need savior invariably falls love guy thinks needs How why, why, change ridiculously quick, rather, convenient character transitions, lame situations, clichéd resolutions, oh-not-so-fun walk towards climax?? It barely looks like person wrote remaining hour half. The standards set industry make us expect loud film whenever Punjabi characters, name like Patiala House, room doubt. But silent first minutes come lovely surprise. The grainy flashback interspersed Parghat Singh Kahlon/Gattu's (Akshay Kumar) current life gives hope good couple hours ahead. This anticipation met screenplay sets good understanding Parghat father, Bauji (Rishi Kapoor). Alongside, also reinforces equation bauji family larger community. It introduces makes comprehend thought process. He one stood racists. He one brought dignity back community wronged. Of course, people respected done. Of course, fed ego proud peopled followed like law. And course, unrest. All without dialogue effect, performances. And yes, I actually begun enjoying Akshay Kumar film. I declare cricket mantra! Patiala Househas done Akshay Kumar Chak De! Shah Rukh Khan dare I say Lagaan Aamir Khan - bring one best, THE best, performances thus far. It pure joy see loud actor like Akshay Kumar play meek guy yet make character look like buffoon. Equal credit writing direction. How I wish didn't break bubble slipping Akki-mode every while, especially romantic moments. Fortunately, weren't many those. His love interest, Simran (Anushka Sharma) focus story. Her strong character knew step sidelines also made look inconsistent. But again, focus story Bauji Simran, cares, right? Yet, Anushka certainly best help Simran bring smile audience. The lady screen presence rare even part owed overacting - bright refreshing. It might stay fresh long continues play type role again, though. Another woman effective presence Dimple Kapadia. With barely couple lines her, registers silent protests. The rest cast apt bitchy, resigned, cool, caricatured, confrontational, on. A reasonable variety characters display pack cards fall. I guess I'll thank many things could done go overboard last minutes. Oh well. Anyway, Valentine's Day coming up, you'd expect romantic movie Friday. But, I guess, popular holiday replace cricket world cup begins next week. Unfortunately, Patiala House lame opening ceremony, especially god-awful camerawork captures cricketing moments. Anyway, half-good ceremony half-good (pliss appreciate attempt inane commentary!)
