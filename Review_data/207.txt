We know Aslan, White Witch Pevensie kids pretty well last two Narnia films. This movie brings two younger kids, Edmund Lucy, intolerable cousin Eustace Narnia help Prince Caspian find seven lords Narnia ship, Dawn Treader. A fluent flow story regular doses excitement keeps rooted seats run-time. Unlike previous episodes, rushed cover plot points story, movie brings depth characters film. The music intensifies terror matches unhurried plot development. A good thing don’t need read novels understand movie. Of course people who’ve read series argue differently couple changed sequences, true every classic fantasy novel adapted movie. I could see kids theatre tremendously enjoy themselves, adults seemed genuinely like world magic wonderment. The dialogues awesome, I bet right book. The actors playing Pevensie kids haven’t improved much previous films. But casting Will Poulter role Eustace Srubb one better decisions. He brilliant job whiny, unbelieving obnoxious cousin. His encounters Reepcheep, talking mouse, give many laugh excellent timing dialogues. Ben Barnes plays good Caspian portraying buried doubts ability. The action sequences really good, especially considering target audience school kids. Though emotional scenes bit lengthy boring, I sure kids love them. The special effects superb too. The talking mouse Reepcheep, invisible castle Monocolis (one legged dwarfs) awesomely made. Things like showing fog issuing invisible magical mirrors' mouths great ideas make film believable yet magical. That Aslan looks old less majestic, major disappointment I love character most. Thankfully, reverberating voice captivating ever before. And tried best make scariest serpent beautiful dragon. Though climax feels like mix Pirates Caribbean Harry Potter, charm. 3D sure helps, though could made much scarier appealing. With little maturity story previous films shows, direction takes cake film. Like book adopted film, one loopholes too. So read novels, surely going like way twist story convenience. But visual treat compensates it. In case, film good watch kids well adults, - 3D 2D.
