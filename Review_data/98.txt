It’s bit overwhelming write review film won 3 Academy awards barely 4 hours ago. Every person around throwing opinions The Artist – "Did deserve 3 awards?" "How it’s preposterous so-and-so watch film weekend." "How it’s actually overrated rom-com" likes. While Academy awards usually bring healthy debates post early morning broadcast, year The Artist favored most. Allow reason why. The Artist set mid-1920s. The plot seems adapted films like Sunset Boulevard Singin’ Rain (which talks rise fall silent superstar introduction talkies), The Artist stands lead pair’s ability convince you’re actually back day. Not give feeling watching homage film primarily that, The Artist holds complete attention first 5 minutes. Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin, famous silent star charming smile. It’s one pre-requisites lead actors walked around with: charming smile, thin mustache, tap-dancing ability you’re good go. In Valentin’s case, also pet dog, Uggy, remains faithful till last breath film (admittedly also favorite character film, reminds much Odie Garfield series). Anyhow, Valentin bumps Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) movie moment. What follows reminds severely scene The Social Network The Social Network, Eduardo mentions Sean Parker made biggest contribution Facebook excluding ‘The’. Valentin star wisdom adds mole Miller’s lip pencil. It’s mole takes places, turns superstar talkies started trend. We see fall Valentin, charming smile stands nothing compared epidemic hearing one’s favorite superstar speak. Every dramatic emotion played beautifully orchestrated background music – Valentin’s silent fears manifested dreams, tragic loss fame compared Miller’s instant shot success. And yet, every time appear screen wonder troubles come end, life dances. Berenice Bejo downright lovable; see audiences adore her. She appeals also she’s typical poofed-blonde-hair, curvaceous, uptight heroine (although rarity now). Peppy Miller, hand gives every woman aspires Hollywood star permission dream. The real winners The Artist, Dujardin Bejo characters George Valentin Peppy Miller, together make fall love movies. They make forget you’re told story new, make concentrate medium chosen tell it. Together make believe matter mode The Artist, cannot made without charming lead pair. Where The Artist holds disadvantage addressing audience used verbosity. It tend drag bit, parts managed overcome awe experiencing silent film. That even similarly plotted films, medium contemporary silent era referred discussed. Whereas, The Artist uses medium tell story – 4:3 aspect ratio reminds us noisy projectors movies screened, glow lighting created unreal halo around superstar film heavily orchestrated music serves cue emote. For sheer courage innovation then, willingly keep debates speculation hold, MUST watch The Artist big screen – anything else would crime. But importantly The Artist makes fall love movies again.
