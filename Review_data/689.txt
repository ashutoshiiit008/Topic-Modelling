An eclectic bunch quirky characters living chawl Pune form crux One Room Kitchen, charming little film made smile once. After disaster called Pratibimb last week, I considerably lowered expectations I went watch One Room Kitchen. Fortunately, film exceed expectations long way, also raised expectations next Marathi film I watch. The story, setting, technique, everything simple be. However, characters work, dialogue, relationships sheer fact even nicest rough edges make seem real. The story primarily revolves around young couple, Ravi Suman. Happy world chawl, life takes turn Suman meets old friend Neha, happens see apartment. Thus begins struggle obtain apartment own. The chawl contains host highly endearing characters, one interesting other. So smart, enterprising youth works garage, henpecked, out-of-work man terrifying wife dubious bottle cough syrup, gossip-loving old couple abandoned son. And some. The simple script embellished earnest performances truly warm way heart. Bharat Jadhav Ravi Bhargavi Chirmule Suman carry film part, well. Kishori Godbole Neha extremely charming, character truly lights heart. Amongst character actors, Vijay Chavan, Viju Khote Ashalata stand dialogues comic timing. Rajesh Shringarpure, playing Neha’s rich, businessman husband struggles, cast around often makes it. Rakesh Bedi, playing sleazy Gujarati broker hams, good effect. Veteran actor Dr. Shriram Lagoo makes extremely brief appearance, mere presence certain, inexplicable power it. One surprising cameo film Helen. I wish meatier role, one proper graph it. The film share flaws. Everything gets wrapped conveniently end. The climax could made impactful, instead making fit like kindergarten jigsaw puzzle. Also, manner Tilekar attempted juxtapose life chawl life apartment really insufficient even reeks bias. Each style living pros cons, director’s tilt towards one side film hard miss. So much appears perhaps Tilekar doesn’t feel way real life, forced film make work. Technically, film leaves lot desired. Simple things like avoiding UV haze forms around characters ensuring sharp focus shots would gone long way ensuring technical inadequacies don’t hamper storytelling. However, spite many flaws, One Room Kitchen works honesty. What I enjoy Marathi cinema often captures essence Maharashtrian lifestyle. This film that. So, even though film exactly must-watch, I would still recommend people, support rise Marathi cinema, savour simple joys life along way.
