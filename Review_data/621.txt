With impeccable timing, ‘Michael Clayton’ arrived time Academy Awards. It nominated seven Oscars, fair, it’s hard see why. Director (and writer) Tony Gilroy keeps action low tension high well-paced legal thriller. Gilroy’s previous writing credits include ‘Bourne’ series ‘Devil’s Advocate’, ‘Michael Clayton’ gets assume director’s chair shape movie liking. George Clooney gives strong performance title role, playing corporate lawyer increasingly torn loyalty friend colleague (Arthur Eden, played Tom Wilkinson) employers. Things complicated Clayton’s fractured personal life – seemingly de rigueur male Hollywood protagonists days. Although didn’t win time around, Clooney keeps putting performances (and stays clear ‘Oceans’ movies) he’s likely land Oscar sooner later, although role Michael Clayton isn’t meaty say, Bob Barnes 2005’s ‘Syriana’, there’s still plenty work with. The film set mainly New York City, although get see completely different side city see American Gangster, example. Here, villains – part – tucked away skyscraper offices, part sinister system lucidly described Wilkinson’s Arthur film’s fabulous opening monologue. Perhaps best word describe movie ‘understated’. There actors chewing scenery here. Instead, solid performances throughout cast. Particular credit goes Tom Wilkinson Arthur excellent Sydney Pollack Clayton’s sympathetic boss. Tilda Swinton fine job portraying senior lawyer Karen Crowder, struggling maintain cool façade despite pressures upon her. With George Clooney ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ pal Steven Soderbergh credited Executive Producers, perhaps it’s surprise ‘Michael Clayton’ looks slick. Expensive yes, flashy – keeping tone movie. Similarly, subtle soundtrack (a chord-heavy piano score) suits mood well. Again, it’s slick. Gilroy touches interesting themes. We’re reminded role lawyer represent client – necessarily see justice done. But cost, draw line? There layers too, Gilroy lightly plays fantasy sub plot. However, Gilroy keeps main story within realms possibility. In post-Bhopal world – ‘cost-benefit analysis’ acts corporate doublespeak profits human life – film’s U-North different Union Carbide? Similar ground covered – recently Michael Mann’s ‘The Insider’ (1998) Gilroy manages keep things fresh simultaneously harking back great American thrillers 1970s. And course, picked Oscars too…
