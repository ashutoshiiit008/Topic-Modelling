By virtue intense audio-visual medium cinema is, always certain emotions situations bound make sort dent heart, matter final cinematic outcome is. So, bitter feuds best friends, unrequited love ilk always effect hours thing field vision cinema screen. Aditya Sarpotdar’s Satrangi Re film moments abundance, virtue film never totally unwatchable. However, film rarely manages rise rather persistent mediocrity screenplay. That combined rather wishful generic directorial effort mean Satrangi Re settles lazy weekend watch telly, nothing more. Set Goa, Satrangi Re essentially rehash Rock On. Rego, Yezdi, Nick Jai form ‘Goonj’, promising local band aspires make big national scene. On side, three four also final year engineering students. Each set problems stem respective social financial backgrounds, apart obvious problems aspiring musicians well engineering students would face. With unforgivable runtime two three-quarters hour, film easily 30 minutes long good. While Adinath Kothare Rego clearly focal point story, four lead characters actually gets ample footage, bit detail backstory audience usually bargains for. One must confess number scenes film audiences would able connect with. The frustration faced parents son doesn’t appreciate sacrifices made education, plight son turn, isn’t able impress upon parents true calling life – recur film form lead characters. However, scenes deserved treated far precision, able stay audience hours film over. Senior actors Vidyadhar Joshi Uday Tikekar, play Rego’s Jai’s fathers respectively, picks cast. The four main leads fairly easy senses, little typical terms look attitude. Amruta Khanvilkar vivacious RJ Alisha looks pretty usual change plays character suits her. One biggest letdowns film music. As case Marathi films, music pleasant. But film music almost another character, film deserved memorable music. Satrangi Re energetic, youthful feel throughout manner shot. Goa’s beauty captured well, though would much better Goa’s character personality captured well. Ultimately, Satrangi Re appeals spurts. When one walks away film, feeling one gets director Aditya Sarpotdar obviously wants be. But least films actually is.
