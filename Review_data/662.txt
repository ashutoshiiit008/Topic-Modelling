Though might break regular "little story-dance-comic relief-repeat" routine, story told atypical backdrop. Of course, Rajasthan covered beautifully umpteen times earlier. It's slightly unusual "little story", justifiable "dance", restrained "comic relief" make different. Although different isn't always good, time around is. The mature treatment given kids' movie good enough give extra brownie points. Samir Karnik certainly start acting classes children. The performance extracted debutant Dwij Yadav one best I seen child artist long time. Unfortunately, can't said adults. Fortunately though, adults don't much screen time (yes Bobby Deol too! Now go watch movie?). And none them, graciously enough, tried over-shadow Dwij. It movie whole team let way. The structure story pretty conventional. Problems presented first half, resolutions sought post-interval. The pacing rather interesting - ultimately drawback. The problems presented subtly slowly first half feel nothing happened far. As last hour begins, wonder going wrap everything little time. Of course, bring closure everything, understandably quickly. My issue first half interesting, second half sort-of dull. I blame largely avoidable, although endurable, preachy set-up. One could claim need story, became boring. The long shots town Jaisalmer beautiful, seem repetitive. The lighting night shots lake exquisite achieves romanticism intends to. The close-ups however seem artificial. Watch clever editing used cover Bobby Deol's dancing non-skills. And despite relatively simple choreography employed. Music title song "Kesariya" shockingly unlike music director. It might similar others' music, one. And recover shock, back trade-mark Himesh Reshamiya crooning "Lamha Lamha", "Akhiya akhiya", "ulfat ulfat". Given repetitive use repetition, need I say lyrics? Or maybe it's Himesh's musical requirement. Never mind. Ultimately adorable movie made equally lovable kids' story. The endearing bit sport "what kids know?" attitude. Of course, done laughing fact Bobby Deol presented best star Bombay produced. Soon enough, begin admiring taking unusual project.
