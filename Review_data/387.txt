Harud (Autumn), directed talented Aamir Bashir, isn’t easiest films watch. Set autumn Kashmir around time cellular services set launched strife-torn state, tells story family lost one son grappling tormented other. Poignant confusing equal measures, film discussed far run time film; film sure polarized opinions, ranging called sensitive beautiful, found slow downright pretentious. Harud rare film, however, I’d recommend, even I’m sure whether person I’m recommending like not. Rafiq, surviving son family, focal point film. Essentially directionless, life seems slowly take meaning picks something belonged brother. Without giving anything away, best thing Harud journey Rafiq takes finding brother’s belonging actually using first time. Co-written, co-produced shot Shanker Raman, arguably one India’s best cinematographers today, film’s real victory lies manner captures life Kashmir. No wide, sweeping shots capture beauty Valley here; Harud intimate that. It close-ups, long, hand-held takes faces, actions life truly bring essence must like live beautiful place, yet terror hanging head like Sword Damocles. The film, however, suffers key flaws, bring film considerably. Primary amongst performances. Even though every character looks part completely, acting quite wooden stilted places. The dialogues often sound like read out, rather felt characters delivered. Also, seems real clarity exactly makers film trying convey. Yes, angst families living Kashmir, fact youth looking escape life, little nuances life Kashmiri, these, more, film abundance. And fact clearly, intention draw attention visible treatment. But, visual appeal apart, seems particular reason lot happenings film. For example, I enjoyed every one long, beautiful tracking shots Rafiq bicycle, I can’t claim understand exactly many film. While uninspiring writing poor acting potentially cripple film, Harud, come across aberrations anything else. The long takes compensated edgy camera-work, bringing sense urgency despite slow pace. The cinematography one reasons I never found film slow all. Minimalist every sense, film virtually background music, relying sounds Kashmir create emotions would otherwise created music. Harud kind film need submit to, immerse in, order enjoy visual emotional experience is. Personally, I’ve seen number films set Kashmir before, truly first film made want actually live there.
