Right start The Imitation Game, central character Alan Turing speaks voice-over, asking someone (as well you, audience) pay attention whatever going follow. This act, trying coerce audience paying attention understanding what's said & shown, either blatant stating aloud case, repeatedly reinforcing already established fact event, perhaps biggest problem Morten Tyldum's film. It happens time throughout. If avoided, time devoted, instead, unpeeling facets Turing's personality, film could masterclass make period biopic. Then again, film currently, still makes racy, engaging, times even heartwarmingly funny, experience. Based life mathematician Alan Turing, whose work designing building computing machines played large part Allied Forces' victory Nazi Germany World War II, The Imitation Game works stunning real life story Turing, well Benedict Cumberbatch's impassioned portrayal man. The brilliant minds usually belong loneliest, eccentric people. Alan Turing one would consider 'deviant' ways one. While bulk film spent Turing's work cracking codes enciphered German machine Enigma, film also flashes back Turing's youth intermittently, get know bit Turing later years. He unsung hero longest time, Turing; film emotional, edgy always intriguing. The film also touches upon number sensitive topics seem relevant today back Turing alive. The casual rampant sexism existed back then, instance. Again, scratched surface. Eventually, film make point man machine think differently, even two different individuals think differently. Logically, follows right wrong, clear moral social lines, despite history society conditioned us believe. The Imitation Game gets period look feel spot on, perhaps biggest contributor making truly immersive almost throughout, Alexandre Desplat's background score. Though isn't original sounding score around, always works tandem emotional timbre scene, playing role glue hearts audience characters. Then, performances. Benedict Cumberbatch consumes Turing (or way round), every twitch, every mannerism seeming like came somewhere deep within. It isn't flawless performance, one see shades Julian Assange performance well. But soul clearly overshadows craft, leading thoroughly effective portrayal. The gorgeous Keira Knightley, crooked teeth lanky frame, warms heart performance balances strength vulnerability. Like I mentioned earlier, one can't help get feeling film doesn't seem want go Turing really like deep, deep inside. It delves plenty facts, yes, could much powerful Tyldum hadn't chosen make simple story seem like complex tale. The deepest, darkest layers Alan Turing, seems, destined enigma, much like man himself. This film life, though, well-crafted, gripping film.
