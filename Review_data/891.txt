I've problem films heavily bank particular theme provide technical background make attempt weave main plot. In case, it’s game "Teen Patti" (a reduced form Poker, I believe). Replace gambling background field protagonist expert voila another film - Fixing games sports, organ trade…o-kay I'm getting crude, see I mean. There absolutely attempt showing us game system around works. I'm asking lesson, I know writers actually interested film's premise. Without details, master plan looked like peeping people's cards figuring better hand. Some genius. There ample attempt making look sound interesting, rugged glamorous sets needed. And psycho-babble life, happiness sundry. But that's remains trial - work. The thing worked Amitabh Bachchan's acting, then, last time didn't? And would I want watch film many options feature. The rest cast including R. Madhavan usually good job convincing us character, shudder-inducing. Anyway, it's like well-written characters. And this, despite gray. None outright villainous surely don’t aspire heroic. They given non-caricature-like distinguishing feature, isn't taken further. No details, nuances.

They try maintain balance, team members going wrong plans getting trouble. But soon becomes pattern easily see through. And whole justification carrying one silly scheme pretty bonkers too. The basic, basic premise taken 21. Of course, makers wanted feel creative, protagonist sub-plots changed around. Too little, early, middle latter parts too. Only gets fragmented ridiculous progresses towards climax. There ain't meat concept, story, sub-plots. The thing keeps going complete write-off Amitabh Bachchan's acting. Is enough? This once, doesn't look like it.
