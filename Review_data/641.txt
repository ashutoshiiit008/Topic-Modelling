The first sequences film pretty dreadful. I actually worried downplayed Baghban store me. Older generation = good. Younger generation = bad. Soon enough morphed something completely different yet predictable. How managed something see yourself. The problem none done interestingly. Dialogues clich√©d thus even yawn-worthy. The situations given ample time establish equation various characters. But, none great impact. Individually characters though interesting nuances. The villainous ones shade good went naturally personality vice versa. The prospect watching Anupam Kher, especially it's likely serious, exciting me. But there's nothing special act here. Its neither performance worth applause would receive negative feedback. Sharmila Tagore charming self. Divya Dutta took full advantage extra space afforded played bitch perfection. But ultimately over-dramatizes towards end. Rajit Kapoor didn't anyting exciting convey characters intentions clear. The rest cast needs serious acting lessons. A huge irritant song playing random moments, sometimes back-to-back. The music ear-sore, picturized awful fashion. The lyrics - least ones I could hear without awful music distracting - decent. The music lyrics two distinct entities. Usually 'different' concept, climax makes breaks film. Here cliffhanger interval trashed movie me. It predictable mundane audience cursing theater. The bold climax didn't redeem film. Despite characters behaving exactly built far. And that's shame. Because fact huge step defy prevalent social norms. And thus, yet another promising story-line becomes martyr hands ambitious director. The one wants film story close heart finds obligated stick commercial norms song-dance-drama routines.
