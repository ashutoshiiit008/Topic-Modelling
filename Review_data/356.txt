Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl terrific piece pop-lit; racy thriller forms setting audacious characters great insights people relationships. Although narrated completely first person, always trappings film - film would truly take making. Some David Fincher's popular films adapted novels, penchant making films outshone books. The expectations Gone Girl, naturally, roof. What get mixed bag - film neat little thriller viewed standalone entity, rob many, many gob smacking moments book offers you. A man comes home one day discover wife missing. Naturally, needle suspicion him. As battles cops public perception prove innocence, slowly see story couple unravel. Gone Girl draws go. Hope seems sucked right first frame film, Nick Dunne goes lose wife. Ben Affleck suits character beautifully; alternate outer personality - product upbringing - inner despair, things begin go south rather quickly. Then, there's Amy, get know early diary entries. Rosamund Pike looks lot like one would expect look. But somewhere, seems like essence character lost. We get see Amy does, hardly get know feels. In fact, seems sorely lacking film deeper understanding relationship Nick Amy. What made fairytale romance special, went wrong? The answer, course, lies two characters, it's pity hardly ever get see together screen. Any relationship goes test time, truly justify Amy disappeared, would worked infinitely better film got see made Nick Amy tick, didn't. There David Fincher's deft little touches, though, add beautiful little layers film - watch out, instance, accessories embellish Amy's pencils writing diary various points. Trent Reznor Atticus Ross's dissonant music score another facet aids film's overall sense unease discomfort. Here India, censor board ensured film wee bit annoying watch, strange pan-and-zoom method used mask violent sexually explicit content - essentially, image blows shifts least offensive part frame awkward manner, ruining much experience. Gone Girl still makes gripping watch - mysteriously unfolding tale, cast largely suits characters, genuine insight complexities human thought. However, truly enriching experience, I strongly suggest read book watching film.
