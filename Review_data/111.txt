An editor bigger scissor screenplay better sense part story deserves much screen time, would made movie one better movies year. It obvious makers ran time using possible cinematic liberties rush content last half-hour. This one clearly target audience Baghban, might appeal wider range viewers time, people 30-40 age group also identify characters. This one rare movies second half much higher standard first. It might dialogues. The first half Salman, Salman Salman grunting lines. But, second half left mesmerized real boss, Amitabh Bachchan. Rani Mukherjee shows audience acting looks gorgeous, especially less make-up. It’s sad elaborate lines used sketch characters rather facial expressions body language, top actors disposal. Hema Malini looks great given dry performance. To Salman Khan’s credit though, specific thing - get grin acting whatsoever. He deliver comic lines really well. That’s movie starts - light, romantic moments. Some executed well absolute rubbish. But post-intermission, even though pace slackens, emotional scenes portrayed lot sensitivity. The movie worth watch see different characters handle grief. These sequences surely bring tear eye. The title song, composed sung Amitabh Bachchan simply leaves speechless. Once get fact songs don’t reason there, begin enjoying them. There couple really good songs ‘baawri piya’, ‘har manzar’, ‘bebasi dard ka aalam’. “Chalo chalo” foot-tapping, sweetly picturised number. The lyrics small notch usual unimaginative Sameer fare. What really went wrong then? The dialogues. There really good dialogues, find actually implanted repeated later senseless melodramatic effect, say is, “Oh God!!”. Not once, twice… oh well, I lost count five. Then inane sermonizing dialogues repeated passive active voice, like teacher would drill point students’ brains. The tedious length lack-luster dialogues fail retain attention despite good choice subject.
