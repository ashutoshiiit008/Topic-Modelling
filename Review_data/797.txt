This love story nothing unique it. The two protagonists equally adorable characters, want different things. Therefore, audience forced take sides two good people. This indeed interesting novel concept us audience. Also, good thing non-unique subjects easier larger audience identify characters. But, unfortunately, whether dialogues, theatrical acting, slow pace, direction, combination all, I didn't get involved enough care much either characters. Interestingly, I curious Gulaabji's (Rani Mukherjee's) character. It could Rani played really well one got good lines. The dialogues outright tedious. Especially monologues given Ranbir Kapoor. Both lines actor trying hard charm. He seemed treading thin line cute coming across mentally retarded. And even though really good making use puppy eyes, Ranbir shouldn't asked giggle wriggle. He certainly shouldn't asked dance behind semi-transparent towel, light thrown "appropriate" direction. I know-I know, elsewhere, I appreciated female audience taken care appropriately, quarter-monty sake it? No, thank you! Sonam dull lines expressions looked like programmed loop - sad-smile-giggle-happy-glycerinated eyes-repeat. But chemistry Salman Khan really good. She look really dainty touch-me-not quality. But, I would really liked see fewer layers make-up. My guess would look prettier. The one thing I enjoyed lot songs. Sameer's lyrics shade better average. But, music nice soothing (except title track). There something way songs recorded made take note singers. Kunal Ganjawala's voice gives songs required energy. The group choreography fresh. But Ranbir alone screen things became really hilarious. He unique Dev Anand-meets-Raj Kapoor-meets-Shammi Kapoor-meets-Prabhu Deva potpourri dancing style obviously ends weird. However, use colors contrast, lighting different rest movie. All put together made songs enchanting watch. Speaking enchantment, know way Sanjay Leela Bhansali make movies grand sets. It's fetish; it's like choosing best-looking font starting work document. He knows look artificial, once, picked subject would give excuse use grandeur. He made fairy tale. Even keep disclaimer mind, nothing spectacular sets. The entire movie shot within one studio setting. To maintain tone, long shots wonderland animated (with toy train running it). But beauty captivating two seconds. A barely interesting subject combined unnecessarily slow pace makes movie just-about watchable. The main characters sweet, muscle pull through.
