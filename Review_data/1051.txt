Why supposed entertained suspending sense reason? Why laughs considered "worth it"? Why "time-pass" good enough? Why one forced sequence another called script? Why comedy dictating situation, instead comedy flowing situation? Save couple one-liners there, there's nothing enjoyable slapstick. Unless kind enjoys patting able accurately predict writers store. The male cast surprise, exactly every slapstick. So, bit well, many viewers would object choosing worthier scripts. Except Feroz Khan. It almost felt like makers didnâ€™t think anyone cast worthy first billing. So got Feroz Khan blow trumpet justify take lead opening credits. Katrina Kaif fulfills expectations. She satisfactorily basks glory light thrown giggles fill lack lines. Mallika Sherawat hand, seriously well designated flirt movie. Technically movie plain awful. To start off, makes liberal, blatant, shabby use blue screen. It might acceptable first two. But combination third visuals disastrous. The camera work, especially beginning, looked like cameraman testing properties wide angle lens. The non-existent editing adds woes. Continuity gets step-sisterly treatment little often. No effort seems taken even match colors shots sequences. Some songs chopped absolutely abruptly too. Not mention placement makes sense whatsoever. And waste Malaika Arora's dancing skills! Why refuse spend decent choreography instead cameraman's voyeurism? Okay, don't need answer that. I trash another slapstick. What could expect person can't enjoy masala movies even disowning logic?
