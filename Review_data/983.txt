For mere mortal resist, magic Michael Jackson Before I begin, I think would wise state review going little biased, ardent fan Michael Jackson. This Is It film could been. From March untimely unexpected death June, Michael Jackson crew busy preparing would comeback concerts (after 10 years) London’s O2 arena. What followed, approximate two hours movie, glimpse went rehearsals. It would amazed audience really it. This Is It documentary. It music, performance. There fireworks, aerial dancers, majestic costumes, astonishing visual effects incredible choreography set Michael’s classics like “Billie Jean”, “Black White”, “The Way You Make Me Feel” “Thriller”. It enlightening see young dancers he'd chosen go tour look camera tears eyes thank describe he'd changed worlds they'd ever even met him. It made wonder interviewed death. The production notes said movie made 100 hours rehearsal footage I doubt appeared rehearsals handful different days, judging Michael’s clothes. And I hope it's true Michael really saving energy voice actual concerts said movie, even though sounded moved superbly 50-year-old, looked tired frail sequences. As movie went deeper, nostalgic feelings me. I 9 years old Michael toured India part HIStory world tour I would elated MTV would become MJTV hours, playing numbers, part tour’s promotion. “They don’t care us” evoked breathtaking performance number Mumbai 1997. But throughout melodious documentary, melancholic, uneasy sentiment lurking. After wrecking brains long, hit me. What missing audience. We used seeing Jackson’s concerts spectators going wild hysteria. Girls sobbing uncontrollably, people fainting. That used magic, madness Michael Jackson’s concerts. All absent rehearsal footages. And made feel sad. It somehow coupled fall artist years owing eccentricities finally death. “This Is It” facilitated highly nostalgic farewell world glorious artiste. It splendid souvenir genuine fans late king pop. And I would optimist refuse believe created purely monetary purposes. RIP, Michael.
