Singham desperately wants highlight power numbers. Especially number actual people frustrated system become part of. Singham says, believe power nothing unachievable. Well, first story wants us believe, nothing beyond "united" people - media, police common man. I'm going complain simple Singham's solutions idealistic too. The problem is, wagon uses make point. It action comedy. It cool inside theater forgotten outside. To top off, "smart action" parts, you've already seen trailers. Singham would worked little better little action one already seen I remember complete awe muscular Ajay Devgn running slo-mo, getting swinging jeep. It creative held attention. The entire feature though, held together slow set-up, choppy flow unbelievable character transformations make climax. It weird assess particular sequence character like concept what's playing laughing far-fetched actions reactions. I guess it's wish things happening true. Other things though, immensely likeable elements Singham. One ofcourse, Ajay Devgn. He plays quite-in-words, loud-with-action Singham lot energy. Prakash Raj plays arrogant, "egoistical" Jaykant Shikre good dose humor. The rest cast supports two whatever needs done get film 140 minute run-time. These characters, lines given them, set-up find say, "we cool laugh us, see care." They play childish pranks other, mock mimic other, bring popular film references regular conversation. These things make Singham little regular good cop-bad goon drama. The good good bad bad, less, remains so. The hero good, villain bad don't believe either still want know good going get soup evil created. Anyway, maybe gray shade business films like this. Who wants "in-between" corrupt politician needs beaten up? Singham represent frustration nation going through. We desperate. We want solutions corrupt government. We darn aggravated want suspend disbelief trust came together crack long-overdue whip system. So, cheer Singham goes job honest brave. But Rohit Shetty doesn't want us forget it's film. He makes sure "out-takes" end credits. All coolness fake; it's films. In real life, can't better online petitions candle light vigils.
