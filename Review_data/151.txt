Black Friday well made movie; technical aspects par excellence live expectations genre. The acting best, background music well used, locations sets seem real could be. But narration style gripping all. This movie advertised movie 'the truth'. So there's usual gore, regular torture prison cells, typical yelling pleading associated crime, investigation thereof. The strange thing single cop bribed inquiry don't see one politician movie. Was really easy police get information act terrorism portrayed movie? And way, movie 'the truth', movies show greedy police officers politicians claim fictitious, etc - actually telling truth! These dishonest people bureaucracy figment imagination! The movie one police officer, one terrorist one victim. It bomb blasts. It dispassionate, non-judgmental account. It like reading newspaper, gives details way things supposedly happened. Of course, visuals language much graphic pictures print. Kay Kay Menon (Additional Police Commissioner), Pawan Malhotra (Tiger Menon) Aditya Shrivastav (Badshah) full justice roles. But characters (except Badshah) sketched well non-linear presentation help. In fact adds confusion long list names inter-connections. Also, exactly aim here? Is tell world, "this ammunition smuggled India, terrorists trained, planted"? There nothing shocking answers questions. Obviously, bomb blasts, someone-somewhere got raw material organized whole operation. Is aim, then, tell Hindu Muslim fascists God wants? If easy convince fundamentalists, wouldn't half problems world now? And I surely hope aim tell Tiger Menon Dawood Ibrahim, "We know thirteen years ago?" By way, middle this, I supposed feel bad terrorist? No, I certainly don't expect every movie list aims objectives. But, serious movie caliber, much clearer purpose needed. Especially previews bold, red letters black background read "the 'real' contender Oscars", little documentary expected. Unless, course, hoping nomination "documentary" category.
