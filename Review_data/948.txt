I'm sure times, mind works moments, switching threads without connection, fluttering around various compartments lives. The Last Lear appears peek writer's thoughts. We get glimpses playing one other. Only, glimpses enacted talented set performers have. What about? Broken trust? Guilt? An inside look passion man feels art? Manipulation another equally passionate artist capable of? The lives three women one incident marked lives? A comment working women treated men irrespective economic strata come from? To bring difference plays cinema? A little bit each, whole lot ultimately nothing. Now, whether aimlessness result Utpal Dutt's writing way adapted screen Rituparno Ghosh Co. - I don't know. What I know comes across meandering place. And undertones I interpret way contrived even mention here. The word 'realisitic cinema' mentioned movie. True characters situaions seem real. But there's one thing I don't understand so-called 'realistic cinema'. Granted, save us bright, eye-torturing color saturation. But painting jaundiced yellow make real? The nicotine tinge wouldn't bothered much relationships given apt attention. Also Shakespeare verses sounded mysterious meaningful. And since I couldn't decipher mystery, I sure hope used context going story point. Maybe parallel narration could blamed adding patch-work feel. But, I liked know Harish Mishra (Amitabh Bachchan) bit-by-bit, sewn together memories various people knew warmth one feels him. But that's narrative style; character more-or-less one-dimensional. Similarly know superficially, characters going particular day. Shabnam (Priety Zinta) confident yet vulnerable. Vandana (Shefaly Shah) masks tender devotion arrogant poise. Just Ivy (Divya Dutta) doesn't react doesn't mean she's dumb heartless. Yet, I feel cheated, deprived knowing more, knowing better. Despite this, actors perform passion. And Amitabh Bachchan. Priety, Shefali, Divya convincing movie characters Harish's. This certainly I've seen Arjun Rampal's facial muscles move - actually it! What shame taken long!? Sir Bachchan - I say? That performance eloquent, voice modulation articulate, body language mesmerizing, diction immaculate, talent...? Such shallow words are. Overacting? Maybe - scene there. But, I awe, rubbing arms get rid goose bumps audition director. This spite unnecessary out-of-place melodramatic lighting camerawork. My favorite moments switched Harish Shakespearean character back looked like single takes. 'Moment' - that's key word throughout. As Harish mentions, "you never know 'the moment' come". And see trying hard create perfect moment. But engrossed that, motivations characters movie remain blurry.
