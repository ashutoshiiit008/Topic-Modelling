You aren't expecting reality film titled Luck. To top font chosen title diamonds U jets make horse shoe. There's still hope character's life passable amount luck. But almost ALL characters insurmountable amount luck except it's enough enough mullah. But purpose, see. It's play "biggest game". And thus starts "reality show". And interval. Yes, entire first half shot like setting characters. And second half shot like setting situation, story. I hope idea isn't sequel "Lucky again". But one means every character, every event, every frame stylized. It looks smart. But excess anything bad holds true too. It gets tiring overbearing. It likely, least chance style would worked film shorter. But luck! (Damn! Can I please say 'No pun intended'?) The issue individual episodes story predictable, though overall story was. Not mention extremely cheesy obvious one-liners also translated every while. The voiceover first five minutes good give away non-sense come. Also looks like challenge word luck synonym thereof every second sentence. And unfortunately, writer won! An action flick, supposed thriller - don't really expect ace acting. And that's get - non-ace acting. It disheartening see Danny play second fiddle, especially last I saw Frozen. The rest usual bit. Sanjay plays don-like role. Imraan Khan continues Kidnap Chitrashi Rawat Chak De! India. Shruti Haasan plays sex appeal I guess, works. Acting I can't see. Ravi Kissen insufferable sleazy character. Do feel love hatred characters? Na-a-ah! By way, warned para sort-of giving movie away. But infuriating writer serial-killer character (possibly rapist) escape death sentence also respectfully set free! (ba-izzat bari, ....!) Seriously, premise broad sub-plots interesting indeed. The execution isn't bad either. But details terms characterizations dialogues pits. And makes cry sanity. And climax mother ridiculous climaxes. Even film far away reality, climax seemed completely place.
