No one, (yes, including me), walks watch Yamla Pagla Deewana expecting intense experience strong story line. Everyone good laugh, come out, laugh laughed. And scene two stick head, even out, bonus. Even expectations be, I found funny entertaining bits. I'm talking earthen pots pausing mid-air pseudo-Matrix fashion. Only lamely put away Sunny Deol's "dhai kilo ka haath." Creativity, element surprise filmmaker. The actors, well, whatever Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol (today's) Dharmendra do. I worried I wouldn't able hear dialogue middle hooting. But wasn't concern all. The trio louder beyond that. After all, supposedly prerequisite genre. Kulraj Randhwa's role exists sort coherence planned chaos film is. As usual, I disheartened see Anupam Kher role demeans talent. The blatant disregard 'writing' department obvious I cannot really complain character establishment Dharmendra Bobby Deol conmen absolutely nothing rest film. And many glaring disconnects. In mayhem, pleasure listen witty lines strewn across brought occasional smile. But way little film short 3 hours. Presenting nonsense art form. Watching entire Deol family dance one frame idea entertaining nonsense. Other that, action sequences stylization - two reasons one would consider watching film - lame could be. The interesting thing though whether think film going - hardcore silly entertainment love brainless torture senses - expectations fulfilled.
