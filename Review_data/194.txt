The world aspiring actor (Shahid Kapoor) big bad Bollywood. His tiny failures making big-time LOSER, mini-successes adding nothing substantial. You heard again. You've watched least 4 times year. But hopeful still told way you'd enjoy; sorry guy appeal you; you'll feel bad him. But makers Chance Pe Dance don't care enough get involved, there's nothing much give maybe eye-rolls. Just Shahid Kapoor beginning grow actor completely irritated me. The faces pulls, way carries annoying. Genelia D'souza regular chirpy-bubbly self I wonder we'll know anything else. Sure, occasional emotional moment here, nothing remember by. Can I really blame her? With regressive role written her, much girl expected do. Tina, budding choreographer plays, supposedly good job. She begins like guy life ends? Why? Or maybe trying comment undying love woman capable of. Though way story narrated, I doubt writers lofty aims. Laziness, loads of. Okay, lets' assume detailed characters something writers mind. They wanted create story opportunities take make break you. But, unfortunately, lines film lame last line I wrote. And events film functional episodic. They don't flow other. They come go convenient. Now, characters going behave like you'd expect to, going spout lines, ad verbatim what's playing mind, story bound predictable. There's attempt deviate norm. What's left backdrop film. Both Sameer Tina supposed awesome dancers. What I know watching film Genelia Shahid awesome aerobics. Dancing? Maybe we'll wait another day, another film. For now, let's say entire team got moves wrong.
