Superficially Mirch collection short stories underlying theme adultery. But throwing theme shameless betrayal face, covers lot ground. We scandalized sexually expressive female characters, rightly call 'bitches'. This shock example inappropriate think women articulate sexuality, let alone use act upon needs. The short stories replete sarcasm hypocrisy inbuilt man-woman relationship - mythology modern. The double standard also subtly creeps audience's mind. For example, without taking offense (I'm woman that), I started making character judgments women. Though smart thought feet, ace-class calculative. Only suddenly, Ruchi (Shahana Goswami) remarks stories pro-women. And struck me, men film equally manipulative. Only scheming doesn't come fore ...because what? Stereotypes men allow devious? Lead ladies hardly ever portrayed conspiring films, unless vamps? That's slyly film makes think. The characters argue amongst behalf. They shhusssh possible criticism bringing objections four shorts themselves. The others make counter-arguments. Usually, I get annoyed films that. Justify faults saying loud. But, slid here. Mainly content shorts. And something connect four dots, right? On side, Mirch also talks struggle writer wants differ standard. In fact, underlying theme wit get places, applies side-plot too. Deftly, writer Maanav (Arunoday Singh), textures stories accordance producers demands. And making points Mirch fun sit through. It could've solely stood tall clever stories. But lovely performances to-the-tee casting add entertainment quotient. I thoroughly enjoyed colors used accentuate differentiate mood setting. The lively colors Panchatantra short stories complete contrast browns blues modern stories. And set black whites hues connecting segments. Similarly narrative lyrical musical folklore portions sort-of stone-hearted harsh modern stories. One nagging issues film absolutely unconnected parts put together flow. The connection look forced. Mirch passes hurdle. The bigger concern climax. And conclusion slithers like snake. Left smile questions I happy left unanswered. Despite sexual undercurrent, none shorts erotic. They aren't vulgar, aren't beautiful either. They made uncomfortable "too much one thing makes one sick" sense. But, watching film. While walking out, things film pointing came one other. There also pesky question, "by liking film I subscribing fact sex sells?" :D Also, walking out, I overheard couple. After longish silence - He - Thinking movie, no? She - Goodness, going make everyone suspicious. He - It's movie one watch alone. The couple thinking discussing. And struck - film also warns get complacent relationship.
