Pyar Ke Side Effects pleasantly presents phases average urban man-woman relationship goes – hooking up, breaking up, making up. The script stick basic aim narrating light neat story narration loses focus first hour. The hooking phase kept lively humour making part short thus sweet. However, breaking phase drags, characters become predictable really sad see silliest things. The characterization lead pair pretty accurate, i.e. man Rahul Bose’s situation mind-set would behave like Rahul would woman Mallika Sherawat’s shoes. Rahul also speaks us movie done great job switching talking co-actors us. Mallika girl-next-door-face, I can't see hype about? Her dialogue delivery acting (if actually call that!) plain. However, rest could get hearts thumping, oh I see… However, see talent, Rahul’s comic timing pulls movie through. Unexpectedly though, two together look fantastic. For change, intimate scenes lead pair makes us feel couple actually attracted other!! The actors ignorable; either loud flat. However, strike us immediately dialogues perfectly suit characters first half movie. It towards intermission, dialogues start losing charm fact become tad redundant. The concept Rahul acting speaking us intermittently carried bit far thus ends repetitive non-entertaining end. The direction style different, unfortunately different necessarily always best. Some really funny lines analogies lose effect number times mentioned. The dialogue-writer needs understand, got first time! The supposedly touching scenes really impact. The music doesn’t much ears, especially people night club culture. The choreography isn’t exciting either. What sort-of saves movie fact story doesn’t waver smooth right till end. The costume designers make-up people need special mention characters dressed like party 24x7. Thumbs story, Rahul’s acting, costumes. But great opportunity lost didn’t look like enough attention paid departments.
