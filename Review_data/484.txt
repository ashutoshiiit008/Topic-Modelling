Parental pressure, business-politics-underworld nexus, child sex abuse course, love revenge many themes John Day wants talk about. It turns none expressed conviction. Not I asking long lectures powerful drama, engaging tale would do. John Day, like trailers promise, starts fine suspense. Three-four threads run parallel keep guessing. The connection elusive, yet reach lose interest. It blends together well too. But, along way, various themes John Day tries reach become one many good. Also, takes way seriously. Sure, humor would feel completely out-of-place, grim texture film makes much important really is. The story doesn't really warrant film two hours. Not like it's surprise, Naseeruddin Shah's performance keeps audience going. Yet, character barely shades much do. Fortunately, get able support Randeep Hooda broods well. The downer, course, we've seen Naseeruddin Shah much better Randeep Hooda nasty bit already. I actually liked Vipin sharma's performance too. Elena Kazan though stuck like sore thumb. In fact, entire romantic track character Randeep's lengthened film way chemistry warranted. On hand, give take Naseeruddin Shah Randeep Hooda hazy. The dots don't connect. If interested enough to, is. There pretty gory scenes seem like exist shock add inherent value. Similarly, themes child sex abuse parental pressure seem forced rather blending in. It boon then, song dance routines added mix. But, background score seem little confused horror thriller. Besides decent performances cinematography cynically witty lines meager takeaways John Day. The need thrilled shall wait next one claims thriller.
