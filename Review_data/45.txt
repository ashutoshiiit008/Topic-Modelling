A mega-bomb blast hatched heart Mumbai. There jihadis involved. And serious issue completely ripped apart laughter audiences. That exactly lightly unlikely subject terrorism dealt Aage Se Right. The title would meaningless without logo. A straight run no-entry lane film about. To start off, there's terrorist (Kay Kay Menon) cop (Shreyas Talpade) least suitable professions. It's spoof first sequences. You sense something darkest possible ambience created first scene. My usual complaint spoofs name satirical tend things spoofing, exaggeratedly. Both writer director refrain HUGE bonus audience. Of course, haven't able avoid completely. To start jokes predictable. Then, stereotyping people various regions country done ad nauseam Hindi films. There coincidences anywhere close reality Mumbai. Also, there's film set whose crew annoying. Add flashback, character transitions, token roles women, bad animation, clich√©d climax - could name satire, didn't entertain make point. There's customary joke targe every third film days - media - receives another thrashing old way. Enter creative dialogues. Aage Se Right hilarious lines I've heard real long time. A couple made burst laughter rest time I wide grin across face. The situations added scope dialogues. The entire idea Mumbai underworld Don teach pure Urdu speaker Mumbaiya dialect Hindi name "correct" language hilarious didn't get tiring till end. And add little things happening ambience - sign boards, costumes, mobile phone ring tones colors used - contribute humorous vein. The contrast rough gruff Mumbaiya ultra-clean albeit outdated soft Urdu unmistakable. The comparison underworld organizes corporate world comic. I also enjoyed analogy Dinkar Waghmare's (Shreyas Talpade's) character superheroes. It's always fun see Kay Kay Menon switch comedy otherwise serious role. But one, complete laugh riot. And completely utilizing perfect diction. Can miss character's frame mind actor like Kay Kay. Cool clown, Shreyas Talpade timed lines perfectly. Though script requires little loud, manages annoy co-character frame needs annoyed. The balancing might tough one. A couple character actors done well too, rest going drill. It's since I've enjoyed spoof much. The constant stream funny quips Kay Kay Menon main contributors. It good weekend watch, necessarily rush theaters keen certainly cool DVD watch.
