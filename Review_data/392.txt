You innocent looking child. He poor. He work hard. And see gleam eye something unreachable. What's like stories like these? Especially reasonably decent performances. Hawaa Hawaai yet another story inspires reach passion. At time, It attempts sensitizing issues child labour Mumbai slums - nice, even little in-the-face. It yet another story watch. The problem words "yet another". Hawaa Hawaai's story "been there, seen that" feeling it. The melodrama doesn't help case. And preachy undertone, borderline beats purpose. The good thing is, every time goes one zones, manages get back track pretty quickly. In fact, even makes points rather subtly, contrast style thus far. The writing simple. The story doesn't dig deep characters, even try create many ups downs. In fact, first protagonist Arjun aka Raju (Partho Gupte) sees came way I thought, "isn't happening easily him?" The beauty don't mind things working easily Arjun. His character situation built it'd wrong sympathize condition instantaneously. Yes, film pretty judgmental audience. It wants educate. It wants sensitize. All noble, except gets patronizing every while. Fortunately, combined effort actors, doesn't allow patronizing become overwhelming. Partho Gupte's earnest performance; Saqib Salim's enthusiastic one; knowing irony four kids Arjun's gang bring together don't allow get bogged overt effort sensitize. I also found intermittently tuning lyrics songs playing background. One, way many them. Two, music wasn't great. Three, lyrics predictable. In case, I take kids watch one? Yes, sure. And hopefully, contribute efforts inspiring form social responsibility them. That - Hawaa Hawaai might perfect for.
