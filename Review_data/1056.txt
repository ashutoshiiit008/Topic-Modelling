Let's get obvious complaint way. What's Rashee? long, super-long, super-duper long. No. Just "super-duper long" wouldn't enough. It needed build-up, it's long! AND despite that, it's outright bad film, keeps "undoubtedly great" one. Oh, well… Let' get second-most obvious thing film. This time sure positive one. PRIYANKA CHOPRA. I'm usually okay people agreeing opinion film/performance/etc. But, I really surprised meager handfuls won't like Priyanka Chopra film. I enough guys going siggggh gals going wow (including me) every time screen. Her performance(s) brilliant one charming character another. The third-most…Gotchya! You didn't think I giving list top 12 things What's rashee?, you? But I I'd guarantee, paragraph sounded talked different things. Which 12 Priyanka characters here. Yes, almost 12 characters charming, couple different norm. But rest follow format. There's something want groom-to-be not-to-be know Priyanka's 10 minutes screen-time revolves around issue. And extremely interesting first times obviously tiring that. And two different exaggerated true. Which pretty much true entire story-line too. But basic premise forgiven since already watch film, right? And despite asked more. We accept dad's selfishness brother's foolishness, silly pundit weird uncle, prop sister-in-law I'm-here-to-lengthen-the-film aunt. Ooops! I almost forgot Harman Baweja. I surprise I want say, I think guy well. He needs chance he's over-shadowed star co-star. But, one woman, right? Wrong. My issue so-called women-oriented films also well "so-called". While one characters today's girl mind own, looks superficial. Because, she's still man's support needing wants one's approach convoluted. And ever "throw around one guy other, I care man I want get married to", one. Wait climax react comment. This writer's thinking process looks like. "Yo! Priyanka Chopra one helluva actor. She needs film revolves character." . . . "But, don't know write women-centric stories. Damn! That someone star stature." . . . "Let's go options explore. 7 days week, naah - sounds ridiculous. 31 days month - way many. So 365 days year question….hmmm…" . . Research - research - research (am I giving much credit? Well, man made supposedly extensively researched Jodhaa Akbar, didn't he? Anyway... . . "Hey, look here's Gujrati novel Kimball Ravenswood Madhu Rye. Yay! Jackpot And made TV series theme pretty popular, remember? Mr. Yogi? " . . . "Done, then! Since we've get Priyanka act real well, she'll sell. The director leave rest cast thing, snort, fart, smile, whine, whatever. And focus lady." . . . "Hey, wait! 12 girls one without break become monotonous. Let's throw couple side-stories. Which ones? Don't matter. Say Don theme extra-marital affair theme. It'll break flow bit. Doesn't sound good? I said "Don't matter!!" It don't matter even don't give closure. You watch…" . . . "What else? It's masala no? We need songs. How many? Of course 12! Can't less, one Bhavna, Hansa, Anjali, Chandrika, Sanjana, etc, etc, etc feel bad? Can't risk that!" And have. An extremely mediocre product Ms. Piggy Chops. True, songs nice, well-picturized different too. But 3rd one gets little blah! And many, songs lip-sync involved sound repetitious too. Gone days Mr. Gowariker Hindi film audience thought found money's worth film touched 180-minute mark. Rest assured we, audience, won't think less movie doesn't move average run-time films around world notch. Yet, it's boring. So, viewers better equipped handle length home luxury "fast forward" switch disposal non-Priyanka parts, course. Oh yeah opening credits one best I've seen Hindi films!
