The Indian mom gets due Hindi cinema. Finally. No educated, job-and-home juggler, modern 'aaj ki naari' (Today's woman). This one whose full-time job makes homes, one humble 'small' business side rest world willing dismiss achievements. The woman never found expression confidence, one day slight window opportunity opens up. English Vinglish takes opportunity ever-so gradually talks us, family, responsibility empower her. While keeps atmosphere light lets spend 5 weeks Shashi (Sridevi) gorgeous homeliness. Yes, I saw mom, nani (grandmom), aunt, cousin countless enterprising women Shashi - warm, modest, coy, technically uneducated sharp women. She underexposed world outside yet mind broad, attitude simple clear would make urban seen-the-world, know-it-all snots ashamed chauvinism. She put closest affects deep love support others might offer. Her pride hurt see swallow hurt even take blame keep harmony. She beats up, stuck "should haves", anyone else could get chance. And yet given chance, meek, submissive lady fly high somehow manages find freedom. If guys think women's film sounds touchy-mushy. You might want watch empower women life see world eyes. Sridevi brings complexities within life simple Indian woman grace elegance. Even total 30 seconds, dance much graceful many today's top actresses put together. Sure, squeaky voice distracting enough make wonder Urmila Matondkar dubbed not-so Marathi lilt Hindi. The constant stutter/hesitation lack confidence character demands seem little repetitive. But gorgeous eyes make that. And I don't mean shape way made up, convey, emotions stir within. I don't know whether thank disappointed made typical housewife, larger life. I doubt could achieve weren't provided material play with. Quite parts simple story manage convey lot relationships dynamics even though minutes spent terms time. I especially enjoyed Shashi's relationship son character spirited mother-in-law. On hand, gay effeminate character caricaturish charming, romantic French man good true. But, that's takes balance positive attitude towards sexual orientation subtle, cross-border love, it. The characters like say husband daughter stereotypical male chauvinist ruthless teenager. However, realize stereotypes find place every household variation. And don't necessarily instant change outlook within 5 minutes. I loved pace English Vinglish goes it's business. No rush, great strides cover lots ground. In fact, half-time, you've seen whatever know trailers terms plot. Shashi Godbole put knowing English. And wonder going close threads hour. Yet, haven't gotten bored. Even it's entirety plot slightest curve arc. I'd liked better I didn't know punch lines trailers them. Also, another slight sore point tend get little preachy, even gets masked conversations real-life speech situations. I also wonder it'd see Shashi living India, without using American 'support' system anchor. With come question importance given English language English Vinglish. On one hand, I could get distracted supposed moral story, overt emphasis language. Because, surely Indian home-maker Pune, get without HAVING know English won't lose much face either. The exaggeration made make point. But Shashi's need learn English mom's want learn driving grandmom's drive learn play harmonium age 75! It's English car musical instrument. It's confidence, it's independence, it's didn't get then, it's proud finding self-worth, it's feeling good yourself. And rest us, it's giving space so.
