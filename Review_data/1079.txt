When hear Salman Khan saying, "Ram jaisa bhai" (a brother like Lord Ram) reflex action rub eyes check entered Rajshri Productions' film mistake. But eyes witnessing Sanjay Leela Bhansali set-up. So, Hindi film enthusiast set get dazed dazzled. The advantage though contrast story characters simple be. You know simple means, right? Black white. And eventually black turns white. Sure couple characters like lawyer (Mithun Chakravorty) maternal uncle (Anjan Srivastav) make wonder black white bit. But lose interest. The writers clearly want take sides, don't give enough details bothered. Neither I made really care main characters. 2 4 (Salman Khan Zayed Khan) losers - sore ones that.
