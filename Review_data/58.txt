Rustic, grainy look. Immense style. Everything else wannabe - story, acting, thriller. There isn't even attempt get us hooked. They try hard, really hard get us curious. But doesn't work. And unfortunately, get feeling think succeeding feeling good it. So situation 6 people lost memories locked clanky, metallic setting. No one knows who's who, including selves. Now doesn't strike odd? No? How I tell even watching whole movie, identities known all, wouldn't matter one 6 character. The personalities pretty similar other. Age bar, sex bar. Even interchanged will, reaction would still uninvolved, "oh ok, say so." That bothered react already spent good 100 minutes film already. Of course there's much could done situation, especially memory loss angle. But, na-ah, wrinkle forehead brings. You least interested who's done whom. And it's difficult point is. Maybe narrative style chosen. I usually enjoy two threads running together especially set apart time. But here, doesn't it. Whether lackluster story happened history whether current situation overkill drama lame story background, I don't know. Both parts, maybe. The non-performances don't help either. They actually made Dia Mirza shriek. That's fair. She carry action role, lady also emote, make character prop? The long list equal length roles plain plain. You got give marks choice texture film. Whether movie shot done post-production little concern audience impact them. The effect pretty cool. And that's it. You enjoy first 10 minutes what? There's nothing else watch for. Finito. So, yet another nice concept goes drain. This time there's nothing concept chug film forward. Oh well, waiting Diwali releases already.
