The heart - allowed behave like child; especially it's lhhove all. But unacceptable allow kid - however grown-up might - write full-length feature film. The situations amateur play words childish. If convinced low standards story dialogue writing first two hours, watch (if going watch is) down-market climax. Within first minutes film, three lead characters problems presented you. This done plainly non-creatively possible - true rest narrative too. It literally Ajay Devgn's love story - cut - Omi Vaidya's love story - cut - Emraan Hashmi's love story - cut - repeat. Within first rounds, predict next cut story going take you. To next three characters whatever upto next. Only that, whatever happening life next pretty much similar happened last. Ajay Devgn clueless, middle-aged boss falling helplessly love girl almost half age. And keeps falling love. There's nothing world actor required do. Emraan Hashmi (they call Abby) playboy -- surprise! -- always thinking next girl take bed. Even likes one others, seems like one aim mind. A been-there-done-that too. Omi Vaidya (Milind Kelkar) simpleton proud it. Once falls love lets woman take ride. Again again. Omi's performance almost repeat 3 Idiots character. Also timing completely off. He actually couple good lines completely given away way said Now apart repetitions, constant nag. I rooting one. Not even good-natured, squeaky-clean-at-heart, aawww-so-sweet-that-he's-boring Milind. And I think lot timing. Maybe maybe, lame lines I complaining might tolerable delivered quickly comedy requires be. An extra pause here, moment thought puts ailing dialogue sleep. In midst dreadful writing, disproportionately refreshing see sort-of variety character couple women film. Not details deeply thought through, since performed reasonably well, provided relief otherwise plain narrative. Tisca Chopra woman going mid-life crisis Shraddha Das woman misuse people around source relief - characters much actors themselves. On hand, Shruti Hassan flattest dialogue delivery ever got damn annoying even smaller role compared others. And difficult judge Shazahn Padamsee act chirp, "please please please please please." Sure, character requires that, save judgment gets real dialogue. And what's Madhur Bhandarkar paying tribute films? Just wondering glimpse Page 3 Corporate coincidental, witness ramp walk jail thrown too. Sure, attempt face self-referencing directors manage. And though sort-of weave film, still distracting. Oh yeah, trademark referencing homosexuality too. But time around really shoddy stereotypical. Madhur Bhandarkar's trial exposing big-bad world love turned 75-minute wait interval followed another 75-minute wait end. You don't care how, don't care why, care when.
