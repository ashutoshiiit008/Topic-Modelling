Terence Malick’s Palme D’or winner Tree Lifedemarcates audience two – kind patience watch tree grow years kind keep coming back every 10 years quickly monitor progress. But kinds acknowledge magnificence tree. Tree Life film unfolds slowly. In passion, whispers, colors surrealist imagery tries tell story family, grapple life death. But it’s grim existential crisis, movie talks nature grace (personified father mother, played Brad Pitt Jessica Chastain.) The imagery all-encompassing poetry. We pass life family living American suburb 50s, eyes younger son, Jack (Sean Penn), struggles find answers brother’s death, mother’s soft charm, father’s disciplinarian demeanor cumulates life. We bustle old-school visuals watercolors, smokes, liquids, paints dyes – take us symbolic, colorful magnanimous process life originated. It’s montage waterfalls, erupting lava, amoebae forming, reproduction every species every aspect nature scanned beautifully. The refreshing twenty minutes film, mostly visuals old-school thankfully aren’t subjected high-end visual effects graphics. We keep sifting patient extravagant shots nature, life general intercutting visuals O’Briens' lives. It’s film life, it’s preachy film shot manages take breath away. Coupled gospel like background score divine cinematography, audio-visual experience almost sublime. However, narrative structure leisurely repetitive; feel like slither water color, trickling slowly possible, never stopping moving sporadically. You’ll notice religious undertones redemption forgiveness, you’ll see life supreme being’s eyes, you’ll also zone amidst lovely visuals film basically like extremely poetic sermon. Some words stun you, inspire, bore you. If you’re looking glimmer intimacy, inspiration awed naturalness life, Tree Life gives that. The film motivate cleanse soul, introspect, restructure life around beauty world that.You’ll need lots patience move film.
