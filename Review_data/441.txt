Possibly discussed debated films year, clear favourite Oscars, Inception arouses strong urge get mind Christopher Nolan, similar way one wanted get mind Wachowski brothers watching The Matrix. Once inside, want ask simple question, "How hell think something like this?" The story unique arguments Inception puts forward dreams, reality human sub-conscious almost entirely convincing. Nolan mounts premise edge seat thrills, gravity defying action ensemble interesting characters, brings something unique table. Inception tells story Dobb (Leonardo Di Caprio), skilled extractor valuable secrets dwell subconscious human brain, finish one last assignment meet kids. Cobb's technique called extraction: entering person's dream, stealing existing idea vulnerable dream state. His latest assignment however challenging one, called inception, plant idea, rather steal it. Dobb however challenged past must confront conquer dreams, able pull task. Leonardo convincing Cobb, team assembles. Ellen Page, plays architect Ariadne, responsible creating world dream, almost sleeps role (no pun intended). Joseph Godron Lewitt plays Arthur, makes fine transition chocolate boy Dobb's suave partner crime. The big surprise Marion Cotillard, plays Mal, formidable nemesis Cobb. She's graceful, eyes deceptive doesn't take long dislike character. Tom Hardy, plays Eames, uses charisma good effect, delivering best lines film. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack responsible big way maintaining constant state tension throughout film. There's fear, desperation, doom, helplessness, exhilaration, satisfaction - genius induce versatility common theme music. In conclusion, Nolan ties loose ends, many, since narration linear, devoid many flashbacks experimental jumps screenplay. He also takes great care simplifying idea inception layman. Cobb's explanation dreams architecture Ariadne spectacular, clearly one visual highpoints film. In Cobb’s references ideas significance them, Nolan touches upon bigger issue - theft idea, intellectual property humans yet exercise copyrights. Some say geeks eventually rule world. My feeling geek right firewalls brain will. Why, another film released year,The Social Network lawsuit theft idea. Inception also made ponder human beings change mind, decided something. Why it, presented idea that’s immediately acceptable, say, “It’s okay. Let’s sleep over.” What exactly happens sleep, potential change way feel something, morning after? And not, helps us keep first impressions intact? Inception significant film Nolan's career, proves acclaim The Dark Knight flash pan. With film, cemented place alongside likes Spielberg, Cameron, Scorcese. The fact he's much younger gives cinegoers great future look forward to. One reasons I keenly looking forward DVD film, hear Nolan's thought process shaping story, converting film, convincing folks Warner Bros. back it. Unfortunately, DVD, despite two-disc set, give answers. The special features additional disc, "Behind Scenes" either. There even detailed interview film-maker, cast crew, reactions producers thought heard film's story first time. Fans Nolan would clearly wanted see much him. Inception certainly commands least second viewing. I've seen thrice, I've able spot something new occasions. In first viewing, film seemed story mind-heist, introduced rather radical believable invasion dreams. The second viewing, made seem story man’s struggle get back home kids. The third viewing (which happened DVD), convinced security subconscious may radical concept all. But worried more, realisation, viewing, we’re cheering inception, robbery, Cobb says “is strictly speaking, legal”. We live strange times.
