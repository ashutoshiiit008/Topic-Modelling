Leave brains home, phrase I detest. Unfortunately, I keep hearing regard many illogical films resurfacing late. As much I wanted make protest loud clear, I realized might bit premature. We brainless entertainers, assuming term brainless means different things different people - precisely I thoroughly enjoyed slick, pointless yet charming Knight Day. In Knight Day, Tom Cruise plays Roy Miller, CIA agent mission. He meets June Havens, average neighborhood girl (assuming average neighborhood girls look like Cameron Diaz) Boston Airport, uses mule carry important device, begin adventure. He whisks Boston Brooklyn Caribbean Austria, she’s involved mission, fight mafia, FBI miscellaneous villains. It’s typical Tom Cruise film – you’ve got love it. While film gathered less negative reviews, got thinking – since Tom Cruise films go fashion? He’s stylish, easy please, charismatic presence makes forget logic relevance. But who’s complaining? We jump state state, mingle flirty-ness (which admittedly little damp Diaz Cruise). Each escapade later, Roy comes back June, saves perennially radar, find falling again. How not? Even Diaz, wide-eyed feminine glow makes smile. Well, maybe find feeling indifferent overt charm film oozes, flaws stare eye. For example, character apart two seems developed. There’s tons pointless action, superhero moves Cruise's part (hey, I’m trying neutral here) all, every plot point film guided illogical band-aid move throw forward. For example, you’ll notice every tough situation, Miller suddenly drug June, escape face situation. Cut to, June opening eyes home next day aren’t told situation handled. The DVD fascinating extras – hold breath – it’s called “Wilder Knights Crazier Days”. Some rib-tickling interviews Cruise Diaz, followed on-screen bloopers also look stunts Cruise Diaz themselves. The latter interesting watch, watch Diaz take car stunt first time, Cruise, who’s known stunts himself, breezes through. It makes film much believable fun. Director James Mangold (of Walk Line fame) seems agenda straightened out. Knight Day great looking pair, crazy (flirtatious charming) dialogue, theatrical action sequences charm, charm everywhere. The adventures dramatic, top ridiculously comical – good way (also depends chose see it). If you’re mood it, Knight Day give exactly want. It’s genre brings nothing less table – question flaws, enjoy nonetheless.
