Simran Raj grown up. They crossed hurdles past 15 years, face new ones. They left deal terrorism racial divides. Director Karan Johar grown shows respect growing audience too. There isn't super-sappy emotional drama. There over-the-board filmy dialogue. There aren't frolic-y dances. All HUGE plusses. But, every melodrama takes quick peek, end takes over. The lines aren't super-mushy still belong Utopia. And background score takes gap left song dance sequences. If I could give marks improvement director, movie deserves garlands, accolades, awards, more. Surely, something sappy "We shall overcome" gives goose bumps, director done something very, right. But, movie rated mistakes didn't make, credit would taken away films don't intention making first place. And argument could go round round circles. Well, let's focus did. I wondering, need bring "autism" angle all? And I realized film wouldn't engaging wasn't part whole schema. Shah Rukh Khan, would Shah Rukh Khan. And zero-tolerance that. But, character, Rizwan, suffers syndrome gives Shah Rukh completely different material deal with. The permanent cock-eyed-ness, no-eye-contact character entire length film, restricted body movement - keep attached Rizwan far way Shah Rukh. And kudos latter that! :) No people, purpose making Rizwan suffer Asperger's. Hereâ€™s person difficulty identifying emotions let alone expressing them. He follows one guiding principle, "That good human let bad enter him." Now, person low EQ knows that, head heart allow bad things happen world. Beautiful, ain't it? Unfortunately, anything high sentimental content give way sappiness. Though, Karan Johar team writers manage keep huge chunk film. The last 40 minutes complete lose sanity. The moment see mother lost son change whites child lying still house, know film little hope, on. Though, ironically, it's trying say hope. Add drop, super-shrill Kajol throughout film. The lady's voice high-pitched she's excited/happy piercingly she's upset/sad. Considering that, two main characters whose personalities exposed to; actually heartbreaking see zero chemistry two. Save couple "moments", romance love story. However, see lot romance camera subjects. The arid deserts, city sky-lines, general magnificence US covered beautifully. The puller-downer almost like shot makemytrip.com advertisements. Given this, I might urged wait DVD first two hours film would also equally vehemently urged skip last 40 minutes so. But given "illogical" conditions revolving around release film, I'd say - keen support entire team My Name Is Khan go watch theaters. It waste money, time, energy certainly waste courage.
