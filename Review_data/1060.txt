No matter strong fast get, can’t outrun inner demons. And Logan stranger, darker demons, far longer boot, people – classify ‘people’, is. The brooding, sombre mutant back, he’s still haunted ghosts past. Despite Logan being, distance, personal favourite character X-Men series, I must confess I didn’t many expectations The Wolverine, far many X-Men films coming far soon, world strictly requires. Besides, years back, director James Mangold managed impossible making first Tom Cruise film I dislike, Knight Day. I’m unsure, then, low expectations fact actually film merit, I quite enjoyed The Wolverine. For one, far lesser action one come expect X-Men film, indeed, film based Marvel/DC character world. The film focuses Logan, character - mutant whose gravest problems stem deep within – past, present seemingly perpetual future. With film set Japan – mostly Tokyo, moving outskirts, The Wolverine also flavour Japan undoubtedly superficial, one works favour. Capturing flavour country city distinctive culture largely unexplored territory Hollywood film genre, thus makes refreshing change film. Indeed, entire narrative The Wolverine took slightly aback much focused character surroundings, rather VFX-powered set pieces. The latter film quite well executed well, without bordering action-porn, films tend days. Watch out, particularly, imaginative riveting scene top thundering ‘Shinkansen’ – ubiquitously known Bullet train – again, something quite typical Japan. It helps, course, towering presence someone like Hugh Jackman hold film together. After Robert Downey Jr Iron Man, Jackman actor made comic book character much it’s hard imagine anyone else playing it. Also, watching incredible turn Jean Valjean last year’s Les Misérables, respect actor increased tremendously, intensity shines The Wolverine well. Every performance around Jackman, though, stilted effected jars. The pace narrative isn’t breakneck, yet film never pauses lingers around pointlessly either. The runtime two hours thus seems perfect. To round off, film also looks good – despite bleak, de-saturated colour tone, makes generous use solar flares, always seem improve look even averagely shot film. The film wider 3D release 2D, it’s likely you’ll end watching 3D show. The 3D isn’t particularly great, doesn’t hamper film either. Of course, post-credits scene look forward well, intriguing little teaser Bryan Singer’s X-Men: Days Future Past, summer 2014’s big release. So, you’re absolutely fed big franchise films OD VFX action, could give The Wolverine shot – wee bit different usual. If nothing else, Logan - Hugh Jackman - almost adamantly keep things interesting.
