Finally!! Finally, treated like people thinking capacity taken granted audience. Thank Mr. Rajkumar Hirani entertaining us wonderfully!!! This movie non-violence is, contradictory may sound, contemporary. It using Gandhian principles deal common man’s current day-to-day problems. And beauty script, preachy! Smiles, laughter, misty eyes, tears abundant sides screen. Munnabhai Circuit adorable, articulately sketched characters. The characterization maintained songs – music lyrics right simple sweet choreography. Not Sanjay Dutt Arshad Warsi play characters living them, also felt like enjoyed every bit roles. You sense energy. The chemistry exceptional, especially scenes two – dhobi ghat outside. Vidya Balan’s smile brings freshness screen, especially paying tribute Robin Williams (Good Morning, Vietnam). Boman Irani playing bitter-sweet character comic timing right ever. Dilip Prabhawalkar’s voice modulation spot kudos make-up person too. Familiar faces Munnabhai MBBS bring warm memories first movie Munnabhai series. The songs, change, add value script since lyrics almost songs situational. However, means may make sense listening them. The story script skillfully avoided certain things. For instance, generation gap problem used, psychiatry element left unexplained, love angle go misunderstanding misunderstanding. It also refreshing see unnecessary show snow Switzerland using dream sequence excuse. This product excellent teamwork. The director could done without actors turn could done without dialogues lyrics, course dialogues would worthless story script, first place could ruined improper execution director. Of course, nothing life perfect, right? … lapses worth ignoring. There little extra melodrama, extra tears, couple improbable coincidences, overestimated use World Space, unnecessary dialogues considering audience treated respect. Also, dancers side could done expressions. This doubt feel good movie, something extra begin experiencing credits start rolling ‘EXIT’ lights turn on. The issues raised stay leave hall (unless course skeptic). All-in-all must watch one all! Thought day – Bapu job, Munna done his, ours?
