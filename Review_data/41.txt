A city seize. 5 bombs threatening go off. The administration, turn, turning resources up-side-down. We've seen lot Hollywood. But, take basic plot, add basic action it, cast wonderful cast could have, arrested - wanting blink once. I like observe titles movie done, way, it’s measure much respect decision makers crew. Many time there's much noise glitter titles forced read opening credits. So, half A Wednesday's titles plain white text black background zero sound, I hooked. There's one scene person threatening set-off bombs close caught. At point, I wondering cool it'd he's actually caught point, wonder story move on. And time, I sincerely hoping escapes. Just case, capture would mean movie close end. I hadn't even realized it's even interval yet, that's much I enjoying thrill build-up. While introducing characters us, A Wednesday also takes digs influence "stars" film industry, gender bias society, "creation" news media, general attitude law order officials. Along way, comments impotency law enforcement department (though, refreshing see room full committed police officers). And final bang, smartly, plot uses impotency make right right. Just less 24 hours ago, I applauding director's effort give Anupam Kher non-loud, meaningful role. And movie protagonist. Sure, doesn't require go whole range expressions actor - particularly one - capable of. But gives back - audience's - respect. What I say Naseeruddin Shah - I left speechless character's confidence angst, whether ill-placed not. Even though, thrillers necessarily best genre display acting prowess. Anupam Kher Jimmy Shergill I call soft faces film fraternity. However, stern characters, expect soften sooner later. But strong attitudes here, see Anupam Kher even Jimmy beat someone up, don't question it. Both writing performances complement other. The smaller side characters also charm. Like, young self-made hacker cute. Yep! I actually found geek adorable. Speaking which, except amusing graphics screen, technical talk didn’t sound like mumbo-jumbo. The melodramatic background score used create suspense overdramatic slo-mo stylization Naseeruddin Shah's character things irritated me. From tone movie otherwise, especially muted titles, I got feel excessive drama based creative decisions heart director resorted supposed to. Surprisingly though, speech climax didn't get tiringly preachy. That's mostly motivations sounded novel yet believable. Anupam Kher Naseerudin Shah - truly pleasure see screen together, sirs! That thriller...
