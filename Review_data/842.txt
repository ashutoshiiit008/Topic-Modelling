Paradise earth battlefield? Religion Politics? Military militants? Individualism greater cause? Both, both, both. And yes Sikandar deals them. Or least tries to. Only deft hands justice complexities issues involve without oversimplifying it. And oversimplify film does. That lot loopholes. Despite though film decent overall look what's happening because, like it's said, heart right place. Kashmir turmoil. We know that. How many times think people live there? People like me. What happens kids growing orphaned - soldiers jehadis - collateral damage cause? What collateral damage caused psyche people living - way life? How altruistic harbingers peace messengers God? Piyush Jha, writer, started nice acceptable connect-the-dot game. In overall picture, dots, characters place - common man, opportunist jehadi, calculating military, "impartial" religious leaders, crookedly ambitious politician back common man. We know dilemma singular aim faced one given his/her situation. And sensitized situation. But unfortunately, links connecting way many breaks, especially film progresses. Things handed easily completely indigestible. Yet many fascinating facets. The vulnerability pettiness directionless youth easily influenced be. The tyranny people think working larger purpose nothing serving personal aspirations. And politicians, us, including Sikandar self-centered self-preservation goal. Guns belong soldiers that's be. A man denies girl tears â€“ capacity cruelty need illustration? And even glaring, on-the-face climax leaves future beautiful part world hands youth - grown experiences last weeks, might matured beyond age due situation adults around put in. The problem overall picture, isn't much going right Sikandar. Apart full holes, story pretty much predictable. Though it's difficult say director's intention cue audience in. Because lot acting gives away ensuing "twist". Parzaan Dastur playing lead doesn't seems carried dialogue delivery style Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. And Black's Ayesha Kapoor manages convince us character, Nasreen. A lot issues completely off-sync dubbing. I wouldn't surprised I told actors didn't dub themselves. Also, R. Madhavan Sanjay Suri barely role showcase skills know have. No doubt, low-budget film needs applauded shooting Kashmir. I liked times camera moved like soft wave. But, surely must ways capture beauty take touristy shots dawn dusk. I can't resist thinking, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy saying, "itna paisa mein itnaich milega" (Channel V Adage, you'll get fee you're paying me). Just didn't believe credits I saw them. Also, background music nice some-or-the-other tune playing full run-time got annoying. It felt like I wanted time-out enjoy Kashmir peace. Despite shortcomings, I'd still want watch Sikandar, maybe one needs rush theater fair watch nevertheless. Just bring one inch closer (quoting Madhavan's character, Rao) heaven "man shouldn't touched" albeit safety homes.
