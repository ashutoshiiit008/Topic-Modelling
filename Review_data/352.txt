"You given power Almighty 10 days life. What do?" No, question beauty pageant, actually you'd really like do. My bet first thing normal person would mend life. And that's man, Arun Prajapati (Salman Khan) too. So, sense, realistic. Yet, God tussi great ho comes across aimless jumps one sub-plot another, doesn't make strong comment human nature, meaning love, state politics things pretends address. The quirky style comedy Salman Khan Suhail Khan works getting smile every while. The kind dialogue delivery weirdly placed pauses combination zero body language, makes even serious scenes situations look funny. Unintentionally funny course. And even though it's slapsticky 40 year olds behaving like 14 looks way silly place. This manage keep drama quotient low, low don't feel characters emotionally charged scenes it's tad high stylizing characters. Amitabh Bachchan, course, lends grace elegance movie general. But, movie requires hold knowing smile through. Nothing much done, God smile follies. Priyanka Chopra, main lead, squealed jumped appropriate times. The sad thing is, character introduced intelligent person movie progressed, introductory episode seemed like sake letting us know she's smart. That trait didn't come anywhere later movie. The side-characters seem superficial - Mr. Prajapati Sr. (Anupam Kher), Mrs., daughter, maid, lottery ticket seller, beggar, office peon. They significant enough roles recall value, none depth needed make believable. Anupam Kher made laugh couple times didn't convince middle class, government servant background. His wife wore saris suit character body language accent like socialite. So many characters translate many sub-plots. Since isn't necessarily direct connect main story, side plots stuck together one give movie jerky feel. It almost feels like story never written paper, narrated drink finalized. The movie dated feel overall. The sets, songs dances, special effects donâ€™t look like belong past 3-4 years production. The special effects complete waste reserved shoddy, glitzy song. It'd much better money spent creatively creating required effect set. Like Bruce Almighty, God tussi great ho doesn't fulfill promising one-line plot idea. I think lot fact God presents himself, expect really great things happen. But, don't.
