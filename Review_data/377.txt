Political dramas need strong message backed power-packed dialogues situations. And addition regular requirement well-thought characters crisp screenplay. Halla Bol instead, regular message packaged shabbily around lame dialogues contrived situations. Moreover, don't feel characters screenplay tedious almost runtime. My biggest problem writing. The transformations characters seemed convenient believable. And applied individual characters groups people well - say media general pulse country's population. The many real-life references seemed like list people situations industry needed caricatured. Just sake it, particular purpose mind. The use flashbacks attempt create interest deterrent me. For already badly written character, unnecessary non-linearity first half added lack flow. Not mention, right beginning events seemed obligatory rather superficial. Each event laboriously explained subtle hints would done job much effectively. There ample scope hard-hitting, forceful scenes but, except two places, opportunities utilized. Again, barring couple sequences, dialogues predictable. And occasions predictability unnecessary pauses, gave audience time think ahead lines. Many scenes way verbose. The decent lines also marred plain dialogue delivery. I attribute flaws director. Because certainly seen much better performances Ajay Devgan Vidya Balan, similar roles. And Pankaj Kapoor decent job, character became across monotonous one dimensional towards end. Yet another issue writing pace. With particular distaste many camera movements pacy editing, I never thought I'd ask quicker cuts. But one badly needed it. The lingering camera became way annoying gave feel immaturity. And cameraman fits creativity, took pretty shots inserted movie randomly. Again, brilliant occasions compelling music lyrics taken dull, lackluster songs. The qawali outright boring. The songs seemed exist movie because. 30-40 minutes shorter, crisper dialogues, better issue address, thought flow events might made better movie. All-in-all loads room improvement direction. The reason completely trash movie seen worse, much worse.
