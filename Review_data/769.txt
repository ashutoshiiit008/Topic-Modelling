RED stands Retired Extremely Dangerous. And Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich & Helen Mirren “ED”. Though movie based three-issue comic series name, pop-ish take it. Since comic-series didn't enough content translated full movie introduced many new characters made movie comical comic-series. The concept movie high-up official tries pull conspiracy taking good guys. But picked wrong lot mess with. (Come on, one messes Bruce Willis! Even fifth grader knows that.) The story however takes back side, it's lead actors shine throughout film make movie-watching experience worth money. The movie stylish action scenes beautifully shot. I've watched scene promos, Bruce Willis casually steps moving car, countless number times, never got enough it. The screenplay average performances powerful. Bruce Willis owns role Frank Moses. One second believable gentle giant Mary-Louise Parker, next second knocking bad guys dozen highly efficient black-ops agent. Very actors come close Bruce Willis comes pulling action film tongue cheek dialogues. I one, 'die hard' fan (Pun full-on intended). Morgan Freeman composed ever somewhat short role. John Malkovich pick lot me. He brilliant role eccentric retired agent suspects everyone everything. And Helen Mirren. Oh, still steals spotlight every time she's screen - gracious ever. Mary-Louise Parker act part Frank Moses' love interest, clueless chaos surrounding life. But knowing capabilities actress, I guess made best told do. She moments shine too. Brian Cox interesting role film, one many shades. He fits character effortlessly. Lastly, don't recall name Karl Urban yet (the new Dr. Bones, Star Trek franchise), you'll surely hearing lot future. After all, going play THE Judge Dredd remake, scheduled release 2012. He plays antagonist managed stand ground pretty well front biggies. Watch him. It's good acting department, fault totally lies screenplay fails keep excited. The lack seriousness works characters fails story. It won't leave awe, you'll enjoy watching it. After The Expendables RED, looks like, many cooks may bad thing. With guys gone, it'll end era action movies. They dictate action supposed done. Watch cast, don't know long they'll hang around. But there's something look forward to. Since prequel comic-series announced, might prequel movie.
