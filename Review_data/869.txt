An unsolved mystery real life many potential climaxes. Our imagination limitation. Writer-director Manish Gupta's imagination brings us plausible solution unresolved case stoneman murders 80s it's interesting one too. Only hiccups form drama. That slight over-dramatization gives audience couple minutes think makes shocker twist "I knew it!" victory moment them. In general, every time protagonist finds corner little room escape makes us want root even harder. And sense claustrophobia doors slowly start closing Sanjay (Kay Kay Menon). Fingers pointed him, unhappy wife, senior might using means end, colleague who's get him, junior who's completely in-sync - stars aligning right make life miserable him. The writing actually reasonably gripping. It twists, turns, re-twists fit short run-time. But needs meat characters. The wife, colleague - could delved into. We allowed nowhere close killer's psyche. Then again, might point movie. Also language used extremely inconsistent distracting. A character speaks Hindi heavy Bombay dialect suddenly spouts phrase chaste Hindi. Most dialogue delivery left Kay Kay's safe hands usually that's good thing. He starts usual exceptional self. It's delight see composure change attentive-submissive he's boss bossy-smug ordering around subordinates. And suddenly gets weird. He delivers lines staged way I couldn't associate - distant look eyes mouthing really bad lines. Rukhsar (Sanjay's wife) looks out-of-place through. Her attire - way cotton sari draped way she's carrying don't go together all. Her character's sub-plot connection rest story. I creeping suspicion she's one ready shed clothes one unnecessary scene fit budget!! You'd think it's thriller given 95 minutes they'd rush. But, na-ah...the camera takes time scan room characters. Usually, I enjoy slow camerawork, gives time soak atmosphere random rather directionless. Not mention, typical thriller-violin-shrieking background. I'd voted tighter screenplay. And since it's short film first place, maybe minutes delve psyche characters would made experience complete.
