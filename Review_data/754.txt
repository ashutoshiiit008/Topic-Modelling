When I say excessive use slo-mo, I don't mean lightly. ONLY scenes dialogue reach normal speed. All else super-slow motion. And aren't many dialogues first place. I'm saying I want dialogues, trying warn almost 85% film slow-motion. Oh first 20-25 minutes recap first episode. The good thing become patient person end 2.5 hours. To lend support story enough meat rounds. The birth death crime never-ending circle, especially crime fuelled revenge - small village Andhra Pradesh nameless society. Whatever case, it's high time people involved step circle see sunshine - Ram Gopal Verma tried say Rakht Charitra Part 1 continues part 2, conviction. There actions reactions based defined characters. When characters see murder one solution kind problem, see clarity (compared part 1) people haven't known way. They politicians judge pros cons, driven ego bears tag fanatic. The story also away characters annoying part 1 - Any mention Bukka (even recap) lady police inspector conspicuous absence. This convinces even Bukka's meaningless violence, prominent Part 1, absolutely gratuitous. The women gain respect, speak mind. They also give brilliant performances. And does...ahem...Vivek Oberoi, ditto Suriya. I would liked see Inspector Mohan character, walked Suriya's inner voice/soul. I think acts accentuated slow-motion too. I don't know it's illusion kind, close-ups slow-motion combination give impression actor held one expression long enough appreciate it. Damn! I already mentioned slo-mo dramatizing everything. Saying tantamount repetition, right? I'm tempted say Bukka's role cut slow-motion done regular speed (even half number times) would easily made one good film. Synergy one? Or Cinergy? Never mind, there's always camerawork RGV films complain about. This time camera circles - no, standard horizontal ones, vertical ones. For good 20-25 seconds stretch, rhyme reason. The first time, I almost thought something gone wrong relay. * "An eye eye, makes whole world blind." Been there, seen that. Way many times. Next. Oh wait, climax leave door open part 3.
