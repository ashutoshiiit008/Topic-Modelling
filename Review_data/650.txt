I wonder director Rob Cohen thought set make film, watching nightmarish experience reviewer! We two Mummy films before, lots sand desert special effects blond Brendan Fraser playing Rick O Connell (a spurious contrived reworking Indiana Jones character), third film series? You put Masala mix; throw everything got hope works. So Yetis, ancient shape shifting Chinese emperor played Jet Li, good witch played Michelle Yeoh (was director paying tribute Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon attempting create similar film?) along hero heroine (ostensibly middle aged retired profession saving world Mummies) strapping son, elixir Immortality: set Himalayas, Shangri La, Shangai, England 1940’s. You also mandatory special effects crude attempts comic relief thrown in. Unfortunately film sinks morass, never rises it. I hopes Jet Li Michelle Yeoh, director leaves nothing do. Jet Li wooden faced clay faced make villain, Michelle Yeoh ten minutes screen time. The big climax flaccid looks like lousy video game unfortunately cannot switch off. The action set pieces highly contrived, nothing new offer terms stunts visuals, fight Jet Li Brendan Fraser put simply, doltish. Imagine Jet Li defeated Brendan Fraser hand hand combat, ha ha! It high time producers stopped raising Undead Mummies, extort money living! Will someone put curse eternity?
