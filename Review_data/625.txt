Miley Naa Miley Hum launch vehicle politician, Ram Vilas Paswan's son Chirag Paswan unfortunately stays - carrying arms tropy heroine, Kangna Ranaut, course. The basic plot charm warm family film ends bland, predictable affair, especially post interval. Chirag Paswan looks sincere long way go face body learn convey character feels/wants say. And I appeal dialogue writers, please, please stop giving Kangna Ranaut English lines - pronouncing "career" "carrier" I'd let go, "means" "mince", please mercy us! The two saving graces otherwise almost debacle Poonam Dhillon Kabir Bedi's voice. Actually, Kabir Bedi couple scenes eyes express everything otherwise dead expression don't convey throughout film. The basic plot interesting ridiculous twist midway, surprises believability left. Had somehow masked twist chemistry lead pair half chance Miley Naa Miley Hum decent film. Alas, another one films you'll stop channel-surfing mode, check Ram Vilas Paswan's son looks like.
