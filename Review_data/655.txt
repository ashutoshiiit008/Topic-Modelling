As regular boy-meets-girl stories becoming common regular movie-watcher, spate dark comedies noir becoming quirky movie-watcher. Interestingly, analogy applies mindless comedies. You need put brain away watch Priyadarshan comedy David Dhawan film, almost much need keep gray cells bay give number coincidences required make "separate threads collide" story. Only difference latter zing cases, quirky treatment. And My Friend Pinto amount quirky, more, different. Just average genre. It's like isn't enough meat disconnected threads played out. It fun cute, deviates chosen narrative-style little way often. What pillow fights people romantically flying clouds film unlikely underworld dons. These dons rather eccentric required type films, portrayal cartoon-ish, amateur make impact. The actors don't seem help cause either, show easily little often slips slapstick mode. Prateik Babbar protagonist, village fool, grown-up man never grew up. And treated night life craziest things happen him. This one required "performance" him, looked like dumb/na√Øve person plays films (other Jaane Tu...). Kalki Koechlin barely role play. I really liked one song Prateik Babbar. That song also picturised well. Watch choreographed water splashing. It's awesome visual. Other My Friend Pinto, regular gets movies directly compare to. We, course, seen worse films general, bracket, whatever My Friend Pinto show covered, whatever say wishy-washy kind.
