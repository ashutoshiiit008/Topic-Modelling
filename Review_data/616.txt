Films start lie build lie lies explode typical fashion thus predictable sense. Mere Dad Ki Maruti too, falls category, doesn't get creative lies either. However, witty one-liners gets couple lead characters involved lies keeps going slightly engaging otherwise. That though, goes missing last quarter film. The co-conspirators suddenly vanish reappear. We assume busy hatching alternate plans. Watching Sameer (Saqib Saleem) dig grave deeper gets little weary. His motivations seem dramatic convoluted. This saved, great extent, sharp dialogue writing. Sameer constantly put father sister gets back way, breath. However, like friend (Prabal Punjabi) points out, way casual supposedly alarming situation in. Such contribution keeping things light. Saqib Saleem, Prabal Punjabi Rhea Chakraborty together keep film young SMSese. I didn't find amusing, felt bit over-done. But, maybe I'm old find funny. The dialogue delivery fast, maybe keeping fast-paced lives young restless live. The one-liners though witty come go quickly, keeping audience toes stay flow. The Punjabi bit tad in-the face. So Ram Kapoor Sameer's dad. It doesn't help clue Sameer put bad him, sister matter. All hear putting-down suddenly supposed believe 'it's family' all. In family affair then, why-o-why cheap dance, performed bride, find place? If exaggerate ridiculously offending lyrics find way family events, bad taste. Such things quick anti-dowry pointer don't gel together. Even so, Mere Dad Ki Maruti decent watch it. It gives couple hearty laughs smile often not. Oh prepared extra dose Maruti advertisement first half hour. Then again, already warned, weren't you?
