How often heard someone say something effect, "Oh, he's artist. It's okay, they're like that!" Sometimes, artist seen slightly different moral prism rest; struggling artist even so. A folk singer Greenwich Village, New York, Llewyn Davis isn't exactly nicest man world. He frequently pisses people off, often takes close granted, and, sometimes, also behaves manner cause described particularly unpleasant bodily orifice. And yet, beautifully atmospheric film Coen brothers - both, visually well aurally - drawn him. He's luck, seems getting worse passing day. Forget knowing next paycheck coming from, poor fellow doesn't even know bed night be; it's 60s winter seems particularly chilly. Inside Llewyn Davis, film, like curling beside fireplace it's snowing outside, favourite book company. It's like listening favourite ballad rainy day. Most all, especially wounded creative soul, like antiseptic-dipped cotton; you're sure it's hurting healing you. When artist displays performs expression creativity first time front audience, time interval end performance first reaction viewer like eternity artist. That moment, seems last forever, Coens capture beautifully Inside Llewyn Davis. And also making smile almost throughout. How much person pushed? How much failure take? How difficult hear someone tell aren't good enough? And worse; start believing yourself? The answers question depend individual, evoke universal emotional responses. Treated way Coens usually do, dark humour visual flair, it's like you're road trip Llewyn, want last forever. You feel music; pain there. Luckily, film treats us full songs, mostly performed protagonist himself. And soundtrack film has! Calling soul-stirring would understated clich√© recent times; Inside Llewyn Davis soundtrack haunting little gem. Prior watching film, I little disappointed Coens' usual cinematographer, Roger Deakins, wasn't shooting film. However, Bruno Delbonnel, Coens' teamed time, doesn't make miss Deakins entire film. Gorgeously shot, film creates maintains melancholy mood throughout, dull green colour tone alternately makes feel warmth yellow cold blue. It helps Oscar Isaac perfect Llewyn Davis. He creates character endearingly flawed want give hug being. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman Garrett Hedlund make memorable little appearances, big small; impressive supporting act film comes adorable little cat. Joel Ethan Coen have, me, one best filmographies cinema. What's heartening see films seem getting intimate, now, without losing makes Coen film first place. For me, personally, Inside Llewyn Davis struck home; because, long sense humour it, there's nothing quite like inside artist's head.
