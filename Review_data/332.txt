Natalie Portman Mila Kunis followed performances challenging Black Swan similarly themed rom-coms. Does Arrenofsky answer one? Or joy part light film? While No Strings Attached (released earlier year Ashton Kutcher Portman) poorly written film, Friends With Benefit sharper better performed. But different account? Friends With Benefit intelligent film. We forced ignore film falls prey age-old stereotypes mocks throughout first half film – lead pair .. pretty. The film revolves around two emotionally damaged/unavailable people – Jamie (Mila Kunis) who’s placement agent Dylan (Justin Timberlake) becomes art editor GQ magazine Jamie. They agree don’t want relationships realize they’d better friends indulge casual sex. Well, that’s revelation. Because really haven’t heard one before. We taken good 45 mins yummy two bare essentials, getting frisky place. Reason 1 like film. The first half funny, smart total win makes want rethink situation went horribly wrong (ouch). You wonder – they’re much fun must actually plausible alternate big L. They flip corny rom-coms TV make fun it, mock exes importantly don’t cuddle, romance get mushy. Reason 2. What ignore see (or made to) Jamie actually die-hard romantic. She claims genuinely believe true love prince charming troubled childhood. So go steamy sessions casual-ness, small part wants freeze near-perfect scenario, know what’s store next half film. Conflict arises, course. It might regular conflict, conflict enough make lead pair question friendships. Yada yada, fights, tears, heavy background music later Friends With Benefit film Timberlake Kunis make fun first half. Clichés abound. The real conflict head. Do like film not? It’s good looking film, Friends With Benefit. Set New York, makes want move live “the good life”. The background score pop music bounce – Timberlake’s words, “makes believe good time watching film”. The pace film crisp, doesn’t allow analyze whilst drooling lead pair. It’s leave realize shortcomings film. Director Will Gluck admits making film wouldn’t stand PG 13, “they (the lead pair) realize they’re romantic comedy story — two regular people aren’t movie would comment on” act accordingly. Hence “reality” - casual sex, denial conflict. But clichéd, mushy end? Oh that’s Hollywood studio’s requirement, I hear.
