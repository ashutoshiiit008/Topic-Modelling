It's Rohit Shetty film. Which smoothly slides Anees Bazmee territory dash Priyadarshan 'comedies'. Oh, I kidding? Soon, I'm going able tell difference. What know sure 100% nonstop nonsense. Either like don't. Or like star involved ridiculous extravaganza not. And time didn't bother writing story. They picked classic yesteryears. Usually 'remake' I try forget/ignore/disregard whatever I know original full justice newer film. But here, try one might, aren't allowed forget likeness. Time again, crudely brutally reminded makers paying tribute to. An exaggerated mimicry Amol Palekar-Utpal Dutt might work once, repeating making constant references highlights inept tribute is. Just calling middle-class doesn't make characters so, right? The way dress, whether shoes make-up deny believability. Oh, I go again! hmph. So Abhishek Bachchan replace Amol Palekar Ajay Devgan replace Utpal Dutt hold back tears. The interesting point despite fact I like Abhishek Bachchan Ajay Devgan actors. And given context film, genre, director timing pretty good manage annoy completely despite characters assigned them. Especially Abhishek Bachchan effeminate Abbas quite racket. What I must say must best respect(?) homosexuality might received mainstream cinema. Sure, laughed least wasn't mocking level acceptance. Some progress. The rest cast expected, loud pretty much intolerable except Asin Prachi Desai try bring sort order balance chaos course aren't given enough room. There's flurry tributes films Karz Hrishikesh Mukherjee's film Khoobsurat. They funny conceptually everything loud disconnected work best stand-alone one-liners. Not mention, even one-liners throughtout film entertaining SMS forwards - jokes times inspirational quotes. No, I don't deny it; I wasn't deaf resounding laughter ridiculous line stuffed stylized delivery. It's like Hindi proverb, 'haath kangan ko aarsi kya' is, 'hand bangle mirror mirror wall?' imagine delivered muscular Ajay Devgan makes sure chest tattoos show peek. Yes that's kind complete disconnect actual proverb, situation hand humor tries use. The humor indeed found disconnect. There couple instances genuinely hilarious. But, rest find laughs silly sounds. I, however, could enjoy humor couple times. Oh, action also letdown usual Rohit Shetty standards. Many sequences sound design, camera editing action instead Ajay Devgan Abhishek Bachchan. Everything over-the-top, loud, in-the-face. There way much room writers give audience leave brains behind. Only that, I part audience doesn't want rather couldn't convinced to. Ps. 'haath kangan ko aarsi kya' means 'you don't need mirror look bangle/bracelet - don't need mirror see obvious'
