One could easily get away saying Agyaat 'real' story. And wouldn't entirely wrong. The one-line description detailed description would pretty much same. But drama post-interval 45 minutes unfolds film shows struggle human being. A struggle natural instinct become animal survival persistence trying keep turning beast. And sets film apart keeps becoming one big yawn-fest. Also jerks - kind horror film jolt seat - done pretty well. Of course, times see camera following subject followed face subject. This though used limitation saves film becoming tiring watch. At last I found use nauseating camera angles RGV film justifiable. The spookiness tries create time works least bits - second half. Pre-halfway film pretty much blah. Nothing much goes story set-up characters. Also enough evidence RGV going bonkers post-production, especially sound department. And yet I wanted cackling audience stop - I understand inevitable horror screen yet I wanted give film chance. Also cliff-hanger interval shakes drowsiness immediately. Even half-time use camera interest people like observing technical aspects film-making. Very smartly film also gives us peek hardships actual crew might gone shooting Agyaat. felt like watching Sri Lanka "Animal Planet" channel - exotic snakes covered close quarters. I'm fascinated flora fauna seeing snakes big screen really excites me. Though inherent beauty Sri Lankan jungles doesn't leave much room creativity, eerie atmosphere created. Despite loud background score's best effort keep horrified. Not music background, songs also obviously fit script pure commercial purposes. Please tell skimpily-undressed Nisha Priyanka Kothari takes make film financial success. Anyway, usual stuff lead lady required "horror" film - yell feel scared - well. That pretty much rest cast too. Like gym workout. Make expression required character. "hold-Hold-HOLD AND pulse-Pulse-PULSE AND 8 - 7 - - 4 - " get drift. Right. Also couple characters irritating traits make caricatures. Though lot grace marks keeping dialogue minimal possible given itâ€™s commercial project. Despite couple scenes could used better dialogues instead run-down repetition predictability. I'd liked subtle hint ambient noise prevail background sound. I want know feels like RGV product. I know Agyaat potential terrify this. It created neither warmth curiosity characters. But I wanted know unknown. And makes end absolutely predictable. Oh well...if RGV could try different tactics stun, wouldn't RGV, right?
