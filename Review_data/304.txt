Paresh Mokashi’s first film Harishchandrachi Factory depicted Dadasaheb Phalke’s struggle make India's first motion picture, Raja Harishchandra. It fascinating story presented disappointing manner. His second venture – Elizabeth Ekadashi, portrays family’s struggle overcome mounting financial woes. Their efforts survive lead normal life could’ve made engaging, heartwarming film. Instead, director presents plot predictable every juncture. The film family gets unexpected financial problem. A widowed mother, sole breadwinner family, strives hard get dilemma. Her kids, however, decide take matters hands support mother. We know story happen next thereafter. Yet, surprised see beautifully Madhugandha Kulkarni’s story woven around Elizabeth – cycle, Ashadhi Ekadashi (an auspicious day). That’s why, matter conventional narrative is, I don't worry long treatment heeded to. Now, cycle called Elizabeth gifted Dnyanesh (a lead character) late father. As every human being, family Dnyanesh finds emotional bond it. Mokashi captures affection wonderfully you’ll yearn more. Alas, weakest directional side spoils whole show. Over-explanatory dialogues over-exaggerated performances biggest bummer Harishchandrachi Factory. And get see imprint Elizabeth Ekadashi well. It’s really hard understand Indian filmmakers question sensibilities rather challenging them. Why can’t let us feel story rather describing us dialogue? Mokashi failed take advantage talented, charming cast. Their unnecessarily staged, not-so-natural performances make think director really wanted way film prefers way default. The characters’ struggle evident throughout film. You feel nothing though. As result, don’t desperately want protagonist succeed endeavors. Because somewhere know might win anyway. Mokashi tries throw surprises, late. His predictable screenplay already done job. At 90 minutes, might look like film short crisp. But sharper edit could’ve surely helped disguise glitches. Mokashi opportunity show cinematic climax would’ve left audiences speechless. It’s shame chose absolutely passé one. Above all, casually directed makes wonder guy whose last film India's official entry Academy Awards. Amol Gole’s cinematography isn't ground-breaking, something I've seen Marathi films recent times. Each scene lit brilliantly adds intensity narrative. Very well done! This story could’ve actually taken place anywhere, director knows soul well. No wonder production set backdrop Pandharpur looks authentic. The visual beauty Elizabeth Ekadashi may mind overlooking shortcomings.
