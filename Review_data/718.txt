Is Players, The Italian Job? It is. But, not. Then is. And again, not. Because, all, Abbas-Mustan product. The twists turns turning turns twists given. The lawn tennis characters play loyalties also expected. You wonder whether makers screening joke good thief bad thief mock predictable. So might able make one four characters mole? We know one ought be, predictable enough, dear directors. So, sitting edge seat business. There thrilling chase wrapped around itself. But, I must admit, twists made plot little interesting, even minutes. Players also lot less dramatized I anticipated. And is, thankfully, less stylized trailers made be. But, isn't saying much, it? I expected ooze substance-free form every frame. So, it's like going miss slo-mos dearth pauses every third word dramatic effect. And since that's pretty much intentional, chance actors give decent performance? Not much hope left set actors. A quick reminder - Abhishek Bachchan, Bipasha Basu, Sonam Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Bobby Deol, Sikander Kher. It shame I good word say even Bachchan Jr. The rest aging worse every film. And boy, over-estimate Neil Nitin Mukesh's potential deliver non-standard role. The reasonable actor ensemble Omi Viadya comic-relief incarnate. A couple one-liners brilliant timing, that's takes remember him. The whole theater laughed loud joke done death sms/facebook/what-have-you! That's remarkable Omi is. But, like Abbas-Mustan film, guaranteed exotic locales shot beautifully. A slick movie, Players surely is. In fact, they've chosen often visited Russia New Zealand, gone close North Pole film crew go too. The sound also contributes making feel like part action. There number scenes feel seat pulsing beat. Yet, Hindi action thrillers miles away Hollywood counterparts, despite smart action camera work. They lack originality. They remain - remakes films. The problem also directors' strong belief adding masala suit Indian palate. I don't get insistence adding song dance, lackluster that! Nor I understand rationale behind going way include comedy amidst tense drama. Just makes laugh, doesn't stop becoming distraction flow story particular scene. And adds fidgety minutes run-time. One things I like The Italian Job makes team strangers common enemy. And fortunately, Players doesn't lose flavor. Alongside tidbit romantic undercurrent. It's good thing kept place isn't much ado it. Abbas-Mustan, course, also add extra load twists. Only time around relatively better attempt tying loose ends. Players might work slight shade better expectations low. Watchable must watch, like many films running TV.
