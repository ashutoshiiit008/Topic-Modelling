Raaz 3 regular horror film. It provides share unintended laughs, goes motions trying spook sudden peek-a-boo devil. And since devil work cannot escape age old science vs. faith argument. Unfortunately, nothing way done novel either. Sure, get see Bipasha Basu viciously negative role wish death upon her. But see trailer, maintains length film. Somehow character's arc sounds way similar Heroine except black magic part, hopefully. If Bipasha plays dark witch, Shanaya, Esha Gupta purest pure whites, Sanjana. Which basically translates screaming getting scared whole lot. This must certainly covered Acting 101, Esha Gupta fine, except times diction goes off. Bang two gray Aditya (Emraan Hashmi) caught seems like duty love. Herein lies greatest folly Raaz 3's concept. Something disastrous black magic supported Aditya flimsy reasons. You never convinced subservient Shanaya's wishes. Emraan Hashmi, must able carry roles effortless ease, especially since gets seal couple problem situations best, kiss. Besides regular stock songs aerobic dances, Raaz 3 expected share scenes meant scare relentlessly thumping background score. Not single 'scary' scenes come shock make edge towards end seat. This despite reasonable dilemma faced Aditya. But, isn't taken far struggle superficial. The 3D used either sake except couple times 'horror' scenes, mention see blur/ghost times even wearing 3D glasses. Everything Raaz 3 feels shallow uni-dimensional. Even character gray Aditya, isn't treated detail. Raaz 3 yet another run-of-the-mill, Bhatt horror film.
