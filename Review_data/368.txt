There something exciting intriguingly gargantuan thought shared cinematic universe Kevin Feige team Marvel Studios bring us every year. It almost seems like alternate reality, one worth surrendering to. So far, we've exposed top rung Marvel line-up, they've mostly fun, rarely, ever, completely disappointing. With James Gunn's Guardians Galaxy, we're introduced ragtag bunch obscure Marvel characters, always going risky proposition studio. Yet, undoubtedly first exciting series films, expected - easily fun Marvel film since The Avengers. A franchise could definitive 'Space Western' generation, Guardians thrilling, exciting, inspiring funny, equal measure. The characters are, want better word, bunch losers. Individually, primary concerns money survival. In larger scheme things, concerns seem almost banal. Yet, motley characters get together, become unlikely eponymous group title. More importantly, come together, seem smashing good fun, rubs audience. So utterly beautiful is, fact despite film set feels like coldest reaches outer space, heroes ooze warmth they're other. Not they're always friendly terms - get know better, get know better. Peter Quill, likes calling Star-Lord even one else does; mysterious slinky assassin Gamora; Rocket talking raccoon; Groot humanoid tree; sinewy beast Drax; really couldn't diverse set characters thrown mix. Their zaniness perhaps biggest strength - one right minds would ever take lot seriously. The plot, like every Marvel film really, evil being, hunting something help gain power. Here, it's Ronan Thanos. (The latter, remember, made briefest appearances mid-closing credits scene The Avengers.) Even though heroes never quite seem wrap heads around it, drawn bid foil evil designs. Yes, impressive set pieces. Yes, CG VFX film top notch. But film primarily works buddy movie. Our characters hilarious, coming-of-age tale, awkward righteousness guiding goal. The dialogues spontaneously top-notch, film dissonant soundtrack one could imagine film genre, one works sheer nostalgia. Peter Quill human character entire film, he's obviously one music works like magic - evoking memories world gone by. Chris Pratt Quill rakish charm him. Zoe Saldana fine Gamora, it's great see Dave Bautista actually hold Drax. Perhaps victim strong previous image like Dwayne Johnson, much easier accept Bautista actor. But laughs provided Rocket Groot, voiced Bradley Cooper Vin Diesel respectively. I've personally always fascinated character Thanos, good see Josh Brolin bring performance-captured life. Guardians easily best studio offering summer, worthy addition Marvel line up. Things going get bigger here, clearly, least percentage plan.
