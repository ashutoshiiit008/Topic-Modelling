Lakshmi's synopsis Bookmyshow reads - Lakshmi, 13 year old girl kidnapped sold prostitution. Thrown horrific, inhuman world raped brutally beaten struggles survive help girls never give in. It makes Lakshmi, film, sound like run-of-the-mill struggle victory story, well might be. The film though sensitizes horrific human trafficking helpless situation is. At time, realise real-life must worse. The bravery one girl, Lakshmi sounds unreal sets film apart - based true life. Lakshmi's bravery real. The narrative feels real many time, feels like documentary. Yet, difficult judge would come brilliant performances - Monali Thakur, Shifaali Shah Satish Kaushik Nagesh Kukunoor himself. You feel hatred towards pimp, Chinna played Nagesh Kukunoor strongly feel Lakshmi Jyothi's pain Monali Thakur Shifaali Shah respectively. Equal weightage given unavoidable crass language. It's curse words brazen lines prostitution related issues portrayed hits wannabe way. It perfectly tune subject hand. When comes stories based real life soulful narration, little say than, "go watch it, need to." Of course, Lakshmi difficult intense watch - women, sure, hopefully men too.
