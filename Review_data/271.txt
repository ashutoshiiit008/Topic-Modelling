~ ~ ~ Update ~ ~ ~ I happened catch Django Unchained DVD here's update DVD features. Here’s thing; like release new Quentin Tarantino movie event, DVD Quentin Tarantino film collectible, matter what. That’s surprises DVDs films always designed packed like other. No matter, Django Unchained great film DVD collection. The pack contains one DVD, film well special features it. The main special feature titled ‘Remembering J. Michael Riva: The Production Design Django Unchained’, 12 minute piece looks back fondly film’s production designer, died film shot. Though nice piece itself, disappoints slightly it’s strange talk film’s production design director cinematographer make even cursory appearance talk it. The two items list special features promos Quentin Tarantino Blu-Ray pack 8 films OST Django Unchained, respectively. Nothing much shout about, promo QT Blu-Ray pack excites promise 5 hours never-before-seen footage. Other features DVD include options Hindi, Tamil & Telugu subtitles. Like every Tarantino film, Django Unchained gets better viewing well. So, really, cinephiles absolutely must copy one either way. ~ ~ ~ Original Review ~ ~ ~ At outset, I must confess I biggest Tarantino-phile you’ll meet. I’ve watched every one films times I count I marveled, laughed, ogled dropped jaw films times people even said name. In short, I’d like believe I Quentin Tarantino Joss Whedon comic books. Or thereabouts. Needless say, Django Unchained film I’ve waited most, two years now. When I finally watched film big screen, delivered exactly promised – cheeky, irreverent, violent, indulgent fun might either love abhor, can’t ignore. Set American Deep South years Civil War, Dr. King Schultz German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, lookout slave named Django who, believes, point three targets. What begins business relationship former slave bounty hunter turns joint hunt Django’s wife, separated sold. While Django Unchained certainly isn’t Tarantino’s best film date – isn’t nearly outlandishly entertaining Inglourious Basterds narratively clever Pulp Fiction - still whole lot fun it. Politically incorrect always (the dangerous ‘N’ word used even ‘F’ word), unapologetically gory violence abundance (but my, beautifully gun battles choreographed!) zany characters charm irrespective side moral spectrum stand, Tarantino writes directs essentially Western (or Southern, likes call it) flourish. Unmistakably though, Django Unchained struggle sometimes film; one big reasons this, I suspect, fact long-time collaborator editor, Sally Menke, passed away 2010. Menke edited every one films Reservoir Dogs Inglourious Basterds, perhaps making person understood Tarantino director, importantly, Tarantino writer anyone. Django edited erstwhile assistant Fred Raskin, doesn’t nearly seem show kind understanding Tarantino’s style Menke did. Something I sorely missed one great, long, slowly unpeeling conversation piece gently builds nerve-wracking tension reaches nail-biting crescendo, exploding usually violent climax. This, I’m sure, much editing writing. Strangely enough, stripping away genre exterior, satirical take slavery usual Tarantino-isms, film also partly something never really made far, love story. That perhaps, also one reasons Django Unchained may disappoint some; perhaps love stories aren’t thing begin with. Also, 2 hours 45 minutes, surely who’ll find runtime tad long. Then course, usual liberties, taken much conscious effort bits genius. So even nighttime scene midst dense forest lit fairly high key, source light becoming question mark pause ponder it. Another frequent Tarantino collaborator, cinematographer Robert Richardson (who, incidentally, also frequently collaborates Martin Scorsese) lights Django Unchained creating truly gorgeous frames mundane visuals. He also uses exaggerated zooms often; something fastidiously avoided filmmakers, often looks amateurish. In Tarantino’s & Richardson’s hands, however, intended – draw instant attention characters, expressions situations. Django Unchained, then, becomes fun primarily characters cast essays them. Jamie Foxx Django superb. Watch character gradually change confused slave confident free man, gets used idea longer bonded. Tarantino seems made habit writing Christoph Waltz Academy Award-winning roles, good reason. He expectedly excellent articulate immaculate German former-dentist, Dr. Schultz. Samuel Jackson Leonardo DiCaprio largely ignored awards season year, I fail understand why. Separated skin colour one less devious other, characters bring new spin ‘negative’, two perform immensely well. They were, me, pick cast. What separates Tarantino filmmakers isn’t fact fine screenwriter well director. Each facets cinematic craft distinct voice, explains confidently puts completed scripts films online well released scripts invariably make great reads without later ruining experience watching film; films, all, exist entirely different universe altogether - elevated movie universe rules. And therein lies big concern Django Unchained. Tarantino far made two kinds movies – ‘real’ movies like Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction, exaggerated-universe ones like Kill Bill Inglourious Basterds. One imagine latter two movies exist universe characters former two. Thus, one imagine Larry Dimmick Reservoir Dogs going watch WWII flick called Inglourious Basterds cinemas. Django Unchained, tilting slightly towards latter category, isn’t obvious outright fit there, try explore further. Thus, even though I maintain Django Unchained mostly delight, compared sheer audacity earlier filmography, ‘de’ often silent.
