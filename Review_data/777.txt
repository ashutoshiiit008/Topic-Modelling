Despite borderline cheesy trailer, Revolver Rani - name, supposedly women-centric theme post-Queen Kangna Ranaut make believe film potential winner. Interestingly enough cheesiness trailer actually borderline enjoyable quirkiness; women-centric theme "supposedly" end Kangna Ranaut fantastic job bringing zaniness alive. However, disappointment "woman-centric" bit story plays takes away everything could appreciable film. Despite spoofiness goofiness all, I couldn't believe panning her, Revolver Rani. On hand, Kangna Raut makes every bit crazy Revolver Rani (aka Alka) believable enjoyable. Yes, she's over-the-top good way. Now, that's something I'd say rarely OTT performance. Sure, places loses certainly one performances labor shows. But, I must say Queen I give lady extra points trying. She lose steam scenes. But, unfair blame her. The writing loses steam becomes repetitive often. The second half tries bring sense plot disservice hilarity all. It doesn't help Revolver Rani, none characters get attention writers. They rather plain painfully predictable. The one thing consistent would beautiful paid little attention background score. It asynchronous visuals adds layer eccentricity. Revolver Rani makes feel potential enjoyable, out-of-the-box film. But, I doubt, second half possible redemption.
