Ancestral feud. Mutual hatred. Boy meets girl. And ain't enough, rom-com, song-dance sequences comic relief. Those, know, ingredients masala cocktail. They seem almost right proportion too. How much element allowed marinate things go wrong. So, it’s go right ahead "Salmaniacs", others it's complete loss either. That could masalaparameters kept void, like love triangle, spy tribe, etc. But, really wanted get could been, lot could've straightened make better mark audiences. For example, comic element romantic thread distracted story big time. The sincerity lovers didn't reach us mainly due laughs makers seek generate. Then, there's almost 3-hour length pace every elements story unfolds. While introduction various Rajahs Sardars black, white guess what…some gray characters takes first half, isn't boring. For one way camera moves, pans zooms, make marvel terrain. Then songs, especially Taali, composed, sung, picturized (in smallish tribal den), choreographed draw keep attention. At point wondering story still waiting told see potential too. Welcome second half. While good things first half nowhere seen, plot leads extremely involving conflicts dilemmas. The politics British, Rajputs commoners intriguing. So, don't really miss enjoyable music, there's something keeps hooked. Unfortunately, pace needs told (in hour that's left) challenge. And everything resolved hurry, leaving way many important questions unanswered. And ends disappointing fashion ever! At end, like almost every Salman-starrer. More him, actor, character. He plays cool-dude wearing Pindhari outfits (I've serious doubts costumes researched authentic). His dad played Mithun bit happy, full valor emotional turns. The beautiful-but-plaster-of-Paris look debutant Zarine Khan interesting meat character could potentially hold. Yes, woman epic drama actually valuable role, end collapses humdrum. How I wish, actions explained little better shown brain own. Her dilemma love duty worthy detail. Because time theater spent smiling waiting interesting things happen, kept interested. But out, I think element story caught fancy, I realized wasn't developed further. They didn't take conclusion, logical otherwise. I'd still trash it; it's fair attempt entertain, manages intermittently.
