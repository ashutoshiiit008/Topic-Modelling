Watching Mithya like watching cricket match started well ended one-sided all. Anything happen lunch break. But second innings, fight, struggle keep attention thus end cold climax. And cold-blooded murders don't anything cold. It like "I couldn't care less" cold. The subtle comedy first half integral part plot - comment "anything free better" attitude, hints eating habits people film industry. Barring lone toilet joke, interdependency lines situation brings flow plot. The humor along art direction, background score, performances, etc. create environment conducive suspension disbelief. And disbelief live with. Only see movie rushed one episode keeping 120 minute time-limit mind. Genre shifts mixing many genres generally bother me. But, finger cannot pointed towards either. It moves dark comedy plain dark. That's much shift. But disconcerting see humor dry along way. I would blame writing downfall - dialogues witty funny more, sub-plots well streamlined. And lacked punch, mind-bending twist movie genre needs. Giving credit it's due though, likes Rajat Kapoor could cast Ranveer Shorey main lead. It takes guts Naseeruddin Shah play second fiddle. And certainly made attempt show many layers VK/Raj's (Ranveer Shorey) character. Now, whether successful getting across audience altogether different issue. An awesome opportunity portray VK's mental process lost. The first half-second half split writing taken toll performances too. A promising start everybody bit getting cackle comic timing. And suddenly, acting becomes superficial movie approaches climax. On hand, I thoroughly enjoyed background score throughout movie. At times however, especially beginning, overpowered volume dialogues thus I might missed good dialogues. But overall, refreshing accompaniment. A second half flowed better would made Mithya must watch tongue-in-cheek humor. The anti-climatic climax leaves feeling high dry. All hoopla what? The common way get oft-repeated noir climax?
