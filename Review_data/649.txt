Anyone stays metropolis reasonably social know people remind eight characters movie. But yet, neither identify feel good about/bad them. Conclusion - characters reasonably well sketched narrative doesn't engage you. Since characters regular people aren't really expecting never-imagined-before story. Four couples - four different types love stories. Fair enough. Presumably one represents type metropolitan relationship. But, story regular people really make interesting movie? True, crave realism. But, insightful, leave mark thought process. If laughs want, you'll get those, I don't think makers mind. They intended make something meaningful lighter vein, light vein left with. And lot inconsistencies. The funny lines make laugh, thought "out loud". And supposedly funny situations don't even that. The "boss" character entirely avoidable. Introspective and/or emotional moments turn lectures imparted/listened point real life. And likely, used much better language. The writer given due credit inventing new swear word though. The actors deliver lines aren't best job either. The best lot, Manjari, average talent. Amruta loud times, Neelam shouldn't given dialogues - certainly English monologues. (Neelam's screen name Xenobia every time came screen word "Xenophobia" kept popping head.) Anyway, none actors screen presence make work. The music could little appealing different tunes different songs. Since almost sounded same, time listen third song, reached expiry date tune. The presentation best random. No sizzling dances sweep feet. Lyrics Sameer. Do I really need say weren't interesting either? What interesting though camerawork one scenes. So, movie relationships, proposals break-ups. Amidst ordinary camerawork, one break-up, camera crew getting creative you. They take handheld camera shots used thrillers, thrilling background music et al. Technically, entire scene looked completely out-of-place. Oh well. Mediocrity, thy name Mumbai Salsa. Stories lives may seem interesting us, unfortunately make watchable movies. So much realism!
