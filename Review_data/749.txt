Ragini MMS old spooky Hindi, supernatural film. In fact, first half hour film like watching sleazy, slow B-grade film crass language attempt overt "sexual" scenes. The thing stands film apart rest films fall bracket awesome performances. The one thing completely cheeses "horror" films real story. They titillate repititive. They don't really need set even hate character don't want bad things happen him. If he's bad want punishment control maybe mean grumpy, old ghost. That's film succeeds. Uday Jhalla lousy, cheesy, creepy character want get away spirit. Raj Kumar Yadav squeezes every bit aversion later pity you. Kainaz Motivala evokes sympathy naivet√© helplessness. Despite bleh first half, spook-inducing decisions made second half freaking awesome. The kind even 95 minutes seem long. In duration it's Ragini MMS bad film want claustrophobia go away. The director done something right every time spirit speaks, skin crawls. (Or could kept reminding Nandita Das' performance Chitra Palekar's Marathi film, maati maay"?) You horror film lover enjoy one. Nope, real titillation terms sexual scenes indicated promos. Oh yeah, standard horror-film disclaimer. Basically, I can't handle them.
