'It's ok gay', 'Imperfections make people real', 'Laughing loosens up', 'Loosening utmost importance live life king-size', 'A life shouldn't lived without love' - tacky lines yet noble thoughts. But given additional coat honey misty eyes, etc become cheesy digest. Because sloppy lines pertinent, contemporary, important subject hand seems like joke. There attempt avoiding clich√©s. Sure gays butt jokes elements used slapsticky. I understand subject needs treated lightly approachable. But, attempt make gay look normal done without sensitivity gay guy's pathos. It brilliant concept try project homophobia without embarrassing homosexuals stereotyping them. It also awesome idea consider might happen homophobic suspects gay, good grief! For sadly us, audience too. And entire hullabaloo end? Never mind process getting absolutely irrational, hardly relatable, suspiciously real. Also flow process one event leading another. Characters either flat transform easily. Some gags seem really forced in, example, feels like character given particular name specific pun used. It sickening I couldn't feel anything character played Vinay Pathak. After movies like Bheja Fry Dasvidaniya Vinay Pathak lead sort-of begin trust choice scripts know least going different. And different, Straight is. Only different unfortunately doesn't always translate good case even average. How out-of-the-ordinary script much injustice Vinay Pathak every time comes screen, hurts? An equally pertinent question would Gul Panag spent energies ping-pong ball type role. Yes, yes, explanation coming through. Remember, woman Hindi cinema 80s-90s? How would tossed around Hero number 1 Hero number 2 parent villain back Hero number 1? How intelligent actor like Gul equally intelligent character Renu herself? I can't stop shaking head despair I wouldn't even know begin describing dejection entire sound design visuals. Suddenly, make feel like cartoon film. I admit I liked first time car London transitioned tempo-truck Indian road. But then, technique repeated often loud whoosh likable further. There way many coincidences story asked make way many assumptions film work. It's important sexual orientation become common talk lives movies way begin. But shoddily done films aren't going cut deal. And thus another half-decent plot goes zig-zag straight vain.
