Chintoo feels like film made team really wanted make film kids show adults child's point view. Therein lies contradiction. If film kids bother showing point view adults? If point show child's perspective adults, movie needed made adults kids only. Chintoo doesn't enough material rather childish considered film adults. Yet, work kids capture way looking things around imagination. Though must watch even kids, it's like kids much choice summer. Chintoo full moments worthy spending time executed well. But, come together one complete story. The build-up team called 'waanar vede warriors', acknowledgement need fitness, struggle putting together stadium, aspirations, struggle opposing bunch children, finally battle adult can't see way - among many things Chintoo wants talk about. In middle see various interconnections - parents struggle today's age couch-gaming, parents-as-a-unit relationship child, mother-son tie, bonding grandparent child. Unfortunately, different things stay different don't link form one smooth-flowing story. What makes Chintoo worthwhile (at least kids) sections treated lot love care. For little bit section engages look forward going end with. That doesn't end anything substantial, meaningful interesting different thing together. In sense, Chintoo might aimed attention span 10-year olds. As adult, started perfect look familial interactions parents children ended overdose whining I left behind home peace quiet theater. Yet, let speak behalf Chintoo comics reason nostalgia. I didn't grow wouldn't know means someone has. On hand, I'd assume film directed equally towards people hadn't read comics. So, part audience I know I many problems Chintoo panned out. From already said innumerable questions climax many inconsistencies writing throughout, Chintoo far 'must watch' experience. Sure, kids acted well nothing exceptional performances. The adults looked sounded like caricatures except Vibhavari Deshpande. But much make-up extremely distracting. That Subodh Bhave's wig/hair-do. So distracting I choose mention mentioning apt amount cuteness child artists have. Just typical right amount is. Just lack choice kids summer, Chintoo might film worth watch kids. For adults, survive another week theaters, can't we?
