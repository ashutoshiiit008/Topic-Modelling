A lady tells don, "I city, can't me." It bothered Once Upon A Time Mumbaai bothers Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara - exactly one city like Mumbai? One wants - I try imagine magnanimosity aspirations. But one claims everyone around goes almost three hours owns it, begin really wonder works out? How one city like Mumbai, let alone twice? Once I got it, I warmed Once Upon Ay Time Mumbai Dobaara's style drama, teeny-weeny bit. Not enough sure, complete washout either. The thing move relies heavily "powerful" dialogue is, might indeed find four five dialogues invoke kind emotion you. Either romance skepticism sarcasm attempt profound, might lines Once Upon Ay Time Mumbai Dobaara might remember. Only sift tons lines including delivered enthusiasm even smallest character artists. Whether like it, appreciate dialogue writer's conviction make every single line powerful. In fact, many situations characters seem like created accommodate dialogue. Fortunately, situations characters exist build themes love, hatred loyalty. Of three theme loyalty worked upon works best. The romance rather lame hatred purely functional. Given huge conflict loyalty love, route Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara chooses resolve conflict, film could've lot impact. Despite predictability, lot human element could've explored. But style priority content stylish dialogue delivery actual acting, limitations pre-defined. Even so, though performances don't get involved characters, every while, forget actor playing it. You loathe Shohaib audacity bit forget it's Akshay Kumar screen. This actually big deal considering last films done. Imran Khan manages invoke kind sympathy towards Aslam, even momentarily. Sonakshi Sinha helps Jasmine hold man owns Mumbai Dobaara worth, give Akshay Kumar tough fight screen presence. Unfortunately, romance zero chemistry. There chemistry Akshay Kumar Sonali Bendre Sophie Choudry little time given Sonakshi Sinha either men. Yet, fault doesn't lie performances, writing choice situations depict romance lack oomph, despite superfluous style. So, laden heavy dialogue attempted one all, heavy voice, Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara isn't random first episode, yet doesn't suck despite potential so.
