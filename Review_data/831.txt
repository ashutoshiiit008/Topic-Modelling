I tears, boredom. It hurts find film disgusting enough gets nerves. It mindless slapstick quality humor, lack anything - complete absence thought put creating half-decent product. Especially, enough potential given middle-aged Parsi couple. Also, couple interesting dilemmas play with. But none taken seriously fact, left unaddressed. All then, shake head despair. Usually 'How anyone..." question pretty vain. The obvious answer – "well, like did..." But Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi makes difficult control asking series questions. How could Sanjay Leela Bhansali write incoherent story? How could every one involved film see tedious getting? How could make film less two hours feel long? How could anyone think Farah Khan could act?! The lady talks like judge one reality shows. Same tone, expression, plain flat. Any attempt changing expressions seem forced affected. Shirin Farhad... almost felt like make true Farah Khan's childhood wish playing lead school play, wasn't allowed part of. Her way telling world, "because I it!" Fortunately, off-timing use lame, predictable lines excuse. But, almost departments contribute equal measure sinking ship. The songs win race taking faster. The point story tries get lacks power – us make issue little things instead focusing big picture. The narrative lackluster audience couldn't bothered wit h it. Sure, Boman Irani tries best save film lot grace. But, want give bear hug film. He must reasons, many directors/writers going go lead anchor film, despite capabilities? And Bhansali brother-sister duo need applauded. It takes guts non-standard characters leads, especially debut film. But, points need taken Boman Irani participate one. Also, rest story soporific induces yawns snores laughs. Except one two 'funny lines' trailers, there's barely anything even induce smile. And think, "yay! Just five minutes go!", get "Did think can't make worse?" climax. A supposedly 'cute' romantic comedy zero chemistry lead actors many moments want make bang head closest wall rather laugh – Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi about.
