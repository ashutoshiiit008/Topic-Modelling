After watching 2 brilliant films back-to-back,Tere Bin Laden Udaan, I set hatrick. But Sanjay Dutt's slo-mo entry loud background music showed expectations place. But heart still hung hope Rahul Dholakia surely make strong commentary. And commentary was. Lamhaa revision Kashmir's saga 1989 running description nothing changed since then. Itâ€™s boring doesn't get involved except last reel so, atrocities jihaadis effectively slapped face. It arguably insurmountable task film address nexus one fascist faction, another faction, Indian government, Pakistani Government, idealists, military, common man - aspirations, filled back-stabbers double-crossers. I'd assume understandable film rush without much attention details - characterization, plot pace. But accompanied notion typical, shrill music background dramatization techniques reserved infant-amateurs. And like drawing one straw, last one. The last one would predictable dialogues. It disheartening see actor actor repeat thing words - "No one cares Kashmir real issues, everyone agenda masked altruism." What starts history lesson, ends attempt brainwash us repetitive mention current state affairs. Within this, name 'Strong' derivatives used many times get desensitized beauty terror 2 syllables. (Geeky joke warning: Someone seems briefed writer google ranks videos according number times word repeated content!) So line dialogues exist filler, silent frame penalized, choppy screenplay. The performances aren't ordinary, extraordinarily bad. Anupam Kher, course, comes really well inspirational leader. Kunal Kapoor less flat principled leader masses. Bipasha's emotional outbursts involving. But neither brings glamor quotient fit role someone grown conservative environment. She's straight gait city-girl like entirely convincing. You could've taken stride story evolves second half came little earlier. In attempt start macro narrow slowly one event, writers lost track time. From characters represent entities plot gravitates towards individual A&Os. This focus people belong group intriguing, it's little, late. It remarkable vanity issue global repercussions comes across, despite flaws. By end, heart goes Kashmiris touched. And that, Lamhaa's true success.
