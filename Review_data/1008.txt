This country first attack arthritis symbolizes aging. We dismissed mom's menopause random irritability. Making big deal 'turning 30' considered, best, much ado nothing. That make problems facing chic-urban-turning-30 less important. Yes, all, want more. And proudly so; even fight it. In sense Turning 30!!! could important film. But turns drab narrative. You wait spark kept waiting. I consider part target audience, I'm city-bred, I turned 30 little ago. I might chic her, I friend two like women Turning 30!!! talks about. Yet Naina (Gul Panag) friends don't even remotely touch me. I'd wanted smile jokes, nod insights love, life everything goes it. I'd loved cry too, I cringed first couple times I saw Gul cry. There's much grown-up woman see crying, all. The much talked about, rightly so, Sex The City hangover dreary superficially profound original (go ahead, shoot killing stereotype women liking SATC!) And yet, wouldn't bore weren't repetitive. Fortunately, writer/director open showing woman's sexual urges. Hindi films all, always shy express sensuality. That lust goes hand-in-hand desperate love gets slice-of-life woman love - age bar. I also liked hand homosexuality dealt. Right close friends initially react lesbian friend coming larger group reacts everyone comes terms it. Naina's struggle work something kept going. It felt like writer insight woman's aspirations work; frustrations macho men industry; struggle getting rightfully hers. But, goes bust sorrily written climax. That's story film's life. There many things going right, sooner later, go flat. Like woman who's 60s likely say, celebrating whining 30th thing-to-do women know nothing real suffering pain hands men. And pain physical versus 'literal pain ass ex-boyfriend was', Naina heard complaining about. But, that's 60-year old say. We 30-Pluses chance blew it.
