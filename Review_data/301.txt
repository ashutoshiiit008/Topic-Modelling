There's serial killer loose kills women ruthlessly yet I smiling things happening screen mildly amusing hardly scary. With hero hardly care for, lead lady carved sweet true villain hardly menacing strain him, Ek Villain revenge saga works hard trying make feel characters fails left gaping screen bewilderment two hours. The main culprit much backstory. Too much backstory lead characters much backstory villain. Serial killers serial killers serial killers. They don't really need reason so. I know I always fan grey characters, one doesn't work here. His reasons convincing, thus end distraction "villainy". I intrigued movie started looked like climax. It difficult pull thriller audience knows lot happens. And difficult stays, Ek Villain. There little effort put making dynamics situation reached stage particular climax interesting. While movie starts bang lot happens story-wise too, reaches lull soon enough. It left actors keep things going. Of lot, Siddharth Malhotra limited range expressions came across closest natural. Both Shraddha Kapoor Riteish Deshmukh trying hard chirpy villainous respectively, effective. You could say tried bit well, terms trying perform. But cute turned shrill annoying villainous actually made laugh once. Yet, I glad Riteish Deshmukh tried something different slapstick. Here's attempts. The film also loud, general, almost one character shouting guise full life full anger. It doesn't help characters voicing thought instead showing action. We know lot villain's characters description others, monologue. I don't even want get logical gaps film. These clearly things makers wanted take audience granted about. Most quick fixes get one situation another. There slight sliver story might worked energies spent making story non-linear. The story enough meat, even without backstories, make decent film. But, doesn't work combination performances, side-tracks story takes, songs dances. Quirks like Kamaal R Khan's character irritating anything else, though mean played well. Yet, doesn't make inclusion advantage film. Saying story potential giving little credit deserves lot needed edited rather changed. We'll continue wait good thriller come way.
