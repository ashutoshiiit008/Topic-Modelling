Do remember days younger, went crazy something other? Trading cards, dolls, cricketer, film star, fellow classmate? Through Kshay, Chhai's (Rasika Dugal) obsession Goddess Laxmi made think obsessed child. One would claim, "you don't understand!" anyone tried talk mania thought perfectly valid. And slowly see adults know Chhai's eyes. Their obsession might different money, power fame - similarity stark. And realize counter-productive shallow, don't give up. Kshay story symbolizes exactly that. The parallel doesn't stop there. The irony, please Goddess Laxmi, goddess wealth - even though she's asking - requires money, never leaves you. Also, Kshay's fixation people fixated one thing none else shown black white palate, like color exists them, like life shades. Though cannot said charactes. Chhai, husband Arvind, neighbor Shruti - varying shades gray. They real, reach you, worry however tiny role be. The villain surely stark black, representing concretized brutality business world, construction business. Arvind hand perfect example guy chasing dream, one looks tired chasing he's willing accept compromise, someone making offer. Yet, dots script seem like don't connect I indeed perplexing. But, allow accept Chhai's fanaticism, realize world connection makes perfect sense. Or greater still, world requires connection. But, even visibly mentally disturbed, supposed resemble us obsession. Therein lies biggish problem Kshay. It Kshay disengage first minutes non-standard thus absurd sounds overt attempt abstract. It niggling feeling I films fall realm, go extra length make audience figure point film. I'm saying spoon-feed us, go way make simple objective look something intellectual ultimately is. Isn't gray black white? The good news though I accept route Kshay taken, engaging film. A film certainly lauded indie project saw light four years effort group debutantes.
