What job person who's writing opinion film? To let know I liked why. Sure. But Raavan made want warn you. Warn though exhilarating experience, one might expected be, trick could use enjoy film. Don't think drama, engaging take one serious issue other. Think decently-made musical. An opera. Almost everything film poetic. Barring places, cinematography background music fabulous. There couple scenes camera goes round round character sole purpose making audience's head spin. Other though, sense fog, dew, breeze around characters. The mist adds lyrical photography. Similarly, save spots, background music extremely different covers HUGE range music. My understanding music pretty basic, I loved use folk/tribal music. Also, using different types music different characters situations noticeable rather lovely. How I wish could get complete OSTs films. But like love can't finance materialistic needs, technically beautiful film contribute much making film "good". The culprits pace narrative style film. The key word previous statement 'style'. In attempt make tough terrain visually suave, Mani Ratnam forgot K-I-S-S principle. The montage film starts truly breathtaking. Without saying word, situations characters established. But, doesn't remain smart throughout. In fact, huge slack-off period climax-with-great-potential. The dilemma wonderfully created statement film trying make, "In every Ram there's Raavan vice versa." All sudden late. Nothing made it. Also, wasn't time left delve details. ow one cause one effect, I know. All I know I saddened see super-gray characters killed hollow writing. Given decision make film close theatrical performance (hopefully intentional), cast section titled over-actors. Govinda brings occasional smile. I never thought prettiest human, nature must created, Aishwarya Rai, good actor. But Abhishek Bachchan films always attracted towards them. This film made reconsider actor. It uber-annoying see stylishly walk like walked Bluffmaster. And despite above, times made think. Especially compared ages-old epic. It occurred agni pariksha insult Sita's honor also offensive Raavan's virtuousness. And Laxman cut Surpankha's nose, metaphor conditioned ignore? Oh, blasphemy! While it's pretty neat film give things ponder also gives bonus agony wait even longer film I highly recommend. sigh
