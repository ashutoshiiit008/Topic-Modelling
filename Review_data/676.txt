There's something mark Darren Aronofsky's Noah. You can't quite place finger it, particularly you're watching film, spectacular imagery intense themes. Even you're done, film stays you, making wonder why, despite liking film largely, something still feels amiss. But that, honestly, later. It cinema - good, great average - always strive do. Make question hours you've watched it. Aronofsky's magnum opus precisely that, even doesn't sweep feet completely. The Biblical tale Noah, ark built help creation life survive massive floods aimed cleansing world, well known. Noah character apparently fascinated Aronofsky much he's always wanted make film him. Noah, film, mounted larger anything Aronofsky made before. Also, big departure him, time around tackles theological spiritual aspects directly, instead layering beneath complex characters, way always done far. The effect film mixed bag. Visually, film undeniably striking. Remember, film set time period equated infancy planet Earth. The world itself, then, looks pristine fresh. The skies hue blue hardly ever see today, soil rocks look almost alien. Some breathtaking frames interesting time-lapse stop motion sequences make Noah film whose images won't exit mind's eye hurry. There also beautifully designed CGI creatures, particularly bunch made stone; faces look like rough rocks, actually evoke emotion. On flip side, even though themes film - corruption humankind, merciless manner treat species share planet with, justice, guilt - universal, fact tale set particular time. The visuals impactful, characters stories seem distinctly - want better word - 'modern'. Nicholas Winding Refn's Valhalla Rising, instance, (even though absolutely similarity Noah terms story setting,) similar visual feel it. The desolation, come far Noah, set millennia earlier Valhalla Rising, nearly convincing former latter. Also, fantasy element film treated mix edgy bravado cautious trepidation. Almost Aronofsky wasn't sure cater adult audience children. Nevertheless, VFX film outstanding most. Russell Crowe plays Noah fiery intent. His physical graph film, well sheer intensity eyes, traverse journey requires truly committed actor, Crowe shines. The rest cast, though competent, don't really much do. Darren Aronofsky's latest, thus, can't distilled bad, good great. Even shortcomings, rises much usually see big screen days. Yet, leave lingering feeling; something epic story seems little off.
