Movie ticket: Rs. 150 Coffee + water: Rs. 60 Guy front banging head despair: PRICELESS It's nice know company sentiment towards movie, right? I've never fancied horror much. But watching 13B I wondering I dislike - squirms movie done well annoying 'typical' camerawork background score make unintentionally funny. Some standard techniques face obviously annoying. That movie took turn better latter half didn't help much, enthusiasm watching movie worn off. And since TV haunting making accurate forecasts, end seeing everything twice - TV prediction movie. And sometimes makers feel obliged repeat dialogue two even first repetition. And that, TV spoon-feeding us case missed point real life replicating reel life. Not mention appliances taking life bit rubbed till begin tearing hair apart. And lack creativity trying horrify us? When last time violins rising crescendo didn't bring snickers eye-rolls? I craving normal, straight, non-close-up shot. Some bits slow director without doubt knew audience would know happen. Then, would that? And I one bothered 'the unknown entity' obsessed house address without rhyme reason? Madhavan though good job portraying Manohar's anger, frustration, vulnerability. The rest cast ok. A potentially scary concept completely messed up. But, imagine this. All soap operas television - real life starts replicating them. Or believe lives replicating become self-fulfilling prophecies. Now, that's I call horror!
