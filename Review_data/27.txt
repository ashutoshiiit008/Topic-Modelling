I spooked easily maybe I fond horror films. So, difficult understand "liking" horror film would feel like "good" horror film is. In mind then, I translate feeling horror film good manages spook normal me. With disclaimer disposal, 3 AM decent horror film till loses steam last half hour, is. Its time another disclaimer. When I say I get spooked easily, doesn't mean regular Hindi horror film actually comedy masquerading around horror film. It characters get involved enough care them; I don't want ghost spirit trouble them. And bit 3 AM manages reasonably well building chemistry Sunny (Rannvijay Singh) Sara (Anindita Nayar) camaraderie Sunny friends Cyrus (Salil Acharya) Raj (Kavin Dave). Of course, first get past major loopholes character development like would Sunny get Sara even Cyrus Raj dangerous situations without backup. But, willing accept move on, chilling moments eerily long, uncomfortable sequences dark. The kind lingering sequences make want dawn 3AM characters break dance number middle haunted building. The exact kind thing I would scoff at, happen. And happen, relief. Except relief stays long tension fails build back level. The rest story pretty much average horror film story. Haunted building, evil spirit, innocent killed, search truth survivors, impending disaster. The thing keep going way spookiness executed. It boils sound, light performances. Editing monochrome handycam recording general dark environment gives 3 AM's horror bits good eerie backdrop. Add on, minimal use background music heavy reliance sounds set chill right level. The mere absence typical Hindi horror films violins creaks good enough make horror film reasonably scary. The performances aren't half bad either. The characters make usual horrified faces scream display pain appropriately. None distracting. Rannvijay Singh, Salil Acharya Kavin Dave give engaging performances horror scenes. The rest film though, look little affected. Anindita Nayar regular horror expression-less, supposed x-factor lead lady film. She doesn't big role isn't required emote much. 3 AM, thus, ingredients needed execute average horror product. Where fails keeping momentum end. Even lost enthusiasm climax, could've overlooked. But, energy drops good half hour end, became intense makers themselves. Even though 3 AM leaves room sequel interesting premise, one little bit anti-climax, little bit cop-out, lot mood-dampner. So what, I complaining?
