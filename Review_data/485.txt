Story - brilliant, colors - vibrant, camerawork - creative, sound - unobtrusive, editing - slick, entire team - smart! Sorry, director saahab, I run adjectives, choose superlative I’ll agree. What I say? Where I start? I must admit, difficult write suspense thriller “without giving movie away”. Any specifics I would like talk contribute knowing bit movie. And would crime genre. So, attempt unambiguous possible. This movie talked lot stylish homage director pays people/styles movie-making inspired him. And good reason too. The beauty tributes interwoven narrative something one write read about. It watched applauded. Watch way subtle tribute Anand blended become part story. Acting - one departments missing list - best. Dharmendra deserved far fewer lines considering dialogue delivery rather monotonous. Neil Nitin Mukesh quite flat scenes, overall, grasped enacted nuances character really well. For me, Vinay Pathak show stealer. In general, versatility actor incredible! Dialogues - disappointment area might expectations set first 15-20 minutes movie. The general mysterious tone set beginning missing certain points later on. Especially, climax, keeping dialogue enigmatic would much impact. But, I sure balance director must struggled - leave audience decipher spoon-feed them. What impressed much I enjoyed movie despite little dissatisfied two main departments movie - two visible ones. Though acting dialogues necessarily selling points movie genre. Just goes show long way treatment material take movie.
