A host good-for-nothings trying make quick money pay yelling landlady breathing necks. Heard one before? They strike brilliant idea objectifying fairer sex start turning peeping Toms. But, woman won’t do. Not particular lady perfect vital statistics, also rich heir. Please note, possibility rich merit. Mind you, though one woman put together. And course exaggeration plays equally male stereotype too. Poor things shown even insensitive average man, imagine that! Oh never mind, let’s move I get feminist you. Oh come on, cannot blaming giving story away; seen bit – many times. And anyway, giving credit due, little movie foursome wooing lady. So what, little might well made different movie altogether. Now, name Priyadarshan come mind? Also creditworthy funny dialogues slickly put regular lines. So, attentive get jokes. But that’s smartness ends. It pretty much doesn’t matter character says lines characters don’t individualistic characteristics. And pretty much doesn’t matter story dialogues scripted, could equally randomly interspersed anywhere rest story (ies). I think time I stop complaining wasted Om Puri, Sherman Joshi, Rajpal Yadav loud characters wooden Kunal Khemu, Tusshar Kapoor, Tanushree Dutta loud characters loud Asrani Tiku Talsania loud characters. In future I try point things actors different. Music? Lyrics? Don’t remember it. So, let’s say forgettable. So, except funny lines teeny-weeny bit curiosity aroused second story, isn’t much going movie. But, again, weren’t expecting anything different crew, we?
