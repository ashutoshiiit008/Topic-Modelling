The DVD Amelia, bit surprise. Despite featuring award winning starcast, acclaimed director (Monsoon Wedding, The Namesake) biopic historical figure - category that’s soft spot critics - film blurbs front back cover. Not single one. No stars, ratings recommendations film reviewers. At first, I thought layout faux pas - maybe forgot add those. To sure, I remembered something amiss film released theatrically India. There hardly buzz media, celebratory coverage considering Mira Nair helmed big Hollywood project. There’s two-time Oscar winning actress Hillary Swank title role Amelia Earheart, Richard Gere plays George Putnam, manager husband, Ewan McGregor Gene Vidal, lover. But consensus amongst reviewers audiences common - film could much better. After seen film DVD, I think opinion isn’t entirely wrong. But considering amount trash Hollywood throws screen time, I think Amelia, still fairly watchable. The screenwriters must obviously come across much literature already exists - three books credited adaptation - first woman pilot fly solo across Atlantic, disappeared somewhere Pacific ocean trip attempting circumnavigate world. It’s dilemma even writers Harry Potter franchise face every film: How pack two-hour film? But Earheart’s biopic spell-binding special effects bonanza. Sure, spectacular aerial shots plane crossing continents - fondly recollecting journey life. It touches skeleton Amelia Earheart, hardly managing get soul depict head-strong woman able convince male-dominated society determination fly. Solo. This film makes appear task must difficult, given Putnam’s (Gere) support. He master strategist, publisher always seems cracking deals, using name, appearance knowledge wonderfully create intellectual property, resulting wealth two them. There rarely scene makes go ‘Wow, woman was!’, truth indeed woman who’s achievements characters make Americans go ‘Wow’. Gene Vidal (McGregor) role rather forgettable - mouths 7-8 lines film one would wanted see much him. Gere (Putnam) plays loyal husband well, little chemistry Amelia. Before get married, romance seems rushed although Putnam devoted, one clear whether marriage convenience since realises hen lays golden eggs, genuinely fallen love her. Hillary Swank puts sincere effort Kansas twang, coupled make-up give authenticity weight real persona Earheart. Much like aeroplanes flies film, glides role ease. The character sought after, performance isn’t. Despite shortcomings, I feel sense pride Mira Nair’s film. I’d put little fault - writing lets down. The film high points, climax one them. It’s gripping, tense extremely well put together. I think must pressure deciding parts keep parts edit, since final output film projects Earheart non-offensive nature. The kind wouldn’t want upset succeeding generations lead protagonists. You become sure see deleted scenes DVD extras. It throws light Amelia’s love life met Putnam. It also introduces us character mercilessly chopped final cut - Putnam’s first wife. All scenes removed film. I must also point DVD extras noted cover bit lie. The disc inside doesn’t Making Amelia, The Power Amelia Earheart, Movietone News Trailers. Now, that’s cheating, last thing one needs seeing disappointing film.
