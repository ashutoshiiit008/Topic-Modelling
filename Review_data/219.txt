It's kind tiring ALL characters film U-turnaround. Of course, there's barely anything cannot predict rom-com. But something chemistry, "lines", situations look forward to. Crazy Stupid Love little bit o-kay bit that, none satisfying enough make recommend film you, even it's playing TV. You regular cool, suave Jacob (Ryan Gosling) knows objectify women get anyway. He obviously, guides simple, clueless-around-women-because-he-respects-them Cal (Steve Carell) finding "manhood". That stage set, women flit screen per convenience. But, actors play women, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone even Analeigh Tipton strong make presence felt, however short screen time may be. In comparison, two men Ryan Josling Steve Carelljust look like going drill looking HOT confused respectively. What broke heart Marisa Tomei's performance. Where lady blows mind away every time I watch My Cousin Vinny? In Crazy Stupid Love, over-acting rather melodramatic. :( In fact, lot things film melodramatic - slo-mo Jacob, repeat-for-effect Steve Carell; people audience/on street clapping protagonists good reason, climax. All effectively cringe-worthy. In middle though funny scenes trailer cozy, romantic moments. Are enough pull though? Would have/could have, better climax. The one twist film pretty cool, falls flat "whatevaa" feeling film gives ends. And me, till I alright side-stories film laced with, interesting. But, led nowhere. And shock-value situations dialogues thrown in. They make smile, purpose catch off-guard transparent. You soon realize, weren't necessary core plot move forward. I'm realistic here. Yes, I see irony. Realistic rom-com! Anyway, I'm realistic I didn't expect swept floor. But, I thought I'd fun. For parts, I didn't.
