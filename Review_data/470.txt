A movie starts goes on. Not terms sluggish pace, it's playing watching - indifferent uninvolved. It movies like try stylize Kunal Khemu Fardeen Khan make appreciate charisma Shah Rukh Khan Salman Khan. At least screen presence makes worthy slo-mo entries they've awarded years. Kunal Khemu oomph factor whatsoever; he's asked "star" like mannerisms incomprehensible. Not mention annoying voice dialogue delivery style. Reminds shrieky, eye-candy women regular Hindi slapstick films. And Fardeen Khan tiny-mouth-pout nose flare capable of, emote anger love. It's like isn't room variation concept emotions run skin-deep. The story great shakes, in, large things predictable. But, every couple lines tiny twist take away little bit absolutely thoughtless genre films. And left taken inch deeper. Like movie style, songs appear 'just because...' But gets annoying ridiculous set designs wannabe 'stylish' type camerawork songs. Also voices used actors different voices distract even viewing experience. Though one visual Dia Mirza wearing bright red orange flowing skirt swaying around radiant-blue sea water. Whether dress losing color water colors mixed intentionally doesn't matter. It beautiful. Anyway, yet another absolutely skippable movie. But, happen see snippets, hold bit.
