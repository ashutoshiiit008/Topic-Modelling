Yes, yet another movie victimized protagonist succumbing pressure “system”. But one dealt touch humor, dark times, funny nevertheless. The flow screenplay gripping. The power flow street beggar business world - via traffic signal leader, mafia, politicians – shown great expertise. Madhur Bhandarkar needs applauded choice subject various reasons. We see street beggars everyday. Either choose ignore choose feel good throwing coin two them. Either way, us certainly choose forget 100 odd seconds spend cursing red light. Then would want spend 100 odd minutes watching movie life traffic light? Huge risk! The movie reflects us believe true. The people lights victims, liars too. They actors performing live. All part huge scam - Right child arms young mother almost nude, crazy old man. The director taken challenge making empathize – right gay sex worker loser drug addict. By interval time, settling idea story-less movie, saying “oh, I see, one slice-of-life things”. Then slowly see story emerging smoothly translating compact climax. The ending punch right amount drama much ado. The acting main characters mostly pleasant surprise. Kunal Khemu says lines monotonously annoying manner. You want yell “talk properly, heaven’s sake”. And suddenly realize exactly would say person “I-own-this-place” attitude, happens character plays. And warm towards character. Similary, though Neetu Chandra, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ranvir Shorey (especially introductory scene) small roles play, one line feel character playing. The one thing work though make-up Kunal Khemu Neeta Chandra, looked artificially dark. Due number lives traffic signal nexus touches (at least 50), long list supporting cast. Overall, supporting cast average. While got skin character (Upendra Limaye) others delivered plain dialogues rather unconvincingly (Sudesh Mishra). The dialogues clearly meant either profound dramatic. However, funny lines achieve purpose getting good laugh you. Traffic Signal added list movies deal social issues crude yet sensitive manner. It gives reality slap across face. And shows you, lighter vein, differently poorest rank priorities conventional “right”.
