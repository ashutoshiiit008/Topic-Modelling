A film starts voiceover, however lovely voice say, feels likes cop out. Save couple times, I felt voiceover escape show us characters, instead told them. Almost, reading character wikipedia entry. Finding Fanny warms initial put-off, set routine soon. From flat, ride downward slope. When ride starts film gets second gear I loved enterprising Angie (Deepika Padukone) getting characters join road-trip find Freddie's (Naseeruddin Shah) love Fanny. She one believe decision make wants do. The means end equally quirky. But, peak eccentricity. After point craziness either forced (a la caricatured Vladimir) flat. This shame individually characters uniquely funny. The humor dark plays quite well. Yes, course, one characters caricature, others, yet entertaining engaging. Savio (Arjun Kapoor) normal all, also flattest character - maybe normal. His outburst though comes nowhere. But crazy bunch, brings bit balance along Angie. Angie sweet, composed romantic. At time creative gives whiff made mind, get wants. This why, character's arch seems little there. Given confidence getting away anything, mystery waited long playing mind. Her strong-headed mother-in-law, Rosie (Dimple Kapadia) hand coconut group - hard outside hiding soft inner self, feeling empty deep within. Now see, herein lies biggest flaw film. This thing Rosie empty deep within, something I deduced went film, another character spells out. Again, nowhere. That character Pedro (Pankaj Kapoor). Easily quirkiest all, Pedro shallow openly so. His pervert eye omnipresent film uncomfortable, even though deep know won't causing much harm. It bit shocker makes insightful observation another character then. I'm saying people overtly shallow incapable making deeper inferences. It's remark comes, over-dramatic makes place otherwise non-dramatic film, also comes nowhere. Do see, trend here. The way characters behave towards end uncharacteristic way defined us till then. It almost made feel like end written everything else everything else came means end. For film seemed enjoying journey much mismatch. I characters behaving character, I feel left-out thus uninterested I brought deviation? The consistent character Freddie whose quest center film. His quest finding love. The beauty search it's intention wanting reciprocation. He wants feelings known. Unfortunately, way quest ends bummer then. Yes, Finding Fanny characters story itself. Which characters needed little initial character sketch. A little detail, little backstory. Thankfully, characters brilliant actors play out. I doubt word would describe "sulky" - might one-word brief got director; portrays well consistently sulking. Deepika Padukone plays Angie reason Savio's sulk. She aware affect uses too. There glimpse wonderful actor Love Aaj Kal. Finding Fanny allows show us film makes it. She uses eyes convey all. A complain held character, Rosie, never held actor plays Dimple Kapadia. As gorgeous ever, padded hips notwithstanding, lady stumps every time I see screen well makes forget actor that's playing it. And I could would use exact words describe Naseeruddin Shah's portrayal Freddie. The one stuck over-done Pankaj Kapoor. I sure director's command. But, sticks like sore thumb exaggerated portrayal character's craziness. Sure, he's done well, wouldn't challenge better one underplay zany character fit rest film? A word Goan atmosphere language I close - really worked me. So background music, even loud times. It would indeed nice experiment scenes, especially romantic ones, without music. Another film, maybe. Once something sticks forced. Which said film's summary Angie spells us end. Such clean-cut, sliced diced ending dark humored film like one deserves. Even so, nice change pace scenery typical Hindi film. Always welcome.
