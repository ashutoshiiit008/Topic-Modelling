Delhi Belly picks genre sticks it. It's generation standing say, "Call us pulp dark, crass gross. This - take leave it." He/she could common youth street, sitting beside theater, new age director producer gracing appearance end credits. The three roommates representatives young, urban India trying break shackles binding considered "normal" life. They, along friends, latest breed graduates - necessarily art, science commerce - alternate fields, like media hospitality. And thing happens - shit. They deal it. By hook crook, see way it. They far sophisticated, care damn. In fact, qualms driving nausea. But take care themselves. Recently seen whole lot films genre. Where bunch innocent people (mere bystanders, even) get trouble unawares, destiny somehow puts puzzle 3-5 parallel stories together. Delhi Belly skin within unpretentious. It inhibitions whatsoever, toilet humor, obscenities, violence, vulgarity sex. I loved focus making audience laugh using language. I certainly missed jokes loud laughter, previous line, didnâ€™t' die time. Delhi Belly doesn't try act smart saying, "Try, figure can" Or "keep pace can". Keeps simple (please admire restraint), does. The flip side course, characters don't get much attention. In keeping story simple, characters one-dimensional. The performances though come characters' rescue. They brilliant I didn't think one acting overacting not. In fact, Vijay Raaz gang caricatured seem little out-of-place yet, pass without causing irritation. Well, I guess it's led Vijay Raaz, all. Well, movie nail would've different movie, right? For example, I wish they'd avoided couple extraneous sub-plots. Anyway, way is, there's much going background music, props dialogue becomes bit overwhelming. Delhi Belly makes over-imposing statements, grand messages. (That's change typical Aamir Khan product.) It's one young film. It fun watching favorite people - 600+ filmaniacs show also whistle hoot 8.15 AM. Let's say like every dabangg audience, every Delhi Belly too. And must lucky bunch whose tastes include both. Ps. Oh yeah, I told right? I'd recommend keep parents away one. That liked Delhi Belly, might bit cultural shock them. Which also means conservative taste films, stay away. Confession: I goofed-up. I watched English version. I feeling real deal Hindi. I'll try catch Hindi version update works better.
