The Rey family moves house which, nanny claims, haunted. After burglary put cameras caution find unseen beings house. The entire movie shown shot surveillance cameras, feature I loved. The concept obviously new, gives whole movie really eerie feel. The repetition shots build tension good. But I disappointed number times I led state I thought something intense would happen, turned out...well, intense. This movie intense, requires patience. As compared previous movie, one little less horrifying. But probably expect something happen time. It skeleton predecessor, finishing different. There nothing new surprising though. And every scene doesn't necessarily something mystic happening. That comes right time, effective making jump. Of course, don't understand every bit story either. But general look film needs remain confusion. As explanations, obviously don’t look – it’ll leave disappointed. What I didn’t like that, theatre college kids around, obviously comment hoot wrong times, diluting tension. How expect scared someone says middle bloodcurdling sequence, “Grab pan hit ghost, silly!” I liked way day night scenes places house shown security cameras. Molly Ephraim (Ali) acted really well teenager. The adults fair performances, nothing commendable. I wonder got child plays Hunter crying. For seen first film, might find sequel wee bit mild. But haven’t, sequences keep thinking, sure they’ll keep scared. To get real feel terror, buy DVD watch home. Alone.
