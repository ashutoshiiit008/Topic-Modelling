Despite low, nil negative, expectations Desi Boyz, I latent hope theme "male escorts" explore sexual needs women - topic almost untouched Hindi film industry. Yes, yes, yes, I'm hearty laugh thought even subconscious. The joke even bigger considering choice Akshay Kumar should've killed hidden wishes. Anyway, notwithstanding, I enjoy hearty laughs Desi Boyz gave I concede manages "no brains please" entertainer aims be. Yet, I cannot keep heart breaking complete disregard story lousy attempt conflict. There peak I wonder care what's going happen Nik (John Abraham) Jerry (Akshay Kumar). They fight easily make up, amongst themselves, girlfriends. Events occur "should" occur rather flowing organically one another. Add unnecessary love guru form Anupam Kher banal dialogue scenes connection film whatsoever. If scenes John Abraham show kind male-bonding, seemed completely out-of-place. Given that, really interesting though scenes don't connect other, work make laugh. Omi Vaidya Bharti Achrekar splits little time screen. Their act gave distinct feeling lot many dialogues would've worked better better performances, especially John Abraham. But hey, clear John Abraham's job description film certainly include acting skills. He features Desi Boyz purely worked-out-to-near-perfection body. Deepika Padukone Chitrangadha Singh look usual beautiful selves. I'll mandatory saying isn't anything looking gorgeous required do. So much women's lib theme, I thought of. Yep, I'm still beating let thought cross mind. They dance, fool around. They make laugh little less ought given wise cracks written them. And sure, lot many individual lines could've worked, overall plot nothing engage. The characters rather bland variety "good heart, grudgingly sell souls loved ones". Desi Boyz talks bit friendship, bit love, bit recession, bit what's needed get want. And attempt fun talking this. But everything superfluous plot gets involved sorely missing.
