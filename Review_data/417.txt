8.30 AM. 600-seater theater. Housefull. Ok-ok almost housefull, mandatory use name, right? So, done that, let tell you, I'm kidding. The theater barely 10-15 vacant seats. And 585-590 seats laughing/hooting/whistling/clapping - basically happy theater something half-half-decent screen. Of course, one person thoroughly relishing fact people around completely involved chaos enjoying experience hilt - truly. I'm saying I didn't like film all, I couldn't call film engrossing 100% entertaining. It alright. I laughed really hard times. But, much mind-blowing, insides-rattling joke I due silliness all. I mean else laugh people suffer electronic shock that, moves become dance. The nutty absurdity restricted one-off incidents. While first half introduces characters builds relationships, second half spent rewiring connections. Whose wife whose sister whose daughter whose wife…or something like that. Yeah, comedy errors mistaken identities potential loads laughs. Housefull neither devoid them, nor…well, full them. Of course, it's standard loud, almost tolerable variety over-the-top defies logic every chance it's given. Out-of-job characters characters presumably low-paying jobs spend money like Midas. Other characters supposedly rich, make wonder low-IQ people could get far. Oops, look getting caught trivialities. The idea fun, well complete loss count. Had performances little subtle little consistent, could easily fun ride run time. But, usual, dialogues consistent roll, events rather sporadic. Similarly, comic timing actors brilliant, individual scenes necessarily strong enough. The three men usual thing. National award winner Arjun Rampal, bit role, looks uncomfortable trying shot comedy. The women hand look good, alternate shrieking sort-of superficially expressing sad/romantic emotion. I love way Deepika Padukone carries skimpiest clothes. Yep! There's loads loads that. And going Jiah Khan, well, bother not. She barely cameo. I know it's famine big-profile releases. I know want rush theater given slightest excuse. But though mindless, silly laughs, I don't heart recommend spend money time takes family go theaters. Time spent it's TV/DVD though might well worth it.
