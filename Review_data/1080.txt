Why remakes made, again? I'd think it's makers felt great value addition thought could make original badly needed. Other fact, course, didn't anything original make. But, I refuse believe makers remake Zanjeer didn't know taking away already not-so-great film. Are smug realise two-expression Ram Charan taking place Amitabh Bachchan many huge steps behind start with? Are blind see disservice films 70s over-bearingly peppy, supposedly dumb Mala (Priyanka Chopra) replace simple sensitive Mala (Jaya Bachchan)? The original nice combination angst sensitivity Vijay Mala. It wasn't explored well too, completely ignored. This takes away huge chunk meat plot had. I guess positive contribution Zanjeer woman gets invited birthday party! You see, Mala left Sher Khan's birthday party 1973. Come 2013, gets look pretty white shake leg too! Priyanka Chopra, like I mentioned earlier, plays perky Mala. We can't really fault script used like comic relief. That besides, Ram Charan tries hard look intense Sanjay Dutt looks like forced play Sher Khan. There slur movements fight scenes speech speaks. A couple things make things even worse - dialogue music. You don't know worse - iconic original lines retained new lame lines. A moments disbelief - could know 'jab tak baithne ki ijaazat...' anyone Amitabh Bachchan 'Sher Khan beimaani ka kaam bhi...' anyone Pran epic fail? The songs less annoying. My take item number secret. Not aesthetically displeasing condescending audience, manner break flow story irritating bit all. Here two songs fit bill. Zanjeer also ridiculous background score. At first when, 'raghupati raghav...' played fight sequence, I wondered projectionist goofed turned Satyagraha's soundtrack. Unfortunately, not. And background track repeated almost every time Vijay fight sequence. Oh well... I understand even nothing better do, you'd better watching Zanjeer 1973, one cannot completely written - maybe I seen worse, await much worse.
