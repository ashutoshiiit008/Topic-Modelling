Non-Hindi, black white films - especially silent ones - often receive mixed reactions watch TV. I’ve lived roommates - film enthusiasts - believe me, unless you’re true blue movie buff, silent film last ‘must watch’ list. Metropolis, made 1927, however ordinary silent film. It shares two reputations - one, expensive silent film ever made. And two, Adolf Hitler’s favourite film. But really appreciate Fritz Lang’s dystopian drama, acknowledge incredible amount effort global collaboration gone making recent version DVD. Edited parts film patched together South America, parts Europe still lost transit. Signs visible film - example, text flows images sometimes appears different font. There several abrupt cuts easy make certain sequences compensated text. Fortunately, none doesn’t take away awe watching Metropolis. Fritz Lang’s technique shoot bustling metropolis amazed sheer genius create believable city using miniatures like that. There floods, explosions, transformations, robots - despite absence sophisticated technology special effects, Lang makes futuristic city look far believable Love Story 2050. Crowd movements example, painstakingly shot realise easy filmmakers today. The plot almost Orwellian, message not. The film unfolds like science experiment. The point film wants make stated beginning: “The mediator mind hands must heart.” It must timely one - almost prophecy era Industrial Revolution begun divide capitalists working class beginning show. Which why, film hailed classic - today, gap rich poor widest ever been. In film, gap demonstrated using upper city, represents luxuries man could want - gyms, libraries, playgrounds; lower city (the depths), working class living pure apathy. It’s city chief’s (Joh Frederson) son Freder falls love working class woman (Maria), realises must mediate differences capitalist father (who runs city) workers. The film right amount layers drama - there’s tension father (Joh) son, Freder; there’s scientist Rotwang appears obedient Joh, tricks sleeve; there’s Machine Man (a replica Maria, menacing evil) things possible - including erotic dance number - destroy unity working classes. It’s silent film, actors screen enough expressions break language sound barrier. Brigitte Helm, plays Maria Machine Man, best lot. She seems divine Maria, raised eyebrow look Machine Man is, well, pure evil. Gustav Frohlich, saviour, Freder impressive. Alfred Abel Joh Fredersen, capitalist tycoon unlike silent film actor - he’s loud, yet twitch facial muscles dose invectives would. Rudolf Ken Rogge plays mad scientist Rotwang perfection. Some may interpret Metropolis preachy, I think engaging story. It advocates themes non-violence responsible industrialization. If message, watch film get insights touches mind Adolf Hitler.
