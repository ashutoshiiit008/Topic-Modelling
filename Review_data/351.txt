The annoying bit zombie films story doesn't move, zombies do. It starts people becoming zombies, one inexplicable way other. It goes deadpan, gory zombies staggering around beautiful scenery. Living people fight dead people hour+ long chase sequence. And people beat zombies last 15-20 minutes. That people eating people. Go Goa Goneis less same, except lot fun along way headed towards definite purpose. Go Goa Gonestarts usual toilet sexual humor you'd find film involving three bachelors living together, oft-repeated Hardik joke. But, unique style keeps interested. And course, waiting zombies appear. Meanwhile, beyond commonplace humor one-liners make laugh loud. With context, even 'globalization' dialogue, put trailers, works. The dialogue witty yet, filmy. It kind language friends would speak other. The delivery course, perfectly timed, else lines would fallen flat. Kunal Khemu, Vir Das Anand Tiwari carry buffoonery well. Puja Gupta's Luna exists film doesn't become 'man'ly. But well nevertheless. Saif Ali Khan usual screen presence, isn't required much really. In fact, film characters all. The main leads start typical good, bad in-between trio. The distinguishing lines soon merge three afraid keeping humor intact. Yet, except couple times, doesn't seem place. I'd think zombie films would categorized horror films, Go Goa Gonedoesn't fall horror category. Sure, share gore intestine like things pulled necks still doesn't qualify horror. Also, background score quite different kind associate horror films even thrillers. In fact, Go Goa Gonegoes beyond genres even comment things like group dynamics terms become leader group goes astray without leader. You additional layer 'social message' stuck it. While, I'm much favor adding meaning film merely slapping message end, I'm glad Go Goa Gonehad one. At least zombie film people walking around like zombies. Also, manner message unfolds makes pallatable, except last revision lessons "moral story" dialogue characters. Similarly, couple instances people behave dumber zombies. Clearly, situations added bring variety otherwise flat plot. But, done good humor hence pass by. What makes Go Goa Gonea film worth watch certainly fine manner comedy horror/thriller combined. Who would thought day would come I'd say, I'm looking forward sequel zombie film!
