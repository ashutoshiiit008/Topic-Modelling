You see Naxalites' point view administration country cannot bothered poorest poor citizens. You understand frustration handful police officers pretty much rendered impotent wanting right thing. You wonder right wrong. A movie done pretty much done job. Only thing wish weren't distracted relationships shallow songs including item number! I really would like know research positive impact absolutely avoidable item song film. Especially film takes seriously expects nothing less us. Similarly, I understand need emotional base subject grim rotting roots political administrative systems India. But, half-hearted one? Adil Khan Kabir's (Abhay Deol) friendship isn't given base convincing enough make us invest dilemmas. In fact, seems internal struggle far friendship concerned, first place. The story could well told without relationship, except maybe weak point trying make situation naxal areas bad conscientious person would choose side personal relationships, pukka Namak Haraam/Avatar style. The flakiness pervades friendship Mrs. Khan (Esha Gupta) Kabir. It also seeps conveniently Kabir accepted Naxal movement film, right end. Esha Gupta short dispensable role adds melodrama over-acting. Arjun Rampal's labored attempt showing restraint visible. While stiff body language might go well hardened inspector, yet I couldn't wonder depth another actor could brought character. Anjali Patil hand comes across frustrated angered rebel plays. Abhay Deol usual fits role ease. The rest cast balanced Om Puri, Manoj Bajpai Kabir Bedi convincing influencers one hand uneasy performances actors play ministers, senior police officers businessman's son. Fortunately though, things, distractions take away balance writer, Anjum Rajabali maintained presenting arguments Naxalites. It argued law administration system painted thick shade gray. But things portrayed corrupt system ring untrue difficult believe? Hardly. Similarly, dialogue written lot thought key striking balance. Yet, feeling creeps las half hour film watched something halfway through. Of course, war still on. But I wish either whole friendship angle completely eliminated given lot depth would added many layers film's social message.
