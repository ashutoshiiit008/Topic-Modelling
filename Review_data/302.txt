In spirit full disclosure, 8.30 AM show I booked cancelled due technical glitch. The 11 AM show I rebooked for, started 11.50. So bear mind I mighty, almost 4-hour long frustration pent up. Even so, finally trailers show began, I dutifully reminded myself. "It's makers' fault. It's Prateik Babbar's fault can't act show didn't start time." As film reels on, I tell myself, "Oh don't harsh even though better make-up recently acquired knowledge lip shades sundry. This regional film trying reach wider audience. Accept sensibilities." And stop talking yourself. With reprimand 15th minute film, I promise give film fair chance. But Ek Deewana Tha didn't want it. I allowing acknowledge problems inter-religion marriages persist bygones 80s 90s, even claim embraced 21st century; something sweet innocent 'love first sight' even character couldn't care for. I'm going judgmental good-for-nothing is. I appreciate fed characters white black, it's natural get annoyed lead lady thoroughly confused priorities life. It happen real life, doesn't it? And then, I gave up. Groping slivers hope isn't good enough. The actors look feel real. Awful dialogue delivery + awful dubbing + awful make-up = total exasperation. In addition, romantic film grows twists turns, one would tire of, even thriller. More later. First, please tell news byte, somewhere, talks director, Gautham Menon repents choice Prateik Babbar Amy Jackson. I haven't seen Tamil films I'm told Ek Deewana Tha's original amazingly touching film. We could even blamed Amy Jackson's dubbing lack variation intonation, one fish Finding Nemo expressive Pratiek Babbar put together. It's miracle then, couple scenes make sense spectacular moment two. There even misplace well-done father-son scene Sachin Khedekar Prateik BabbarJust beginning get hopeful click chemistry biology, cut rather rudely next scene land next abrupt event leads pair's life. The background music adds chops one scene another sometimes dishevels bang middle film. That coming film touted musical A. R. Rahman Javed Akhtar. I don't know Gautham Menon genius marketing team came tag-line, head hangs shame. What could still sweet film blast-from-the-plast kind-of way completely lost last half hour so. In attempt something different regular love story, writers going amok finally confusing like lead character want film. The climax cheat one's realize, relaxed, build-up whole film purposed mind, writing energies focused making audience guess double-guess. You realize first two hours film nothing really going them. I started out, hoping I wouldn't let frustration delay show come way enjoying romantic film. As I recount things went wrong, I wonder might think I allowed come way completely disappointed.
