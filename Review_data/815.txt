The Pursuit Happiness (or Happyness?) Director Gabriele Muccino’s previous film played screens India. Ostensibly, made decent amount money. Mr. Muccino attempts return familiar territory, latest called Seven Pounds. It Hollywood’s bankable African American star Will Smith (a thousand pardons, Lawrence Fishburne Morgan Freeman) proceeds navigate terrain, heart.(see film understand!) The script adopts following structure: Will Smith’s character, Ben Thomas introduced; see actions carries out, actions seem make sense first. We understand something wants needs, script gives clues, barring hint hint (though even imbecile could piece together). At least scriptwriter director intended it, I assume. The glorious resolution end, would understanding, leave viewer feeling epiphany, else would pale it. Alack alas, film plays out. Will Smith angular hollow eyed, attempts forlorn air, goes duties. We see playing God, eyes brimming unshed tears tattered air desperation. How good act? Woeful say least woe betide viewers. His efforts look miserable distress audience. Ben enters relationships people; problem script order make sure heart right place suitably moved, director / script mandates wonderful human emotions (and sure Box office magnet), Romantic Love, present. This development unfortunately feels orchestrated forced, ensures film necessarily loses track characters, except show minute two. It Romance way, special romance. We suddenly get see lot honey golden frames; two protagonists framed soft dewy light, clichés throw – candles, dinner, sweet gifts, cute dog, course bed. All predictable; script setting us point. As Ben gets desperate, we. When end, possibly thinks Ben, could agree more. The time come, thankfully, movie wends way climax preposterous, would need whole truck load good old fashioned liquid recover. And come tears, literally. Everyone film cries continues cry sorts places, accompaniment softly gurgling piano. Having done noble deed, is, bring film “logical” conclusion, director bids us farewell. Should watch it? Yes, definitely, want see infinitely sad Will Smith every frame. You would also want watch it, case trying make impression sweet something next door, show person refinement deep sensitivity. For rest us boors, best avoided. PS What Woody Harrelson film? Oh Tempera! (It definitely Oprah!)
