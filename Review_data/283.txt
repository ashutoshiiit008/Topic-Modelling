Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive begins cursive pink-font opening-credits, kind background music would hear car - semi-thumping, lounge-ish beats 80s retro-electronica pinch (take bow Cliff Martinez). We introduced film’s unnamed protagonist, Driver (Ryan Gosling). With half toothpick, scorpion jacket brooding eyes, moves entire film unnerving calmness. I can’t say journey film though – Drive manages break hypnotic spell, moment get grovoe controlled, thought-provoking cinematography trance like, anticipated soundtrack. Drive neo-noir, smooth sporadic film edgy hero (and I use word deliberately) escapades. Refn uses archetypal split-lighting establish driver’s character, followed hovering cloud western film (in protagonist’s unadulterated badass). By day, works car stuntman part time, garage. By night, however, drives. No really, words, "If I drive you, give time place...I drive. " Abandoning morals (quite unlike job overpowering image), stands amused observer corrupt world he’s part of. There, Driver gives slight aftertaste films like Taxi Driver. The film uses popular, pulp fiction-esque narrative. Of course, treatment stylistic, nasty bit tease. It’s hide seek what-now wow-really? You see similar signs – pink font, opening sequence establishes feat protagonist, jarring car chases, bad guys almost like contemporary Mafia lookalikes. Yet film doesn’t take moment jump subtle cat-and-mouse chase full blown blood war. There skull-breaking, knife diving moments scene almost Refn wanted celebrate idea violence making us believe never going cross paths. Driver’s bond neigbour Irene (the sensual Carey Mulligan) silent, furthered relationship kid, husband, Standard (Oscar Issac) prison. The film takes bloody turn, Driver helps Standard heist clear debts issues. Here starts predicament (read: almost sadistic war blood splatters.) However, point Drive, stylistic treatment fights good evil takes plot film. You realize soon second half story abandoned take upon intended feel film – one given glimpses first half, mostly Drivers lilted, calm voice brooding eyes. You also question driver’s motive violence, somewhere amidst rhythmic visuals colossal build up, Refn fails establish concrete relationship Driver Irene. You don’t understand someone like Driver, otherwise seems like doesn’t give two bricks anything, would undergo mess woman barely spoke 8 words with. Once accept move past questions, Drive hard-hitting, dark downright entertaining film. Might work faint-hearted, good thing Drive gives enough think-ponder-mesmerize violence starts.
