Right one cheesiest title sequences past years, second maybe Welcome tell going paraphrase title "Who I love?" kisse badla loon? "Who I avenge?". But yet fair around here, don't pass judgment we've seen end credits. No respite sight. Oh well... What bad film? I think it'll easier start what's good film. Well, see Arshad Warsi's comic timing genius he's trying make best sorriest lines ever. Especially tries muster half-a-smile references masturbation. Why (no pun intended), I'm willing give right tiny toe know. Ashish Chodary ... ok, that's typo trying crack good one, that's name spelt opening credits! Anyway, Ashish - I admire capacity make fool - film film film - playing dog fetching biscuits acting human-silly. Anyway, can't associate much intelligence someone who's signed script like this. Ditto Yash Tonk. The women women films - play dumb, hold one expression throughout charged fine changed it. Same rules seemed applied costume designer told make unwearable outfits possible. The story line course three friends generate loads money though don't really means livelihood. Sorry, I digress. One falls love girl can't stand sight two. And battle begins. But since enough masala make 80s film, villain, inspector, godfather thrown in. And since film 80s, random references sprinkled across. Actually it's wrong call references random that'd like saying random. The entire product one huge display arbitrary human misbehavior. What exactly anyone thinking writing, directing, producing something like beyond me. Just plain incomprehensible.
