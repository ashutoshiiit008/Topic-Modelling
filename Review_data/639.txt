Playing around timeline cool must fun making film. It stands different keeps audience alert. But NOT price pay holes main plot. When happens non-linear narration take away lot film, instead adding value. And exactly happens Monica. In effort keep us thinking, director, Sushen Bhatnagar forgets give us key events story. The ones could gotten us interested characters feel them. The emotion I feel Monica Jaitley, "maybe, deserved it." Which would fine I thought Sushen Bhatnagar wanted us feel way. But, way case put forth parents' lawyer, looks like Sushen wanted sympathy us. I felt little sorry small-town girl, Monica husband's shadow; maybe talent, doesn't quite believe good anything. I would proud confident, enigmatic person changes into, I knew brought change. If I part transformation, comes across mere convenient jump storywriter. The film also refuses answer important questions. What big deal becoming "special correspondent"? Can one "special correspondent" really cause sort-of damage powerful politician - politician doesn't need say wants way, people around know? Why mass population get interested justice Monica? And unanswered questions. There whole different list logical loopholes. A sample - Why judge humoring lawyer going irrelevant conjectures? I got tired him, didn't judge? Sure keeps saying relevant, once, told how. Fortunately, though bad. I liked bits Monica confronting fears. Divya Dutta gives extremely strong performance. I'm sure actor completely drain scenes. If nothing else, I'd watch film gives actor always played side roles, chance carrying film. And does, whatever extent writing allows her. Beyond writer's failure. The writer also should've given characters chance too. They pretty one-dimensional don't get involved one bit. Two characters really deserved actors carry - Monica's loser husband, Raj (Rajit Kapoor) menace-cum-gentleman politician (Ashutosh Rana). Raj gets marred theatrical acting (not actor can't anything else) politician left half-baked. It's sad project interesting characters, compelling story couldn't become watch-worthy film. The culprits - details writing failed attempt stylized execution.
