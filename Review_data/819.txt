If I pick one Hindi film year shows largest heart, truly symbolizes victory sheer passion towards cinema storytelling, would Hansal Mehta’s comeback film hiatus, touching eye-opening Shahid. The film traces real life story criminal lawyer Shahid Azmi, murdered defense Muslim man accused accomplice 26/11. Shahid’s story begins when, youth living Govandi (an eastern suburb Mumbai) traumatized Bombay riots 1993, flees jihadi camp ‘training’. The conflict interpretation Islam ‘trainers’ camp forces come back Bombay, albeit arms police. Then begins journey path justice, something believes till end. Shahid Azmi’s story clearly bursting told; man decided fight couldn’t fight themselves; man paid price justice life. I’m glad Hansal Mehta destined bring story back public consciousness. After interesting Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar truly underrated Chhal, slew highly forgettable films made promising career head southwards. With Shahid, hopefully career head towards should. While film’s biggest strength undoubtedly story Shahid himself, really makes cinematic version memorable cast film. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub Shahid’s older brother excellent. He actor played role Manu Sharma recent screen adaptation Jessica Lal’s story. Anyone loathed (because good negative role) bound change heart film. Prabhleen Sandhu Shahid’s wife Mariam pleasing presence. Kay Kay Menon small, significant cameo absolute delight watch. One really misses incredible actor. Tigmanshu Dhulia Vipin Sharma small roles terrific, rest supporting cast. But film ultimately belongs Raj Kumar Yadav, man plays title role. He invests character aplomb one easily feel helplessness, confusion, ambition, purpose rough edges character has. With every single performance his, Raj Kumar underlines fact one talented dynamic young actors India today. Hopefully, filmmakers able channel talent challenge even complex roles. Strictly film, Shahid isn’t without flaws. With budget financial viability perhaps foremost reasons, film suffers technical production-related problems. Right issues like DSLR footage blending rest film, production value standard film like ideally had, fact even though film tracks nearly two decades Shahid’s life, doesn’t visually age – problems stick like thorns intense experience film otherwise is. Also, film could crisper. Often, lot time spent highlighting Shahid’s character traits, especially right start film later film. I’m sure connection fact editor film, Apurva Asrani, also one screenplay writers. Either way, shortening film could possibly strengthened impact. Still, isn’t often conviction passion director team shines film clearly faced number obstacles making. Just that, Shahid film deserves seen big screen.
