If avid film buff, wouldn’t buy rent Taken’s DVD looking cover. It cryptic picture Liam Neeson blah line: “I don’t know are, don’t let daughter go, I find kill you.” Deja vu? Precisely point. It’s seen-that-heard-about premise: daughter gets kidnapped, daddy run park find back. No wonder released, despite positive reviews, film poor start box-office. Nevertheless, thanks word-of-mouth publicity, achieved level success DVD. That’s less I chanced upon film - it’s theatrical release blink-and-miss. But strong recommendations friends forthcoming. I’m never much Liam Neeson fan film made one. It’s clear he’s casting agent’s delight far thrillers considered. And looking back, I’d probably cast film adaptations Dan Brown novels (The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons.) Taken pretty much DVD cover says - Bryan Mills (Neeson), father separated daughter wife, everything get back gets kidnapped overseas holiday France, girlfriend. There’s catch here: kidnappers want ransom. The film racy, full action, wastes time verbosity. Mills former CIA agent pursuit kidnappers fraught little obstacles. On lighter note, I wondered film-makers suggesting nail criminals, world may produce Iron Man Batman, someone extensive career behind CIA equipped necessary skills - investigative, medical, physical even flirtatious - conquer odds. I impressed screenplay trimmed scene right time. The fights extremely well-shot. As viewer, feel arms getting gentle involuntary jerk punch villians screen, clear film got complete attention hypnotic way. Another good reason may like Taken, even empathise, even get frightened context kidnapping manner unfolds. I won’t surprised remember Taken you’re travelling new city mull request stranger share taxi ride. There’s message somewhere. As Facebook Twitter civilisation, we’re witnessing decline barriers trusting people. Taken doesn’t sermonise issue - rather portrays tension Mills’ character shown rather worrisome father. As former CIA agent, cannot trust people easily - he’s seen much ugly side governments, rebellious groups white collar criminals. I’m glad film-maker kept film free monologues. Though, ending little incomplete. By way concluded, felt like ending ‘Father’s Day’ film. The true heroes Taken direction screenplay. Director Pierre Morel, known best cinematographer makes formidable team writers Luc Besson (the Transporter series, La Femme Nikita television series) Robert Mark Kamen (the Karate Kid series, Gladiator, The Fifth Element) put together film that’s edge-of-the-seat thriller true sense. You need prepare watch film. Just eject DVD tray, load film, get popcorn enjoy.
