Remember family feuds whose existence depended "killing romance"? Boy king, Girl maid-servant. Boy Hindu, girl Muslim. Boy vegetarian, Girl meat-eater, Boy's family girl's family enemies, oh I forget Boy poor, girl rich. We little bit mish-mash themes Jashnn. Which ones? Does really matter? It written shoddily doesn't justice whatever charm films enough keep away one. The film pretty much ends starts except sudden transformation characters. Losers protagonists really, really charming storyline around intriguing make film watchable. While modernized love story sudden turn climax closes palatable all. Neither Adhyayan Suman character Akash charming. We grant Adhyayan covers huge range emotions. But, something personality doesn't cut lead actor. And doesn't much extra talent excuse lack killer looks pull through. Anjana Sukhani hand mildly pleasant surprise. There times dialogue delivery flat. But glimpses single twitch face communicate character feels. Alas, long distances lie between. I would able comment Shahana Goswami's act, dispeakable wardrobe didn't distract throughout film. Sure, needed slutty look, necessary dress hideous outfits didn't flatter all. Also body language matched roadside prostitute rather otherwise supposedly grand lifestyle - standing legs wide apart don't go plush flats flat screens, etc. For movie coming Bhatt camp, Jashnn non-hummable music alright lyrics. None impressive repeat value all. After going this, thinking back film, I understand direction could lot worse. I also imagine look feel lot less kitschy. But wouldn't enough one sit movie. Sleep - maybe. At least I felt like I good nap credits rolled, though I watch entire film.
