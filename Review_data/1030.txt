If lucky enough potential Hrishikesh Mukherjee amongst us, would Shoojit Sircar. Vicky Donor made laugh, brought tear eye, made think, made care characters - setting could accept real-life. And it's like film doesn't good share quirky characters (We whisky drinking granny, goodness' sake!) quirks made look like could easily belong neighbor's family, own. For subject taboo giggle-inducing 'sperm donation', Vicky Donor awesome job making regular even though terms thrown on-the-face. Each time Anu Kapoor says 'sperm' hand-gesture makes laugh loud, right till end. That's good comic timing - signature phrase symbol assigned character makes laugh despite repetition. Also, that's good writing - time passed two repetitions right things come either hilarious entertaining, both. Yes, non-hilarious entertainment. The drama romance engaging. After really long time, I didn't problem believing couple said loved other. Otherwise, either said early, one blind other's love, mushy, lines ridiculously shallow. Vicky Donor gets romance 'Goldilocks' perfect. Same goes drama. This coming member audience thinks she's enough loud Punjabi characters dialogue thrown her. Beeji (Kamlesh Gill), Dolly (Dolly Ahluwalia) daughter-in-law-mother-in-law chemistry isn't something going forget hurry yet want revisit every while. I like Ayushman Khurana - even beyond dimples. He easy-going screen presence actor proud of. His easy-go-lucky Punjabi munda mannerism casual difficult imagine character. I guess we'll wait next that. Yami Gautam sweet charm makes reach sadness within she's smiling, comfort she's obviously sad identify PMS-ing shrill yelling she's angry. Each character depth warmth - even pushy Dr. Chaddha (Anu Kapoor) alter ego form assistant. Ashima's (Yami Gautam) dad aunt add flavor mix - especially scenes written father daughter. The extent dad go convince daughter anything - choice husband she's silly upset husband - might seem outlandish, we've seen heard similar stuff real-life. The screenplay intriguing too. It rather obviously episodic, five clear parts. The first covered promos Dr. Chaddha trying convince Vicky donate sperm. Then Vicky wooing Ashima followed amazingly witty coverage inter-caste marriage - subject covered death Hindi cinema. The second half sombers cover serious issues entire clean albeit slightly mushy wrap-up. And midst this, social message never becomes preachy thus effective, family faces issue like this. After walking theater, superficial thoughts fun last two hours, watched good film. But half hour later, processed film whole, I realized I liked even I thought. And primarily - Vicky Donor many elements I thought I've enough would've grudgingly given benefit doubt filmmaker writer cover even one freshness. But boy-meets-girl, Punjabi madness, repetitive dialogue/phrases, caste-based family issues, post-marital woes recovery - Vicky Donor covers smile face mine. It could novel concept tie in.
