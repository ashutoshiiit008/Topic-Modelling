A 600-seater multiplex hall filled capacity Peepli [Live] film stars, remote village, promo material made obvious one cannot expect glamor it. We know 'we serve masala audience demands' days numbered. fingers crossed Yes, crowd seemed enjoying film. I understand 'enjoying' rude word use talking film based others' misfortunes. But seems valid, see people laughing dark joke cracked along huge roar laughter every time cuss word used. Once novelty seeing everyday talk screen wares - whole-range Hindi foul language, young easily-amused boys giggly girls get involved rotten situation state - least involved one could imagine reality. Pathos central character comes without speak 5-10 lines 100 minutes. Such subtlety runs Peepli [Live]and every reminding moot point it's trying make. The obvious commentary unintelligent coverage issues media, absolute ridiculousness Government yojanas (subsidy/benefit/upliftment programs) continuously punctuated references level underneath. It us then, dig deeper. Going skin-deeper there's ton see: Contrast two strong women - one urban, one rural - one empowered 'master' life others, mercy feeble men life; suicide must come easy farmers close death either; left mercy news-creators dying farmer's feces Saif Ali Khan's smooch competing headlines - everything hunky-dory?; lost conscientious young bureaucrat/politician/journalist there. His soul sale, least yet; hope simpleton rise make decisions despite entire world wanting take advantage situation; on. So many things said - using lyrics, music, backdrop, props - first five minutes decide stop overwhelmed promise another watch grasp more. This first time I decided absorb surface. The performances close reality almost feels like documentary. The focus developing presenting situation rather building characters arcs. The photography adds 'real' milieu home-video feel - intentional shakes jerks. There exaggerations, doubt. And make film little slapsticky taste also tone film. Then again, extension we've seen real life read papers. The newsy nature manner situation rolls also makes film predictable. So, next? A teeny-weeny bit 'nothing'? If even one bureaucrat/politician scratches head watching film, [Peepli Live] consider successful. Audience? Hopefully, won't mere fashionable like film. Hopefully, us go beyond 'jobs'. Even it's take task improving nation, least begin continue audience demands films ordinary - good, bad, ugly - Peepli [Live]is three, quality gritty content.
