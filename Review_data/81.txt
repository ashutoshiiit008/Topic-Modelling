Late teens. Most us old enough get nostalgic them. We tough time. We obeyed. We rebelled. Always Kabhi Kabhi picks four us tells story. Or rather tries to. Because, stories make films, need exaggerated. And hyperbole goes wary makes mistake parents made parents might make. Nag, rant, berate. The set-up, problems chosen, build-up weren't bad all. From over-attentive, selfish parent perennially disappointed dad missing-in-action socialite-parents - covered. But second half takes drastic overdo either silly lover's tiffs situations beyond unreasonable. To top off, lame dialogue amateurish delivery. I liked Zoa Morani best. She one carried attitude assigned - "whatever". The two boys, Ali Fazal Satyajeet Dubey tolerable. Though might intolerance chocolate-boy-looks pretentious cuteness coming here. Same goes Giselle Monteiro. But least character came across believable. The lasting impact though "blah". It doesn't remain chick-flick starts as, execute message wants put across well. A similar point much, much better executed F.A.L.T.U. That us right dreams. That one generation liked Shakespeare, doesn't mean generations generations later still played vein. But ridiculous cop-out chose go with!? Maybe would worked showed, didn't tell. And good measure, King Khan spell us end credits. I guess, thank stars, didn't show one 18-year olds.
