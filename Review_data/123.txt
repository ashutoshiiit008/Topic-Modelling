You grant Bang Bang delivers promises trailers. Lots action, tolerable stunts, bit coochie-coo incredibly good-looking lead pair lots on-screen time two, individually together - pretty much mindless, attempt creating interest plot itself. Some stunts look cool, especially us exposed enough Hollywood. That seems Bang Bang's first selling point - Bang Bang, machine gun kind kind movie admits isn't enough of. You works - bikes, cars, race cars even, choppers, boats, water skis not. You Hrithik Roshan flying buildings cliffs emerging deep seas. But, know sake there. More "cool" idea leading insertion film rather story requiring creativity cool idea. Pretty much goes film's second selling point - Hrithik Roshan Katrina Kaif - gorgeous looking people are, supposedly don't require character devlopment, depth even half-decent story even decent chemistry. Just presense actors ought keep audience happy. For sake completeness, I mention obvious - abdominal muscles certainly worked facial muscles. Body language? Baah! Who needs body? Any attempt injecting emotion then, seems farcical. Not emotion much place film. So what, it's patriotism chore wants revenge drama. You'd think would little room good song dance film like this, especially given Hrithink Roshan's presence. But much ask for. Just case, still wondering, entire plot pretty much pointless given "twist" climax. Since film selling points, resorts blatant product placements much Krrish 3 now, I started associating Hrithik Roshan product placement. And yet, I can't completely put film down. At least, true-blue action stunts attempted. They might executed well, hopefully get better next film next. Meanwhile, though meant long weekend, one film running TV luxury flipping channels.
