The mere sound phrase “plight widows”, grips heart. Is then, difficult make movie issue, stirs inside? Looks like is. Water, leaves feeling cheated still waiting punch, hard hit sensibilities, even movie done. The movie starts bang. The opening sequence makes heart go little Chuyia (Sarala), 7-8 year old widow. But, narrative begins fizzle first ten minutes never regains impact. And climax seemed illogical. The touching moment comes lead pair first romantic rendezvous. Though magical, sweet. However, give points preachy whiny. It tells story, lets audience answer unasked question, "Is way be?" This movie worth watching performances. Widows different age groups varied temperaments, portrayed really well. You almost see younger one one next age group grows older. Sarala makes feel innocent rebellious attitude. Lisa Ray, teen widow, wants saved loveless life widow asylum. Seema Biswas, plays perfection, role widow late 30s resigned fate, still understands desires younger widows. You see strength gives despite internal struggle stick faith, expressions body language. Manorama, plays classic pain-in-the-wrong-place-opportunist. Her double standards dare defy her. You know done job well, feel like giving one tight slap right across face! Vidula Javalgekar plays minor role widow (called aunty widows) approaching end life. Her mannerisms love food reminds Chunibala devi played similar role Pather Panchali. The problem though individual characterization performances don’t disappoint, relationships individuals underdeveloped…certainly wanting chemistry. Be relationship Narayan (John Abraham) Kalyani (Lisa) Madhumati (Manorama) Chuyia (Sarala), difficult understand motivations. E.g., Why Narayan like Kalyani? The movie show reason Chuyia obey Madhumati. The beginning makes squirm feel “oh boy! I really going depressed end movie”. But, fortunately unfortunately, happen.
