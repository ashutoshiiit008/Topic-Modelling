Update It's always nice DVD features provide insight really took make film. Luckily, DVD Elysium least justice front. The DVD two decent featurettes related film. The first one, titled 'Collaboration: Crafting Performances Elysium', director, Neill Blomkamp, well others, talk primary cast film - Matt Damon, Jodie Foster Sharlto Copley. Roughly 13 minutes long, talks chosen, went characters performances. The second, 12 minutes long, called 'Engineering Utopia: Creating Society Sky'. It talks Elysium, utopian world located Earth film, conceptualized designed. It reminds tough filmmaking is, particularly crafting something visually spectacular Elysium. Most importantly, features give us peek mind Neill Blomkamp. His penchant talking current world issues using dystopian future setting exciting enough; fact indie filmmaker heart, one strong voice that. The thought put cast design film highlights really well. The DVD Indian language options unfortunately, would added bonus. The film makes fair home video watch, actually kind film seems better second watch - sign film truly layers. * No matter far future far back past film set, core values drive characters motivations remain quite same. Greed, ambition, delusions self-importance, love sacrifice; cinematic portayals always evoke emotional response. That's lies heart Neill Blomkamp's latest film, Elysium. Set year 2154, film - like many others recent past - shows dystopian Earth shambles disease poverty. The rich, course, solution - plush, artificial satellite world named Elysium; world governance system control less fortunate. Max one lowly citizens Earth, one always dreamed living Elysium instead. In terms look production, Elysium clear notch Blomkamp's highly acclaimed quite terrific film District 9 - also set dystopian future. Also, quite like District 9 spoke serious issue plaguing humanity - social segregation - potential threat increasing dependence private funding pose, Elysium looks real problems facing humankind today - class divides power select virtue financial superiority. Seen prism time seems distant us, depiction disparity contrast haves haves-not might seem little extreme film, don't pause look actually serious reflection society stands today. Isn't Antilla, example, current day version Elysium? The question, "How rich rich," answer today. In Blomkamp's futuristic, ultra-beautiful, lens-flared universe question underlined further. The poor obviously want more, rich want even more. Money, power, control; even want it. Then again, Elysium also within message still hope; cinema power effortlessly instill hope us. There ability love, feel, give anything sake loved one. Despite predictable turns film takes, largely works incredible detailing Blomkamp's vision future, electric hand combat fight scenes, key actors Elysium. There actors like Jodie Foster. She radiate warm, feminine presence much ease seem cold, cunning, calculative cruel. In Elysium, falls latter category, though character one easily sleepwalk through, doesn't make less effective. Matt Damon, plays Max, assumes physical personality go character, good always. He virtually carry film shoulders, pulls convincingly. The remainder cast, however, seldom anything functional. Elysium, quite like namesake haven rich film, means perfect. Despite breakneck pace, seems far longer runtime 111 minutes. Its rather linear graph serves purpose, doesn't grab hook way would liked, considering sheer scale visuals. Also - problem futuristic sci-fi films face - depiction usage technology strikes false notes. Even account liberty sci-fi film invariably allowed take, still logical loopholes tech, apart many times wonder could manage technology complex that, couldn't manage something simple this. Despite niggles, Elysium makes fun big screen watch. You might well watch today, never quite know tomorrow store.
