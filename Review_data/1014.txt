It ugly world there, indeed. And world under-world dons glamorous stars - used seeing ugly sides worlds pretty much know expect. It people like (most of) us, seen bad times, bad times - one point another considered drastic step, irrational one relieve miseries. No relationship spared, closest bonds questioned. Each character's selfishness brought forth shock. Ugly never allows moment comfort, that's film well-made one. On outside, Ugly kidnapped 10-year old girl. About half hour film, I wondered Anurag Kashyap wrote obnoxious, back-answering, over-smart girl I didn't get involved kidnapped. He banks "generic" care would 10-year old girl kidnapped worry behalf parents. Later film, I wondered, one character I would feel loyalties inclining towards? Nope. And exactly writer wants it. You don't like anyone all. Who rooting for? But root real life? Who like 100%, 100% time real life? As kidnapping takes backseat, I reminded question I death, "how long one mourn close-one's death?" A days later, move life. After point, that's characters seem dealt kidnapping. The unsaid conclusion seemed, "If found, she'd found now. Since hasn't found yet, must dead. We move on." This seems far removed think would react shocking, disgusting. This emotion evoked makes Ugly good film. In setting, set different actors, Ugly would felt like exaggeration dark characters. We used dark characters Anurag Kashyap film. We used seeing devoid glamor, usually carry style own. Here stripped that. They seem real, possible accept darkness part them. They streaks humanity them, either stern (Ronit Roy Bose) worn-out (Tejaswini Kolhapure wife) easy accept empty humanity. In fact, another reason Ugly rare film people seem care police. Sure, motivation involves senior's family, one point seem one's worried missing child. Watching casual attitude turn serious one high point early film. The one's job quite ruthlessly so. True Anurag Kashyap film content, even don't like it, over-powering actors performances taken granted. Each one us sees film could pick different character actor played best, one us would right. I'd pick Girish Kulkarni makes inspector plays Rahul Bhatt struggling actor wears false pride sleeves ones stay back me. And course gritty art work go grim nature film minimal dramatic background music sets tone deeper. While Mumbai lingers background, film proceeds, might hear loud frame seems want shout, "mumbai, sapno ka shahar, jahaan koi kisi ka nahi" - Mumbai, city dreams, relationship sacrosanct. Also, true Anurag Kashyap film, unmasking real people names father, mother, friend, lover, also rampant child kidnapping trading is; accepted prostitution part life; casual extra-marital affair on. Yes, ugly things life huge stamp dark humor. The kind feels unacceptable happening brings laugh happening another. Exactly disconnect happen? The film's content unsettling wouldn't want watch again, time feel like haven't grasped first go. It long seem stall places, lingering likeable. As well-made I find depressing film shows reality, I ready theater. After all, go way prove deeply immoral society humans point I don't want reminded reality s***s. And time, give reality gloss, day!
