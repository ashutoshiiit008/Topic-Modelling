"Pursuit happiness" "right vs. wrong" difficult existential themes Rockstar grapples with. It entails defining happiness, defining right wrong. Rockstar's ambition talk one loveliest paradoxes - order pursue happiness, unhappy. Rockstar also wants epic, romantic tragedy - Greek / Shakespearean / Devdas Laila-Majnu protagonist's namesake - take pick. Rockstar that, leaves many gaping holes comfort. I'm asking water-tight thriller type answers, I cannot suppress simple questions like - awfully large number talented people there, Janardhan aka JJ aka Jordan like call Ranbir Kapoor given much leeway despite obnoxious self. I understand getting away popular, nobody? Just willing sign agreements? This world full talented soul-sellers - I mean skill/art selling soul. I need understand lady love hasn't heard concept called divorce - involved families seemed open-minded enough. In film trying transcend another world, questions might seem mechanical. Having answer might mere hindrances larger purpose going beyond...to field right wrong meaning. But then, writer, Imtiaz Ali should've gone way made film questions didn't come - film I'd absorb abstractism without qualm. Don't put silly out-of-place bhabhi (sister-in-law). Don't put forced reason protagonist thrown house. And please don't suddenly put rebellious song social commentary awesome lyricist world's greatest music composer disposal. Your character, Jordan least bothered environment such. Maybe films rockstars show star's angst "society", symbolically literally, dole brilliantly choreographed cinematography. But rockstars dope avoid that, didn't you? Because room story, like room said song film. Thankfully, rest songs weave film making beautiful musical. And beautiful musical is. Given Himalayas Prague locations, I doubt anything cinematographer director could done wrong. And I doubt it'd bother many us long songs weren't picturized well. We'd rant it, pop CD listen music anyways, again. The good thing film doesn't become beauty places music. The not-so-good thing doesn't become much anything else either. While feel Jordan, solely Ranbir Kapoor desperately injecting life scattered screenplay Jordan's plain simple pain unabashed self-destruction. I usually refrain giving suggestions changes I'd liked film, means I'm talking different film altogether. But, here, I can't resist wondering Rockstar would've like neat clean, linear. It'd shorter sure. The non-linearity didn't bother per se, I found unnecessary taking away plot. It didn't let protagonists' suffering build up. Especially lead lady, Heer. I'm going go limb say gorgeous looking, hot (even loose, traditional Kashmiri wear) Nargis Fakhri mistake. The 'new films' discomfort visible. Her comic timing way manages mess good lines situations first half. (then writer give coming original lines). Anyway, maybe wait open like Kareena Kapoor Katrina Kaif. But damage done film hand. Her inability emote either suppressed wild-side, dilemma, physical frailty main weak link Rockstar. The back-and-forth screenplay I would able handle, I felt heroine's agony. I didn't connect therefore love lust her. The scarier thing I got feeling director treating film one-arm distance too, almost wary might get attached baby. I know many keen, I really don't see many us enjoying one is. Yes, yes, recommendation discounting high expectations.
