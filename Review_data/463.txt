What IS love? A movie, protagonist arrive, way, Venus (yes, planet) find humans fall love answered question, neigh? Apparently, love flimsy thing moves one person another time, equally flimsy reason. It argued film proposes that, flimsiness occurs till one finds 'true love'. But us delve deep movies altruistic purpose. For now, take home is, "if love someone, tell quick!" One thing I really appreciated filmâ€¦No, I'm sarcastic!...is 'other' guy lame character. He kind woo girl playing games win approval. This welcome refreshing change "Loser" "crooked-minded" 'other' guy see films. This one 'different' characterization Riteish Deshmukhs's performance two things make movie watchable. But, taken pinch salt. Interesting characters necessity luxury, audience thank makers one. And possibly engaging situation created, still take hold till climax. No luck, here. You know outcome well advance, rest formality. Formality also actors seem characters. The women look pretty chirpy-bubblies distract fact actually real plot. They look pretty, that's it. They even granted mush-gush "snore-snort worthy" romantic lines men ordained with. What's left then, filled supposed-comedy. A sample Kaushal, Rajesh's (Riteish Deshmukh's) friend's interest things sex. Just one single track running mind apparently Rajesh's alter-ego. If ever did, I'd think jokes worked like 10 years ago. I assume, youth towards film targeted, better humor that. And idea love. Oops! Did I admit I'm old tripe? I hope not, future comedy romance cinema, I hope not.
