I admirer Dan Brown, though I read Da Vinci code, I bother see film, I found book badly written. The fictional universe Angels Demons set time post events depicted Da Vinci code, initial dialogues make clear. This caper film, heist film, definitely tradition The Omen The Exorcist. Both The Omen The Exorcist Christian themes, dealt eschatological primordial fears mankind, portrayed Biblical imagery. This made films powerful terrifying time. Angels Demons far prosaic plot set modern world. Here premise treasure hunt; hunt hero figure various clues achieve outcome. The movie immediately comes mind Raiders Lost Ark, also based Biblical theme. But movie hero pizzazz, Indiana Jones trademark fedora bull whip embodied archetypical hero, masculine, dashing, intelligent. Tom Hanks Robert Langdon make it. His role flat, movie crinkle eyes spout Vatican history related dialogues. Maybe Hank's fault all, character Robert Langdon unidimensional. He exists prop keep plot moving, nothing else; understand relate human being, total absence character development. That holds true characters too, exception character Cardinal Strauss played Armin Mueller-Stahl. But even there, physiognomy presence Mueller-Stahl, gives character definition. Ewan McGregor Camerlengo maximum screen time key plot point, common come. Stellan Skarsgardâ€™s character could played mannequin would made absolutely difference all. The screen play makes Robert Langdon rush around Rome Vatican City, huffing panting, make way various churches, crypts, catacombs, accompanied pretty nuclear physicist (Ayelet Zurer Vittoria Vetra), absolutely nothing do, look suitably impressed worried turns. A hand held camera used convey sense urgency, gets repetitive time. The clues references Renaissance works art would appeal art historians (assuming factually true). There sense mystery, sense awe, clues uncovered. For film premise work, would mandatory; viewer must transported place time far removed everyday reality would time experience heightened contrast everyday present. The director throws scenes highlight struggle religion science, tilt either way. The climax final twist, one accepts another happening scheme things. There catharsis, upsurge emotion, definitely feeling redemption watch it. Ron Howard professional dished Hollywood processed fast food offering; one eats long one eating it, one conscious something going on, moment over, one cannot even remember vestige taste, however hard one tries. Strictly Dan Brown fans only.
