Did know? The rich - honest corrupt - love too, money, heart too. Baah! That Ajab Gazabb Love harps on. So, Madhuri (Nidhi Subbaiah) carries fancy bags, struts fancier shoes clothes seem wanting make fashion statement claims hate rich. If isn't superficial enough, scene later film, refuses take money family continuing lavish lifestyle sociology student money seems bought. If weren't enough rich Rajveer (Jackky Bhagnani) falls HAS lie he's poor ofcourse, hates rich. That's juice comedy romantic comedy. You wonder Ajab Gazabb Love targetted at. It couldn't economically not-so-well-to-do film make fun poor. Of course, isn't directly, masked making fun rich family compelled behave like poor. And course, script hundred lies cover one like Rajveer initiated. Not one scene devoid pretentious melodrama giving whole film spoofy feel. A spoof what, wonder. Hindi films? Really? If serious intention, didn't fit whatever called story. The melodrama brought extremely over-the-top acting support cast led front Kirron Kher. Darshan Jariwala tries bring calm Arshad Warsi make attempt mix comic timing south Indian accent. Nidhi Subbaiah extremely regressive shallow role play whatever it. Jackky Bhagnani starts fine, soon enough becomes run-of-the-mill mush typical movie stereotypes so. However, one loud, hearty laugh seemed like 100% 20 people watching film Jackky oh-so-dramatically makes serious 'sacrifice' dialogue ends ridiculously lame line possible. Not many kind lines. But one hilarious predictable. And course, patience unpredictability tested subjected song blue. The choreography, music lyrics unoriginal look trailers. You don't really expect much logic film falls genre rom-com intentionally over-the-top. But, you'd think would charming moments say father son mother son brother sister film seems much family core story. I guess that's bit much expect 'moments' even lead couple rom-com.
