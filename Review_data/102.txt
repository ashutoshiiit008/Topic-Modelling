It's skepticism I allowed mother sit film, reputation one famous torture scenes cinematic history. (Some Priyadarshan films also torture…more later.) Mom reads English slowly doesn't catch subtitles, clear Audition enough visually leave disturbed. When woke next morning, complained, "What terrible film showed last night. You watch kinda films!" But then, she'd said thing watching The Exorcist I've stopped heeding advice ever since then. Good horror gore awesome. A genuinely scary film generates nervous smiles laughter amongst viewers. Despite stating outset 'horror film', Takashi Miike's Audition, plenty going make squirm. In 1999, screened various film festivals, Audition gained reputation film witnessed walkouts members audience. Whether genuinely happened publicity-driven rumour, unknown, seen Audition DVD, I'm surprised did. The plot, despite feminist revenge fantasy, wafer thin. Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), widowed TV producer pretends Auditioning young women new show, fact he's really looking wife. He finds demure, young candidate attractive, film progresses, comes face face suspicious past. Director Takashi Miike uses mixture gore realism good effect, often teasing viewer using Aoyama's dreams. Thankfully, doesn’t portray casting couch Aoyama’s character producer lusting young woman, instead, simply person genuinely wanting someone spend life with. Nevertheless, sits audition, Miike’s opinion current casting process cinema becomes clear. “Man, I feel like criminal,” says Aoyama. Miike’s casting Asami (Eihi Shiina), prospective actress, spot on. Her submissive self, clean may seem, makes last person you’d trust suspect background. Her character – aptly described application form acting assignment – provides right amount intrigue Aoyama notice her, among numerous contenders turn audition. The writing several highpoints, especially climax, depends Asami’s lines chills rather simply gory visuals. It makes climax full several "facepalm" moments. All this, despite resorting 'creaky doors', 'monster bed' 'curtains wind' horror. Miike proves psychologically traumatised characters far effective sending chill spine, rather loud, thumping background scores mutilated corpses. Instead, story breaks new ground mounting horror ‘what-ifs’ ‘could been’, rather ‘what is’. What Miike leaves viewer guess, whether things would turned way do, Aoyama really looking cast actress. Audition elements come characterise Japanese horror cinema - long-haired actress dressed white gown head bent low, troubled history characters, jump cuts, absence background score intended solely scare. All symbolic Japanese horror noughties, time Hollywood facing writers’ block producing original genuinely scary films. Watch once, you’re alone.
