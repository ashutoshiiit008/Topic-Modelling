One main ingredients thriller actually thrills ought new revelation every while. Zid doesn't even try. Sure, new things happening, suspects remain same, new events reinforce suspicion suspects equally. Interestingly enough, reason suspect people story trying point finger vehemently, film strongly so. By things combination 2+ hour run-time, Zid doesn't keep attention lose interest altogether end. Sure, final twist good one, especially implies you've seeing far. But unfortunately, comes little late. Another thing got spooky, horror-style treatment given film. We talking haunted houses unhappy, troubled spirits. So, I didn't quite understand environment makes look ghost film. Such horror films known associated amount sexual content too. Zid doesn't disappoint quantity offer. The quality though completely missing terms chemistry two involved. While could fault actors bit, it's can't act all. You see hope Karanvir Sharma shows great restraint every scope go board. While Mannara compensates bit over-doing crazy bit, every while, shows slight change expression tells good act that's directed do. Shraddha Das hand, holds one expression - typical, sex-horror film glaze eye every lady film genre carries. That aside, writing doesn't engage like thriller should. It tries known hooks horror movies usually opt know can't keep involved - cleavage sex. Tells confident makers story tell, incidentally try boast - narrative capabilities. Unfortunately, shows lack thereof.
