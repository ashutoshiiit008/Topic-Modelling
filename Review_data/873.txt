Rugged raw - slums Mumbai display. There's also foreplay time taking us back forth back. It's slick. And drama escalates invite curiosity. All good. Then, disarray? Because wait wait something happen doesn't. Or happens, sudden seems completely place. Maybe that's reality filmmakers talk about. Or maybe that's drama supposed build. But, doesn't. With tagline translates "the fittest survives" constantly waiting film peak. And way film lit, shot, edited, holds promise. If technicalities good, there's hope story catch up, right? Well, instead three half, different, promising threads take nowhere. From name publicity look forward good board carrom. While, thankful last-minute comebacks, nothing root pray against. There aren't even good ricochet shots. And end realize carrom film could easily replaced skill Surya, (Siddharth), protagonist has. Oh expected metaphor life / system / protagonist striker bleh, say least. You look forward communal disharmony "different" angle particular story seems potential for. Another hope brutally stoned death. It's mere backdrop connected limbs story. You seek condolence fact realize towards end, going still alright. Also, meanwhile see lovely friendship Surya bum-chum, Zaid (Ankur Vikal) germinating. Both way, aspiring better themselves. One taking everything seriously; relentlessly smiling life. One taking straight road circumstantially possible; not-so-straight. One losing spirit; never willing say die. One courageous enough openly fight biggest goon around; except cheating goon. Both actors play characters mere functionally. And Anupam Kher, who's character, Inspector Farooq enters exits frame per convenience represent neutered law enforcement system. Even tells honest police officers walk smalltime goon's corpse get bigger fish, role choppy extremely disconnected. In whole affair, actor creates kind impact Aditya Pancholi Jaleel. A whole lot credit goes make-up artiste though. As proceedings go Surya's voiceover tries create link disjointed bits works much voiceover can. Sure, one worked partially, parts worked sign hope team skill set technical department starting point. Also, I feel story-telling much issue story itself. Well, there's always next time.
