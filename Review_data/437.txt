It's bad enough life share people can't stop talking cool are. Why would I want watch characters screen? Especially superficial full themselves. I, Me Aur Main plain vanilla story despite different modern take relationships, least broad stroke. It suffers usual complaint single character root for. Even though Anushka (Chitrangda Singh) obviously right, don't know enough root her. It doesn't help Chitrangda Singh getting worse emoting every film. Wide eyes pointed lips make lovely face look at, don't convince anything saying. Especially, put-on accent makes entire act seem even fake. Prachi Desai hand vibrant want know character, Gauri more. But, course, aren't let except token scenes featuring flamboyant confident nature. John Abraham plays wooden self, except couple scenes makes really believe oblivious people's existence, character, Ishaan is. The situations hardly connected. They series supposedly fun not-so-fun events stringed together. Yet, couple scenes done well. I especially liked awkward moment created Anushka Ishaan's sister's house. Thematically, modern solution found couple doesn't get along wants together one reason pretty mature, especially found film much mature otherwise. It almost like writer hit upon idea wanted convey worked backwards form story towards end. Another aspect today's life I, Me Aur Main touches upon mandatory relationship 60+ generation finds in. This generation doesn't see separation divorce option. This generation hasn't necessarily experienced love romantic sense word. I understand I, Me Aur Main hardly facet life, since broached subject, I would loved see it. Another interesting decision terms film-making one one lip-sync song. Considering Ishaan producer singing stars, certainly room more. Yet, lack songs sufficient either make good film now, it? With quite few, small things going right direction I, Me Aur Main, film entirety still feels like shallow take relationships. Quite sync title protagonist, good enough metaphor take even half-decent watch.
