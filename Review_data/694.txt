…And strange pestilence spread land people troubled. Their laments reached ears old king sorely beset. The noble king grew weary thought “Is within bounds kingdom, champion, mighty Knight would rid land scourge? And not, May Gods perchance send us one such?”... It years since Hollywood served good, hearty, sword fantasy epic. The eighties full likes Conan The Barbarian low budget imitators. Director Howard McCain takes plot old hills, incorporates new twist, gives us film surprisingly enjoyable. A similar film called The Thirteenth Warrior starring Antonio Banderas appeared 1990’s directed John McTiernan (who also gave us Predator Die Hard). Outlander’s plot includes elements Predator The Thirteenth Warrior treatment significantly different. Outlander stresses human relationships exist characters; themes Belonging Acceptance, family, community, honour, friendship, loyalty chivalry nicely brought out. This say film eschews action; director seems struck neat balance fights human relationships dexterity high wire artiste. John Hurt suitably beleaguered noble old King Rothgar Sophia Myles fair daughter, Freya. James Caviezel lean, stubble jawed, black short hair; clear Outlander amongst long haired, blond Norsemen. Caviezel’s portrayal character lacerated guilt suffering expressed blue eyes minimal speech. His acting surprisingly good given fact Hero action adventure film! (maybe practice The Passion Christ stood good stead!) Ron Perlman appears small cameo twin axe wielding warrior looks mean enough. And could one forget Creature? The special effects great, Beast good seen screen, hell fire, fangs, whip lashing tail. The screen play elicits chills, spills, emotional highs otherwise predictable plot. The climax gradually built up, sudden twist end, think yes over, yet time leave. The film message too, topical contemporary kind. Outlander film utilizes elements genre: lovely heroine, fierce potent Beast, lonely Hero, band unlikely comrades. It quite enjoyable director taken care add certain minimal depth main characters blend themes Hubris, Loss longing well Fate Free Will. Sit back enjoy.
