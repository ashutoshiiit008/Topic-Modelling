You roll eyes realise Heropanti yet another "love life" vs. "parental consent" film. As parents (read extended family) get vicious heart sinks another realisation hits - happens real life, even now. Unfortunately, Heropanti, real life decades films topic desensitized audience issues 90s. With nothing new say hero wears pink lipstick rescue, Heropanti becomes 2.5 hour long, predictable drone. I think opening titles artform themselves. Besides creativity goes making them, set tone film. So, huge turn-off Heropanti two lead actors' director's names opening title. Not short, doesn't show conceit? To me, decision says little team members mattered making film. I guess bell ring hear name Tiger Shroff film called, "Hero"panti popular tune Subhash Ghai's film shot Jackie Shroff (Tiger Shroff's father, uninitiated) Hero status early 80s. Such tactics tell upfront strong makers' confidence product is. Fair enough, tried inject Hero-ness Tiger Shroff giving so-bad-that-they-are-good lines - delivers much style possible make look fake forced already are. Then course, repeated tell scene setup line could repeated. Surrounded superficiality then, miracle, short get involved drama. You worry hero tight spot might get face brutal violence don't stomach for. That aura created around villains. Uncharacteristically film, Prakash Raj's character, Chaudhary grey enough keep interested. Of course, Prakash Raj, relatively restrained worried hero yet, see sympathizing him, even briefly. Unfortunately surprisingly, writers capitalize emotion character evokes. As expected, women pretty tools hero villain fight over. Her love hero taken granted. Her father emotionally blackmails believing property on. But again, that's women situations face real life. Also, real life, starlets get chance play action hero various shades pink lipstick. No, I cannot get it. At risk sounding sexist wanting deprive men cosmetics, on-the-face make-up unacceptable even women. And cannot escape distraction minute Tiger Shroff almost every scene (after entry). Not one expecting great shakes film called Heropanti. But, makers, 100% fresh starcast don't even attempt break mould disheartening. In fact, try milk popularity 20-year old film. Just sad.
