The first scene Rocket Singh makes wonder watching Wake Up Sid again. A not-so-good-at-academics protagonist find groove big bad world. While premise might same, apparatus used entirely different. No generic heart-strings pulled "aaaaws" audience. A straightforward, riff-raff film identify with. And laugh way everyday sense humor carries. BE WARNED THOUGH: regular Yash Raj film bright song every 10th minute. It's one editor went zip-zapp-zooom create fast pace shorter film. It's slowish. It's longish. And I impatient viewer, would first last complaints. And since I'm not, I reasons rejoice, quibbles there, scribbled notepad section. I'm willing sit beloved dark hall little longer watch things build-up slowly. Just case I miss finer details paid attention makers, ones might helped create warm atmosphere yet maintain hostile environment. Don't want run risk. Especially one well-known banners industry "Yash Raj Films" taking huge risk getting rid female lead altogether minimum songs. An hour movie I, fan non-standard Hindi films, wanted scream "Where's GIRL?" And huge risk budding "star" Ranbir Kapoor too. But like say, even superheroes take risks. Why shouldn't heroes, then? Many us don't aspire much. If aren't one them, know someone closely, happy get don't think deserve better. Our man, Harpreet Singh Bedi (Ranbir Kapoor) one them. He doesn't meddle life much. Until, one day, realization dawns. And let scare you. It's epiphany waiting happen. It slow, gradual call self. You'll see yourself, went Harpreet went baggage values. Rocket Singh also detailed comment corporate world specifically, cut-throat sales departments work. The sleaze shown, don't puke, shown matter-of-factly. After all, run rat-race too. And remarkably character transitions believable too. An academically challenged commerce student doesn't turn superhuman skill set thinks he's good at. When tables turn, subtly. The sweet talk, lies malice turn shrewd judgment calls. The "anti-heroes" dumbwits "just-do-it" bosses. They walk talk too. And sharp dialogues. In fact, first half hour reminded two TV series I admire crisp dialogues - West Wing Sports Night. These shows written Aaron Sorkin also wrote one favorite dramas A good men one favorite rom-coms The American President. So, I'm thinking Aaron Sorkin favorite Hindi writer-director Hrishikesh Mukherjee time, writer film, Jaideep Sahni done job! You see guys, I choice love film. But also means film full dialogues. Back forth back. If refraining creating non-loud Sikh character, done job well! It's shame good enough. And task creating believable office-going characters seems like mild achievement. Obviously none would come actors didn't jobs weren't given direction. You want idealistic protagonist stick guns want succeed too. But, know day age asking impossible, want realistic film too. And make demand hopes risen due perfect casting. From technician Mishraji (Mukesh Bhatt) Giri despite uneven Hyderabadi accent (or Telangana now? :) ). You want hug all. And course want beat brat boss, Mr. Suri. So fresh cast, despite detailed searches net, I can't figure character played whom. The search on, meanwhile, dear readers, know, drop line. But that, go catch sales-guy achieves targets! He's selling product service. He's selling value system. Remember, selling, preaching. So might buy it. You know want to.
