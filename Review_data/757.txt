From love first sight till-death-do-us-part style, crazy love via banter misunderstandings relationship goes - Ram-Leela all, gorgeous frames, amongst lots song dance. That also makes predictable, long over-dramatized. For better part first half Ram-Leela completely engaging. The set-up intriguing, language brash earthy, characters draw interest course pretty. What also happens hand-in-hand though everything little overdone. For example, songs breathtakingly beautiful go little long; I actually laughed loud innuendo stretched kill joke; similarly characters, least side characters, get little repetitive. The two central characters though keep hooked - first hour. It difficult say whether vivacious performances, strong-minded characters, chemistry lead pair look jaw-droppingly beautiful, colorful costumes lack thereof. Or could soaking atmosphere. Or - hooked. Even much overlook implausibility all. You enter fairytale, alright. The side characters too, hold terms performances screen space given. Gulshan Devaiah Richa Chadda nicely layered characters - especially considering part large canvas many small characters share space with. Similarly, given uni-dimensional Supriya Pathak's character is, pretty decent job instilling fear. Ranveer Singh Deepika Padukone oozing oomph. At time, presence that. The pulsating sexual tension isn't regular feature Hindi films. Ranveer Singh creating quite space romantic lead hero. Deepika Padukone too, looks prettier day also engages performer. After first hour though, impact film began, wait something better happen. Unfortunately, film pretty much takes route predicted end first hour. Other overall love angle, story tries touch upon current social issue. But, comes nowhere doesn't get much attention main scheme things, later. It thus, ends looking like afterthought. Sure, twists sit to, impact fizzles out, either long-drawn melo-dramatized slow motion. These things slow proceedings towards climax know about. There's loads violence gory. While become one shooting shooting one, couple chase sequences I really liked - despite slow-motion. The sound design choreography slick. In fact, frame picture perfect, lighting frame looks divine. But, least expect Sanjay Leela Bhansali film, right? And I watch almost film atmosphere. Even though, goes masala time, barely clad men, women backless blouses conservative set-up, item number all! If too, might mind Ram-Leela. Once, way.
