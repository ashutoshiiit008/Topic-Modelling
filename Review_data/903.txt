That Girl In Yellow Boots isn't film enjoy. It's dark forthright film, making uncomfortable watch. It makes care protagonist don't want bad things happen even see make go horrible actions. You feel worse goes moral evils bribery sexual acts, matter-of-fact manner. (which also means, don't watch film either kids parents!) Anyway, see immorality things refuses do. She's street-smart; found way around mean-machine Mumbai even though she's UK. And yet know she's fragile cold stare. The writer dug deep one character, know her. And beauty actor writer story. Kalki Koechlin knows character Ruth well, takes time convincing us story needs heard. It also needs heard taboo subject approaches. A topic needs talked liberally, wrapped covers making victim feel guilty. In fact, Ruth's family talked it, wouldn't film. (Funny this, I can't talk here, I'll giving movie away :)) About ninety hundred minutes spent Ruth, trying find father. And yet, don't get bored. That's bunch characters Ruth encounters, tolerates gets past. Almost telling us, life lessons learning make stronger person. And somehow worth it. From Chitiappa Gauda (Gulshan Devaiya) much-needed comic relief form goon Prashant, Ruth's drug-dealer boyfriend (Prashant Prakash). Amidst mix common not-so-normal characters played new actors reassuring presence father figure familiar face Naseeruddin Shah. Of course, fact I remember character Naseeruddin Shah tiny failure. But, folly gets overwhelming. Sure, couple times repetitiveness begins get you. But exact time, character film tells annoying character. Bottom line film engages throughout. The dialogue smart delivery one perfect. I also like characters unfold. We come know things interact. I'm sure directors would chosen voiceover route. This kind Anurag Kashyap film used to. That Girl In Yellow Boots subtler calmer. He's rushing make point he's sure he'll get another chance make it. His angst society wouldn't allow kind films made settled bit. And added overall package film is. That doesn't mean doesn't shock like trademark Anurag Kashyap film. The "shock therapy" could held him, facts vermin society cannot told without shocking. Even though I guessed climax, one passing line Ruth says somewhere middle film, climax shook bit. It could I didn't want Ruth's story ended. An issue close-to-heart, cold portrayal world, straightforward as-is style made uncomfortable, big plus film intention. Yet, unlike Anurag Kashyap films I'd urge try even type, I won't able recommend That Girl In Yellow Boots. Because ironically, That Girl In Yellow Boots looking happy endings.
