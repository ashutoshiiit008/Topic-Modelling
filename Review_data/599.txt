The smartest move makers Mama putting ‘Guillermo Del Toro presents’ big, bold letters posters film. That enough draw fans supernatural genre cinephiles general theatres. Directed Andrés Muschietti, Mama old-fashioned horror film works spite familiar tropes, cold, stark feel film, story connects viewer primal level. I must confess right I’ve never scared watching horror film, time different. For me, Mama well-shot, moody engaging story maternal instinct transcends rational human thought. So I say Mama works ‘horror’ film, I’m basing opinion based gasps nervous laughter I heard co-audience theater, grown man next hands ears head buried shoulder woman sitting next him. A brief prologue introduces us Jeffrey, depressed man who, murdering wife, kidnaps two young daughters disappears mysterious circumstances. Cut five years later, two men hired Jeffrey’s brother, Lucas (who never gave hope finding two nieces again) finally find two girls tucked away abandoned cabin. Except girls less human beast-like, prolonged isolation mankind. Lucas girlfriend Annabel take girls in, hoping rehabilitate help Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss, psychiatrist. Things, course, don’t go planned Lucas Annabel. Right outset, mood film sucks in. The washed out, sepia tone film opens, gradually becoming gray film progresses, end, is, intents purposes, black – film creates atmosphere hard taken by. Expectedly, film ample shots shadows suddenly crossing field vision, startling use dark parts frame deliver chills, sharp cuts accompanied screeching background score shock – familiar turf who've experience horror cinema. Little girls, course, make excellent horror film subjects movie two – enough keep audience tenterhooks film. If technique film aids creating tense, chilling mood, Jessica Chastain’s performance Annabel creates emotional connect film like really needs. From bass guitarist rock band reluctant mother, performance makes transformation character believable, film’s best moments involve supernatural force film. However, seemingly crisp 100-minute runtime film actually tad long good. The strength horror film really lies portions nothing actually happening. It anticipation something happening almost always contributes scaring daylights audience. Mama works best supernatural figure isn’t fully revealed. However audience actually sees figure entirety, fear element sucked out. Proceedings eventually get tad repetitive, climax lacks kind tension would leave audience nerve-wracking high. (Yes, man next took fingers ears last fifteen minutes.) Also, I personally felt supernatural figure film scary enough, looks obviously computer-generated. Still, Mama works primarily moments anticipation film almost always audience chewing away fingernails. Mama actually kind film would fun watch packed cinema hall, something part large group flinches, jerks gasps time. While I wasn’t part audience reacted physically audibly show, I still enjoyed occasional spooky startle. Occasionally turning right watch grown man behave like baby icing cake.
