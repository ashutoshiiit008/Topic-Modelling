Just seeing Amol Palekar Sharmila Tagore hoarding together enough make want give one try. Samaantar quite, serene experience. It puts screen struggle responsible individual his/her personal aspirations. However, contrary expectations, intense debates match intense looks lead pair's faces promo material. A couple interesting points raised romance life-death. But, despite arc story narration seems flat. One huge compromises story make justify lead pair's feelings sacrifices made youth.

Sharmila Tagore's quite composition Shama communicates much verbose Amol Palekar's Keshav. Each perfect place. These two get completely involved. Amazing since man come back acting 30 years.
