Tezz makes brain go numb - loud action sequences accompany shoddy VFX, inane dialogue, content mind-bogglingly dim-witted. An illegal immigrant gets offended thrown UK comes back threaten, takes along illegal immigrants blow couple trains make demands government!? And hope backstory going make audience see justification behind actions "anti-hero"?! Even part audience, like me, thinks Aakash Rana (Ajay Devgan) villain anti-hero, he's loathsome enough make Tezz watchable. And huge disappointment villains aren't absolutely nasty potential make interesting characters. But here, Aakash seems misguided writers, assuming writers involved project. Yep! Beginning complain plot holes implies coherent plot. All I know is, I start filling 'didn't work' section notepad opening sequence film, next two hours pretty much written off. While film less one chase sequence - well-choreographed, others interrupted childish graphics special effects - wish text screen said 'The End' reads 'Interval'. None main characters roles require much emoting even speaking - latter good thing. Especially, potential speakers likes Kangna Ranaut made cringe diction even two lines had. Actually both, Sameera Reddy, barely called "lead" characters. Of lot, fact Boman Irani followed Anil Kapoor get screen space allows least expressions. But, awful lines, wish hadn't taken film first place. Then songs place even someone somewhere tried justify convoluted reason. Mallika Sherawat's 'laila' must one worst choreographed picturised item numbers recent times. Tezz gives weird sense disappointment - kind get even weren't expecting anything half-decent begin with.
