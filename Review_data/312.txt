It striking FALTU makes aware climb Maslow's need pyramid. Gone days worrying roti, kapda aur makaan. We looking generation wants trained entertainers. And makes FALTU contemporary. Alas! The methodology used convincing thus along jokes laugh writers' naivet√©. It soon fashionable make film thoroughly flawed educational system. And isn't good thing don't expect profound workable solutions films? FALTU doesn't either. But, I like basic concept way director, Remo tried execute it. If little funnier eventually is, lines, performances. There certainly couple hilarious, laugh-out-loud scenes. And times might able control smile silliness situation. But, movie sets talk social issues, needs leave lasting impression whatever means possible. Humor works times, one, doesn't. Especially, give away 2-3 main punch jokes trailer. One reason course, supposedly funny lines make laugh, though intention clear. As side, also get lectures "right way" encourage kids aren't academically bright. Also, though writing tries hard make characters behave differently other, end without outstandingly distinguishing factors. The reason glaring face inadequate loudish performances. If FALTU little less Uday-Chopra look alike. I mean ok one looks like other, silly grin face. It doesn't allow go beyond look might acting. Sure Puja Gupta saving grace department. Yeah, despite Riteish Deshmukh Arshad Warsi - two best terms comic timing. Again, I'd put blame superfluous writing. There attention paid characters. Despite though, basic plot tries best remain true theme spirit film. The bunch controlling parents new concept way many us might grown up. To see screen gives us sense camaraderie even. You hear entire generation shouting "LET GO!" son says father. AND there's last dance climax (no, closing credits, one part actual film). I could watch bumped rating bit one last masterpiece.
