Hindi movies repetitive predictable. And yet manage surprise you. Knock actually managed get awful performance Irrfan Khan. Yep! Disheartening, no? At first, I thought ridiculous hairstyle I aren't able distract from. But, passing minutes difficult let haywire curls shoulder blame. While watching Irrfan Khan deteriorate, Sanjay Dutt's usual stylish, confident, goon act seemed like award-winner. Kangna Ranaut? Oh, mean shrieks, weird dialogue delivery mechanism aka pout? I wanted go back drugged out, mentally ill characters. In fact, looks like missing days too. She tried pull one looks off, scene she's supposed scared. After much Sushant Singh's cool atitude pull off? Also, one main characters, phone booth way lavish portray character's internal struggle claustrophobia feels person is. Despite this, I'd say Knock Out far better written average thriller. With fiction, still realm reality within story should/or least try stay. The way around this, ofcourse spread acceptability sphere wide, almost anything possible within. So, whole world Sanjay Dutt's disposal. By definition, act well planned, cannot question capabilities ready almost anything. When cannot question character's capacities, left bare bone plot. Knock strong-ish hold one till gave way mother clich√©'s children. The spiels wouldn't stop ace it, one character actually say, "I haven't called preach!". Yeah, right! Yet, Knock covers lot ground. It touches upon cool aloofness CCD-generation towards bomb-blasts everyday happenings, till something completely ordinary happens - like suited-guy ridiculous dance middle road. It goes show self-centered roles - whether news reporter police officer. We want keep control, irrespective life-and-death situation hand - long ours. This becomes clearer direct question posed "my career vs. nation's future" The character chooses latter go 'baah!' Which I realized truly self-absorbed cannot even accept fictional characters giving personal aspirations. Yet, towards end I thinking. So, if, happens film actually comes true? What country it? How citizens hold new people in-charge accountable? Now, movie made think one bit topic it's about, done something right, even teeny-weeny bit.
