For films like Chennai Express, reviews futile, I accept. Fans star/director/genre going watch film come may. The rest us couldn't bothered reading review, let alone watching it. Sympathies latter group "loved" ones former group drag theater kicking screaming. May 142 minutes rest peace, not. In sense, Chennai Express delivers exactly expected - - histrionics Shah Rukh Khan; - beauty gorgeousness Deepika Padukone; - loads loads buffoonery; - bold, bright, solid colored costumes, art-work props; - slapsticky dialogue trots around self-importantly; - peppy song dance. As complete Rohit Shetty film is. Well, sans Ajay Devgn. So, don't cool personality bring calm least break over-the-top state affairs. Even otherwise, Shah Rukh Khan's facial contortions (except one romantic twinkle eyes) remind origins race. Here, actually supposed make laugh monkey business. Yet, despite apathy towards tomfoolery, one scene got goose bumps. Of course, little late. It doesn't help jokes predictable every SMS joke, self-referencing SRK one-liners predictable too! For rest dialogue left emotional/philosophical lines sound like picked book quotes. What could funny happened once, either repeats goes long kill whatever little joy started with. You wonder then, whether complain half film Tamil. I clue heavy mockery Tamilians wear, speak, eat, eat offensive. But I didn't find good taste. The one trying add grace everything else, Deepika Padukone. Since, I don't know diction right not, I say didn't look convincing. Maybe, apparent trying really hard. Through character, attempt made send message across men nation. But again, setting way topic length film suddenly become particular social issue. All thank Rohit Shetty small mercies - least tried make film something, little less random. After gratitude then, come feeling happy wasn't worse expected. And least, crowd around you, people film made good time.
