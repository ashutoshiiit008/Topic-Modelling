"dhik-chak--dhik-chak-dhum-dhum". What warm welcome! That's background score using extra energy. Well-accompanied well-endowed cleavage. No - isn't connection. That’s stares face word go. The interesting editing used beginning establish characters makes ignore loud score - least bit. Unfortunately though, story pretty much predictable thus becomes chore watch. Everything seems half-baked cases completely uncooked. Shreyas Talpade looks good seemed bit playing mature character. Then again, might intentional. Udita Goswami plays character constantly duress underdressed. So can’t really blame singular expression wears movie. Tusshar Kapoor - can't blame either. He miscast. Look him! Obsessed lover? Doesn't work all! As cases, script deal breaker here. It neither coherent, researched, got wrong far plot points concerned. "slish-slash-whiplash". The background score still it. And flesh show. Towards end, head spinning. One would think I trying blame music, I not. It’s multiple supposed "twists" get annoyingly weary one-kilo brain. So much begin suspecting premise whole plot. I completely understand film-makers believe genre required loud music. I glad though didn't think camerawork. That slick editing put together made parts really interesting, visually. Especially titles couple songs. While music alright, lyrics "ke bin tere" nice. "tak-tada-tak-bluck-bluck". They won't let go...till last shot. I admit bit unfair pick background score, almost every department needed lot work re-work.
