thoda pyaar thoda magic crash course moral science second graders below. And I'm pretty sure target audience going thoroughly enjoy lesson song dance, cartoons naughtiness. So, parents sit happy, kids taught animal rights, civic sense, love war, forgiveness, importance bonding blood relations, graceful winner loser, religious tolerance little two hours. And I'm pretty sure must couple I missed on. You know means adults, right? One hell sappy movie! Over-idealistic hilt, indigestibly sweet. I doubt even songs underwater shots bikini-clad Ameesha Patel compensate that. In fact, that's high price pay tolerating shrill character plays. I know-I know, that's character demands, yada, yada. But, hurts watch excuse used Saif Ali Khan. He wears one sullen look throughout movie despite capable varied range expressions. True, character somber. But, man couldn't cry make feel emotional scenes. Of course, blame equally apportioned talent way character develops. The transformation aloofness bonding, long silences talking heart little quick. Is Rani Mukherjee really look feel almost movies? Itâ€™s like isn't trying different roles. Yet, somehow today watching movie I got feeling "been there, seen that". Maybe something extra layer make-up find necessary apply make look fairer. Anyhow, something amiss everyone involved felt like going motions. Also, watching movie today, I suddenly realized kids idolize RV Shona, characters Saif Ali Khan Rani Mukherjee play Ta Ra Rum Pum. I visualize idolizing Ranbir Geeta watching one. Does mean grow going say, "we grew watching Saif Rani movies kids like us" like say today, "we grew watching Al Pacino Amitabh Bachchan made us wanna like them." Scary, eh? If that's onus carry, get better this, capable it. I digress. Coming back movie hand, dialogues situations pretty plain given it's supposed four really naughty kids. And children enacting roles super-adorable either. In way it's nice see regular kids playing regular kids. And it's better nothing compared old tricks kids pull harass adults. But also means nothing really exciting happening. Although tributes given various movies yesteryears cute. Also, usual melodious lively number Kunal Kohli movies missing here. Although I loved way visualized. The choreography bare minimum overall effect used charming. The main problem though touch lot cinema - Indian foreign - compared generations us ever were. So, obviously kind exposure, would really difficult spot something 'new' terms animation special effects. The onus completely lies creatively utilizing effects. And thoda pyaar thoda magic team manages put together well. Yeah, things appear disappear, inanimate stuff dance, counts, works pretty well here. The question remains - don't movies kids adults enjoy together?
