With title like "Hridaynath" (‘Ruler Heart’, apparently) kind poster film had, expectations one would walking watch film would fairly obvious. The first minutes film would cemented expectations. A soliloquy film's lead actor, Jackie Shroff, backdrop sunset along Konkan coast, talking disconnect matters heart mind; touching, tad dramatic, revelation schoolteacher village retire 40 years selfless service generations students; things indeed set nicely sensitive story middle aged man cusp new phase life. Alas, film go downhill faster professional skier, 'how' truly boggle audiences' mind. The tragedy I can't talk asinine plot twist intermission threw one particularly petulant audience member behind hyperventilating rant evils choosing watch film based promos. It isn't absurdity plot rankles though. The entire setup resolution flawed excess them. One whole half spent repeatedly hammering character traits protagonist audiences’ head, half spent deconstructing it, sense. Also, considerable noteworthy effort clearly gone making film look like decent production values, fact remains lack budget shows quite often. If one put gun head however, ask point least one positive drawn film, would Jackie Shroff. The man quite clearly fun, spite labored Marathi, one clearly see hard work gone dubbing film. And Rangeela fan wouldn't smile sight Jackie Shroff Urmila Matondkar together screen, even situation plain ridiculous? If ever movie whose plot deserved given away, would undoubtedly Hridaynath; discussing film would infinitely fun film itself. However, since I truly believe ideology behind wogma, I'd like say unless like Parinda much I grown awe Jackie Shroff's swagger films like Tridev, Hridaynath safely avoided without iota doubt.
