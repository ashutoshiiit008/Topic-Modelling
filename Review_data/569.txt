Friends forever maybe not. Or maybe become best friends except thin line still keeps apart. Does human mean taking care mean giving one all? Can human selfish selfless? Both nauseating way? Well, takes kinds make world. And I guess makes interesting place live albeit insane. Yes. A Vipul Amrutlal Shah film made think beyond going on, screen. And is, despite quintessential Hindi film touches it. That's ALSO broader non-standard pleasantly surprising strokes. Example, there's one event line transforms good evil vice versa, character written way transition smooth. Another stroke, I thought made entire film worth while, Arjun's (Ajay Devgn's) character. His traits established, passion drives goal maybe even insanity. Whether achieves goal and/or insanity go watch. And that's beauty. The film maintains dark-ish atmosphere know anything could happen it's equally likely film won't end popular note. And keeps interest alive. Ajay, course, makes maintains serious ambience film. The twitches way eyes move disclose what's Arjun's mind missed. But, it's mainstream Hindi film keeps reminding that. For instance, almost characters pretty much flat. Including Manu (Salman Khan) Priya (Asin). And actors didn't much whatever little scope characters either. Salman Khan usual stuff. His comic timing best really funny lines given him. It's amazing man thing still fans cheering hooting through. Though one dashes facial muscle movement there. In script much male protagonist, itâ€™s shame lead woman etchily sketched. She could involved. She could least disappeared one crucial plot points film! The show-down bit much swallow. And climax came way quickly abrupt. Yes, I'm still complaining length. It's sad film long still find something amiss. Whatever drawbacks film terms story dialogues improvement, entertainment-quotient two departments (of Vipul Shah film) came pleasant surprise. And aesthetics terms cinematography sound design. Maybe losing Akshay Kumar might done trick. Ok, sorry, couldn't resist unwarranted dig. It's film makes want hero win anti-hero lose. You flinch latter punished want reach tell it's ok. This one also strong hard work vs. talent+charisma debate backdrop. But drama goes tad long. Long enough notice holes departments. And lose us.
