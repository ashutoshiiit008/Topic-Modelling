‘Sequels worse originals’ – clichéd statement. And Little Fockers. The story line filled old fight two patriarchs family culture like. Egos clash, makes life hard Greg Focker family. The miscommunication unbending attitudes relationship takes toll family. But supposedly funny way. So even us can’t identify situations, definitely identify reactions. There little Little Fockers movie, though present time. The twins, Samantha (played Daisy Tahan) Henry (Colin Baiocchi), don’t look like twins justice smart-kid silly-kid roles respectively. And though film adults problems, director managed drag kids occasions. Acting generally mediocre. Ben Stiller good, fed father-in-law trying bully him. He Robert De Niro put good duet given situations. I expecting much screen time Dustin Hoffman Barbra Steisand, looks like Dustin Hoffman didn’t like script accepted shoot 6 scenes. Well, movie I feel right. Jessica Alba obviously looks great – fan may want catch film. Some jokes good, though also irritating old ones. The best part slight flavor The Godfather Jaws. Just right amount reference given reassured spoof, yet enough make smile remembering classics. Although, one uninteresting closing scenes ever. I mean, ending good note bad note one thing. But end almost bores audience, sense make? The film certainly misses hilarious situations Meet The Parents even Meet The Fockers had. So try compare want laugh. Catch TV really options. An empty mind might help getting frustration ‘why earth make film?!’
