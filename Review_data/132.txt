First things first (oh I hate phrase but, important is), T bhabhi, please don't read this, go enjoy film. That goes Big B lovers. I one too, I know much want like Bbuddah Hoga tera baap. Reviewers like us come go, want this, films. But persona like Amitabh Bachchan... Bbuddah Hoga tera baap attempt pay tribute him. Because justifiable words three dots, film underwhelming. For example, songs caught on, knew AB Sr. going groove them. I don't know expecting, something surpass cool act Jumma Chumma, maybe? That's say doesn't look suave white orange, printed scarf. Or moves aren't charming were, back then. But then, see both, writer/director's passion devotion man whose films grew with. You see he's hurt, idol sidelined roles say, "ol' man, passed prime." Even age-appropriate. He wants revive charisma, maybe, one last time. That I respect. It's like film showcases Amitabh Bachchan Amitabh Bachchan nothing more. Considering film blatant "star-centric" film, Bbuddah Hoga tera baap reasonably fleshed story. The characters might deeply thought out, motivations clear. There nuances keep film contemporary. Like honesty morals always deteriorated. He's moralistic he's Amitabh Bachchan But alongside references/tributes films 70s. The parents hate love stories; hero continues hero despite taking 3-4 bullets chest; gratuitous song; girl plays hard get. Some things work, don't. Raveena Tandon comic relief annoying beyond measure, example. Then again, simple things give joy aren't there. Unlike producers know, don't one making presence felt now-mandatory end credit "item" song. When songs actually enough potential job. It's film him, him, all. I liked Bbuddah Hoga tera baap Amitabh Bachcan. In vague way, I get Salmania. But I still use vague because, Ajooba Toofan, I'd hated it. Thank you, Mr. Writer, leaving story there. But, I know know, nothing justice Amitabh Bachchan symbolizes least three generations. Maybe it's time tap much he's capable of. For attempt, though, I applaud you, I identify enthusiastic affection. So, goes attempt tribute. I could sit one place look him, staring distance, humming 'Haal-e-dil' hour half more. When romanticizes Bombay, combines two loves, delight brings, makes nostalgic affair city. When flirts girls less half age, makes cringe. Maybe I see baap him. But soon enough, I forget I'm seeing him, I see good ol' Viju charming way - girls, women, police, villains, all. Except, can't reach woman life. In fleeting moment, pain evident, arrogance, helplessness resignation. When kicks villain's butt 65+ year-old muscles move really complicated action choreography - without help camera trick editor - I......oops, sorry, didn't mean call bbuddah! Can I get away with, "Sir, I wanted see more, much much more"
