Most underworld-crime based films less circle around "vanity vengeance". With audience mostly doesn't belong world characters film come, story writers pretty much don't choice. And yet, situation writers made going interesting possible. Building characters along way. Creating situations unrest regular intervals. The pre-requisite crime-based action film swift pace one thing Baabarr doesn't lack. There's always something happening one situation leads another clean clear flow. And flow "boom-dishum-bang-dhickyau". The gun-mania won't take rest. As little boy found new toy. I'm easily disturbed violence, Baabarr Hindi cinema takes new level. There one scene I actually felt sick stomach. And I say count number non-violent scenes fingers. And even scenes dialogue violence took place going take place. Yet, it's like characters haven't worked upon. Each type characters traits stay consistent comply boundaries set them. Thus adding believability. They given decent dialogues too. Though characters, time, either scare get scared, there's much wrong acting department. Except maybe Mithun Chakroborty can't seem keep actor's style character. Also grainy texture adds "realistic" feel film. The handheld, jerky camera put use almost continuously, chaos tension throughout movie too. One refreshing aspect backdrop neither Mumbai Hindi cinema's favorite Punjab. They've also tucked tributes presumed inspirations like The Godfather Satya. But, would shock didn't that. We see 5, maybe even 10 films, based underworld concept every year. The storyline much different. The basis watching one another could something different tried build-up towards climax. Baabar couple vexing situations that's it. And besides excessive gore isn't much variant crime-related fields.
