The "Underworld meets terrorism" tagline clearly seems like marketing ploy get initial crowds theater. Because Contract much terrorism say, RGV ki Aag Sholay. (I promise last time I mention RGV ki aag I review RGV product!) Having said that, you're game another vengeance-ridden protagonist "shoot sight" order director, one it. The story fairly well-written characters border-line caricatures non-standard enough grab attention. First things first, usual, I couldn’t handle random "see nostril hair" super-tight close-ups. My complaint like always, randomness actual close-ups. I must say though, scenes could easily used standard over-the-shoulder editing, instead, close-ups mid-shots interspersed shots characters frame. I'm saying path-breaking, saying it’s breath fresh air extensive "blackhead coverage". Of departments film-making, Contract, casting fascinated most. Many movies make wonder decisions. What went writer's head? What interaction cinematographer director shot? Contractmade very, curious casting process. What must auditions like? How pick actor absolutely suit character? So many them, new faces none looked place. Now, importance character whole scheme things debated, actors chosen well almost one justice role given them. Some characters over-ridden stereotypes set apart them. For example, main lead played Adhvik Mahajan (Aman) wooden, sullen look one thought another way portraying peace-loving guy hardened vagaries life. Not mention Adhvik's voice complete turn down. For instance, Prasad Purandhare looked sinister opening shots cop trying convince Aman joining ploy get terrorists. So much I wouldn't surprised behind havoc Aman's life first place. The sight loud characters get nerves crawling skin. So, I think it’s huge compliment I manage tolerate movie, fact enjoy company first couple times screen. While credit go Upendra Limaye Amruta Subhash played loud Goonga louder wife, equally shared way characters written things made even though focus camera. There certain rawness way things handled writing sub-plots too. I'm sure always wondered protagonist, kill villain, chatted first? You'll know watch Contract. Because way looks easy true. But, deserve points trying something different. While let us see screen gritty needs be, don't see implied effect nerves too. Then maybe, image wife-beater create head blind visuals twist lyrics innocent rhyme, 'twinkle twinkle', hits you. The latter works child's voice used. Unfortunately, cannot said creativity writing broader plot. It decent watch ultimately there's nothing new story. Ram Gopal Varma blog mentions, Somebody asked Contract trilogy. I wouldn’t say that, trilogy sounds like finale intent make hundredology gangster films. I guess that's why, he's touched upon terrorism angle that's claimed pervade underworld. After 97 movies go, what's rush?
