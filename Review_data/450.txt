Acclaimed playwright theatre director, Ratnakar Matkari makes feature film debut age 74 film Investment, premiered 14th Mumbai Film Festival, India Gold category Indian premieres competition. A film largely remains theatrical way characters scenes treated, I often found wondering exactly selection panel saw film shortlist finalist competition. The film tells story Ashish Prachi, young couple lofty ambitions speeding Maslow's hierarchy needs even cost losing grounding values. They even higher ambitions adolescent boy Sohel, hope groom nurture politician future. Sohel's paternal grandmother tries best instill values child, absolute brat, begins see world everything much know, seems fighting losing battle. With parents spoiling child endlessly, along aspirations moving higher class society, incident lives shakes roots. There isn't doubt fact Ratnakar Matkari's intentions noble. We indeed live world material worth social circles carry far weight one's innate character. Money buy almost anything, exposure today's children explosion media information around them, real threat not-too-distant future, society cease believe concepts right wrong. Ratnakar Matkari dealt issues film, characters Ashish, Prachi Sohel. The film's undoing lies fact treated subtlety sledgehammer audience's head. Ashish 'cool' dad who, Prachi tells mother-in-law film, son's friend father, 'norm' society today. Prachi gloriously theatrical executing unashamed ambitions, planning family's rise society machinations Shakespearean manipulator. Sohel annoying brat way parents times, getting fond looks expensive gifts unbearably obnoxious behaviour. These characters painted broad strokes almost stand caricatures. In spite competent cast names like Tushar Dalvi Sulbha Deshpande, performances cast over-the-top, contributes film seeming even theatrical. For story succeed cinematically, needed far subtle approach. The characters, doubt rooted real, end seeming unreal treatment. Also, even technically, camerawork makes seem like filmed play anything else. The screenplay rather loose begins bordering inane towards latter half film. Investment thus ends little like Madhur Bhandarkar film albeit cleaner, relevant subject. It might work weekend afternoon TV watch subscribe rather strong stereotypes characters film might even enjoy it. But most, film's extremes make tedious watch.
