Christopher Nolan really knows play minds. He sparked whole new world ideas heads The Dark Knight 2008, course, field day Inception, pay enough attention, you’ll realize isn’t trying impress us The Dark Knight Rises. Nor merely telling story (or closing one, case). As sensible filmmaker storyteller, he’s left best (read: eccentric, layered mind-boggling) parts behind, peak trilogy, The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises finale be; all-encompassing yet mysterious enough hold one’s intrigue, mature, experimental it’s treatment characters individual scenes builds spectacularly fulfilling, almost calming climax end. The film begins near-dystopian Gotham, shattered Bruce Wayne sign Batman, 8 years since tragic night took blame Harvey Dent’s wayward crimes. By now, Gotham taken economical global hit (very well merged real-life crises) Bruce Wayne shows sign returning city’s “masked vigilante”. The slowly panned first half establishes it’s characters scenario meticulous detail. This could impatient viewer's grudge film, Nolan gives enough bite impending explosion second half. We introduced Bane (Tom Hardy), muscular masked terrorist leader intends destroying Gotham City. While Hardy’s personality Bane doesn’t match sinister villains previous films (and it’s safe say Ledger’s Joker hard match to), sheer gritty look enough instill fear. Here mask trick; often can’t understand he’s saying you’re half expecting to, moment, lose temper tear everything pieces. His brute demeanor convinces break Batman apart, coupled looming fear classic villains made of. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) jewel thief robs survival, several heated interactions Batman. Tradionally, she’s known Bane’s aid, film follows trajectory. Hathaway strong, witty plays part Catwoman (although never called that) much panache. Marion Cotillard plays millionaire Miranda Tate part Wayne Enterprises board, means support Batman encourages stand responsibility. Joseph Gordon-Levitt John Blake, young police officer symbol voices audience. Through film keep expecting Batman rise, never lose faith him, Gordon-Levitt’s character recreates faith film continuously needs fall back on. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman Gary Oldman resume characters Alfred, Fox Gordon respectively. All familiar territory; predictable build Bane’s terrorist plans audience seen first two films, know what’s store us. However, Batman rises film starts rolling action, every moment witness filled baggage 7 years 2 films, Nolan presents every moment victoriously. He gives want see, triumphs needs triumphed, slashes needs burn. And therefore, unlike The Dark Knight (and intention compare films reception them), film doesn’t knock ground feat, manages restore back place sense stability. The Dark Knight Rises mature story telling; closes ends also leaves tiny mischievous slit open. It barrage inspiring dialogue superhero morals soaked action-heavy sequences visually epic (kudos cinematographer Wally Pfister Hans Zimmer audio-visual treat). Essentially, film gives everything would need finale. You might wanted unexpected craziness edge seat moments (the expectations film riding almost unreal). However, The Dark Knight Rises need viewer (and follower trilogy), fluctuating closure: one that’s classic mature, yet satisfies need surprised. And recognizing executing that, take bow Nolan.
