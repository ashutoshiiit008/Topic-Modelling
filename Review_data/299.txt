I love film shows covered promos first minutes film. That means haven’t given away much I lot new stuff look forward to. But, course, I shouldn’t begun hope twists Ek Tha Tiger clear mile away. The rest story another love story, once, masked guise feuding nations, instead feuding families. The ‘message’ international peace. Thankfully, message isn’t drilled preachy dialogue. Yet, dialogue isn’t one used Salman film - oozing style filminess. Not makes dialogue subtle likeable. It plain lines trying best make impact. Unsuccessfully. This failure nothing Salman Khan’s usual lack emotion dialogue. Nor anything Katrina’s reversion lifeless dialogue delivery (which sad watch.) The writing doesn’t carry kind weight charm. Every time, think might decent ‘moment’ coming up, let something ordinary. The heart vs. brain dilemma even interesting crossroads India Pakistan’s intelligence agencies find thin thread hook interest on. But hey, need two best-looking people industry filling every frame screen. Interestingly, Ek Tha Tiger, unlike Salman films even action films, gives lead lady lot play lot screen time. A welcome change, however wasted might rendered Katrina Kaif’s emotionless, heavily made up, facial muscles - almost directed match Salman’s attempt acting. The songs little Salman them. They look sound like regular masala flick. Except ‘mashaallah’ wait end credits. The question remains – attempted coherent story didn’t intend make anything substantial, impactful entertaining it? Or simply stuck Salman Khan fans enjoy best - mindless action. The action less lackluster, except chase sequence climax. Seeing woman Hindi film cat-like moves entertaining, alright. But, course, go ahead spoil awful use looks like green screen shoddy post-production work. Ek Tha Tiger underwhelming experience neutral party like me. But going fact I heard almost dialogue none died whistles cheers tells would fan’s take too. Oh yes, ladies, get glimpse shirtless Salman Khan. Fine, gents too.
