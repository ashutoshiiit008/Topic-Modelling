Either I super-dumb donâ€™t understand things work life, moviemakers concept real people behave. For obvious reasons, I leaning towards latter interpretation. There way many questions crop remain unanswered. Why Ishwar (Amtiabh Bachchan) behave certain way 27 years make 180 degree turnaround behavior inappropriate juncture son's life? Why Aadi (Akshay Kumar) nondescript loser despite portrayed smart educated? Why asked feel sorry loser? While I it, Akshay Kumar made 27 year old? If movie relationships, shouldn't it, least, consistent characters involved relationships? And one easier, right? It one relationship, two characters need well-defined. Why anyone try excel art making Amitabh Bachchan overact, beyond me. I weep silently I see 'master comic timing' run around trying hit someone attempt make laugh. Director's actor fine, didn't feel one-bit silly saying lamest lines ever? What I deserve this? Oh sorry, isn't me, it? Okay, time snap "questions" mode. Boman Irani Rajpal Yadav comic relief serve purpose. They relieve drudgery bad-scripting forms main plot. But, type joke repeated often want relief jokes then. The overall plot bad premise movie all. But way details script handled outright shabby. E.g., amazing one crew ever seen pregnant woman treated behaves. No, pregnant women patients. They live active lifestyle. But, it's silly dance sway around air one point allowed single household chore next. The redeeming factor feel like slapping Aadi reality, means Akshay Kumar done job well. Of course, assumption character meant irritate you. And tears jerked every sensitively handled scene there. Nonetheless, futile attempt please crowds, decent story slaughtered soap opera-ish situations, ridiculously placed songs, jokes played skit format. And imprudence shall forgiven. Alrighty then, I week-long holiday. Yep! Vacationing meetu = review Friday. Until next week then, hasta-la-vista...
