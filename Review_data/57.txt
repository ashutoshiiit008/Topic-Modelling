Remember time Tim Burton movie surpassed expectations levels eccentricity (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands)? Well mourn days, doesn’t look like they’re coming back. Earlier year made Dark Shadows, quite dud compared earlier films, therefore I wasn’t expecting much co-production Timur Beckmambetov (of Wanted fame) Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. The title rather appalling, imagine United States’ 16th president closet Vampire Hunter. As haven’t already overload vampires. It’s biopic Abraham Lincoln scratch off. In version surrounding president (adapted bestselling novel written Seth Grahame-Smith), young Lincoln witnesses death mother result befriending African-American boy (a prevalent practice back day). The film moves onto Lincoln’s dual life – falls love Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) eventually enters politics, film focuses nocturnal activities adventures, consisting slasher, VFX heavy second half includes fictitious recreations American History well. While visuals quite gripping dark greys even darker crimsons, two halves film seem like separate movies. Not knowing aspect Lincoln’s life focus. The narrative disconnected seems focus visual appeal story hand. Benjamin Walker Lincoln pretty convincing, interrupted brief moments believe world Lincoln vampire hunter could exist. What helps elaborate set designs, costumes background score, allow suspension disbelief last while. You pulled however, confused narrative. The cuts enraged axe-wielding Lincoln historically relevant Lincoln haphazard. You’re kept toes tone film.t partly presents dark, bloody fantasy film partly biopic offering silly, almost comical alternatives American History. What must give Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter credit for, brilliantly shot. Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel uses frames dark-palette visuals merge well story. While one hand confused narrative doesn’t stay you, visuals technical bits film manage get attention, it’s reason watch it.
