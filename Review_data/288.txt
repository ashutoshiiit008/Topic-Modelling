One main differentiating factors short films leave punch line closure. Now lines necessarily work always. And thatâ€™s case 10 short films too. As titles depict, Dus Kahaniyaan kaleidoscope images, stories, narrative styles, issues. Almost ten stories loss - loss love blind faith friendship life itself. Each story theme thick vein sexual desire runs half them. I thought watching ten stories one go little exhausting. It like start, accelerate, reach high, shut-off, restart every ten minutes. I also thought order movies placed interesting. By third film anticipating punch seventh one pretty accurately guess twist. I think fewer movies wouldn't given audience chance guess would left better impact. (Yeah, would change title song bit.) Not mention wouldn't missed couple anyways (Lovedale Sex Beach). While I wouldn't take away marks concepts weird, didn't go well general tone collection. Then couple preachy (Zahir, Gubbare, Rice Plate). But Zahir keeps guessing till end, two saved boring brilliant acting. The veteran actors show it's done. Shabana Azmi, Naseeruddin Shah, Nana Patekar make forget status industry empathize characters play. Unfortunately, cannot said rest cast. While little average, rest barely mediocre. Be may, every story got involved established characters really well within 10 minutes assigned it. I found lighting camerawork pretty distracting couple stories. Matrimony absolutely unnecessary usage handheld camera bright background lights. On hand, effects created required mood High Highway Rise Fall. I liked narrative techniques last two well. As movie buff, couldn't asked better deal. 10-in-1. But, like equipment boasts "so many"-in-one, one jack trades master none. Parental Guidance: Not touched upon issues adult relationships, good amount sexual content quite bit violence.
