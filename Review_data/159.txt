It must indeed difficult task make film woman center. So difficult write stories around movies padded romantic track, couple songs on. Such shame. Even so, Bobby Jasoos tries. Not try make woman-based story work tries highlight life women India kept reaching potential. The question is, watch movie attempt making woman-centric film? One main reasons people looking forward Bobby Jasoos Vidya Balan product. One female stars command audience her. While, doesn't fail actor, Bobby aka Bilqis, hardly challenging enough her. However, isn't necessary take projects challenge actress. Sometimes subject needs attention. And deny attention necessary woman suppressed society, treated something needs passed father husband right age? This part writing done subtly indeed appealing. Unfortunately though, rest film spread thin many sub-plots. From lovers need detective ward-off proposals arriving arranged marriage route looking "flaws" prospective applicant fathers can't show love care directly child lovers can't feelings. The main point intrigue, mystery lame resolution provides thrill, even though tries tie two main threads film together. Top additional pressure funny commercially viable. Yes, commercially viable supposedly = dream sequences, matter random out-of-place are! I cannot think another reason existence song. Oh well. Other Vidya Balan, Ali Fazal brief moments work well. Arjan Bajwa screen presence even requires hold one expression. The rest cast share screen time well with. None good enough though given many stories Bobby Jasoos, film trying tell. Each distracting other, letting come point.
