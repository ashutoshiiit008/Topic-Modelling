I'm little weather. The annoying type unwell don't fever feverish. While walking Hum Tum Shabana I thought ache-able parts body already aching. Nope. Hum Tum Shabana made realize ears weren't aching beginning. Hum (Shreyas Talpade/Tusshar Kapoor), Tum (Tusshar Kapoor/Shreyas Talpade) Shabana (Minissha Lamba) loud surrounded louder people. The story goes weird (two guys falling love time woman first time see screen) berserk (wooing ridiculous fashion) utter rubbish (they want get proposing reasons find yourself, interested despite warning). Sometime berserk era, one scene ridiculous it's funny. "How could even come that?" kind funny. But save there's nothing film. Well, I guess I got one laugh I looking for. These times I wish I could borrow, NW1W (not worth one word) concept milliblog. Till then, here's attempt keeping short simple - Skip!
