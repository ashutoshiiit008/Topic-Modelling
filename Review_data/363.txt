Filmmakers looking avoid flak screenplay usually stay clear thriller genre, virtually impossible water-tight screenplay still make successfully thrilling mystery hooks audience start end. While I must confess I least expected to, Mohanlal-starrer Grandmaster, produced UTV, actually manages avoid pitfalls serial-killer-murder-mystery story. Powered surprisingly sharp script master-class underplaying lead character, Grandmaster, directed Unnikrishnan B, makes intriguing watch. Yes, share flaws writing, pace film rarely lets dwell them, diverting attention instead mental game chess protagonist playing, antagonist. Chandra Sekhar, played Mohanlal, top cop past prime, personal problem anything else. He heading newly-formed Metro Crime Stopper Cell, aimed preventing crime – department underperforming Chandra Sekhar’s weak leadership. A former National-level chess player, Chandra Sekhar’s jolted mental inertia writer mysterious letter proclaims intends play deadly game Chandra Sekhar, one intricately tied Chandra Sekhar’s personal life.

With murder, Chandra Sekhar sucked further, matches wits faceless opponent could important game chess life – one checkmate could fatal. What works Grandmaster character Chandra Sekhar. A man toast police department, broken lonely, spurred action maniacal serial killer. Add that, man named Mohanlal. There aren’t many actors use eyes way Mohanlal does. Perhaps blessed much natural screen presence superstar contemporaries, eyes separate craft rest pack. They rove screen slowly, partaking journey towards resolution cinematic character must invariably rewarded (or punished) with. Mohanlal plays Chandra Sekhar subtly competently would easy mistake performance one amongst hundreds given. But look closer see considered one finest actors country, personal favourite Indian actor distance.

There plot holes could avoided, situations screenplay tad farfetched. Also, beautiful Priyamani, playing Mohanlal’s ex-wife, competent actor, important side characters quite weak, crossing plain overacting - huge problem compounded subtly Mohanlal played character. It boils simple fact Grandmaster idiomatic edge seat throughout. The film paced right, twists screenplay don’t really jar, climactic revelation really worked me, though I must confess I’m sure many people would agree that.
