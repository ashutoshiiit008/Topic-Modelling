A contract killer first fist fight 5 reformed love reformer, lady, oblivious fact kill living. Add songs random spots, loud background score, louder dialogue delivery film disappoints every passing frame. Kill Dil doesn't start like though. The opening scenes actually perfectly quirky slick cinematography crisp editing. It makes sit take happening screen. Until, Govinda enters, 5-7 minutes film. I'm saying Govinda's entry things go downhill, coincidence moment trio Govinda-Ranveer Singh-Ali Zafar start singing one title songs, wonder come sudden drop slapstick zone? After that, quite time, I tried make sense absolute lameness story moving I caught trying hard like film owing first five minutes. Every while, odd dialogue brings smile. Ranveer Singh's overt attempt cute, charms intermittently too. But, overall plot, zero attempt building intrigue, unremarkable characters topped outlandish songs popping nowhere, kills attempt audience enjoy film. For instance, Parineeti Chopra's character, Disha exists. She zero role play others behaving credit discredit goes Disha. Similarly, Tutu (Ali Zafar) protagonist, Dev's (Ranveer Singh) best friend, alter ego too, Tutu comes across incidental. Dev transformation seems arbitrary. Everything comes across something character situation film, ought done. His actions seem rather functional. Fortunately, performances keep things borderline tolerable. Govinda instills fear supposed end goes over-the-top drama gets over-bearing. Ali Zafar subdued lot. While refreshing watch non-chocolate-boy kind-of role, facial hair taking long way, performance soon boils old expressions. Ranveer Singh, like I said, charms character loosely written much it. The biggest waste talent Parineeti Chopra. Not role must sleep-walked also character inconsequential. You left one-liners strewn across potential bring smile. Some stylish cinematography background music first minutes resort tacky loud respectively end film. And end film pretty lame. Story lines like Kill Dil started losing charm 30+ years ago. I still able get fact Shaad Ali team, couldn't add one new angle make look like product next generation.
