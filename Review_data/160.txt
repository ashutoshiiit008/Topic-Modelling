Bodyguard's last half hour constantly reminded Chinese curse. May wish granted. I wished story Salman Khan film I got it. And much story stuffed 30 minutes I praying over. And refused, taunting me, "you wanted story, take story! And take more." Fortunately, maybe, lost Salman Khan fans. There least three action packed sequences slick moves. But somehow, lot credit taken camera editing "coolness". The rest time though, plays squeaky clean, Lovely Singh. The romance he's involved drags forever climax laugh heart - good way. And exact laughter brought every time Salman Khan breaks song. No rhyme, reason, since audience seen Salman Khan move muscles, let's edit song in. The supposedly comic scenes hand barely bring smile two. At times, bring cringes, especially "comic relief" side-kick comes screen. The one thing I found amusing Salman Khan played around hands woman. Otherwise, usually women thrown around brains helpless hands men. That doesn't mean Kareena Kapoor gets chance pathbreaking performance. She usual pretty-young-thing bit, gets little screen time otherwise accorded non-Salman-Khan Salman Khan film. Usually, film star film matters, I disclaimer review doesn't apply star's fans. But, I doubt even hardcore Salmaniacs enjoy Bodyguard either. The star however confident ever "I get away anything" attitude. A dialogue film goes, "tumhaari nazar mein tum hero, hamari nazar mein hum hero" (According you, hero. According me, I hero). Who would thought Salman Khan film could introspective.
