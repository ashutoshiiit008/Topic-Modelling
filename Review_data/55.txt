A weeks ago, caught trailer Abduction IMDB, friend happened bring something relevant notice. In essence, Abduction looked like stylized, self-serious version forgettable Salman Khan Starrer Tumko Na Bhool Payenge (TNBP). I wanted disagree secretly I found Taylor Lautner umm...good looking. But I couldn’t – reinforced I watched film. Abduction centered teenager, Nathan Harper (Lautner) figures he’s lied identity finds baby picture missing person’s website. Further investigation takes unexpected journey (predictable) revelations web complicated truths identity. He recurring dreams hidden identity (Reason comparing TNBP 1), seeks psychiatric help. Unfortunately doesn’t stop sunk messy whirlpool. Of course, sorts Lautner decided bare shirt (reason no. 2) take matters hands. Alongside high school crush, Karen Lowell (Lily Collins), embarks upon brave (allows heroism) little expedition makes repetitive, bordering hilarious visual experience. The film faults fundamentally inability evoke empathy lead teenager mess. Even manage move beyond relationship (or lack thereof) protagonist, jars Abduction fact everybody film, Director, John Singleton takes much seriously, real reason, I deduced. Singleton’s 2 Fast 2 Furious least true genre - fast paced, testosterone pumping, macho film. Writer Shawn Christensen written script convenience. Clues happen fall upon Nathan’s lap, happens exactly needs given moment time – there’s intellectual struggle part. The struggle see Lautner acting abilities. And know he’s hot- can’t breeze him, it? The film looks part though – monotone palate course, helps good looking protagonist, every account, Abduction fails. You know film bad, I recommend watch Twilight series instead.
