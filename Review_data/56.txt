Either way, even power, would one still really control destiny? Any time travel film makes ponder questions, Richard Curtis’s About Time actually built around them. 21-year-old Tim discovers ability travel time. Once Tim figures works, goes trying ensure life pans way wants it. Curtis, quite master mush, creates warm little world gawky Tim; world makes smile once, adorable characters genuinely witty moments involving Tim people life; father (an adequately charming Bill Nighy); Mary, woman loves (a slightly miscast still lovable Rachel McAdams); sister Kit Kat; more. Tim – played perfect mix earnest awkwardness charm Domhnall Gleeson – also often faced situations don’t necessarily involve directly, make want use power nonetheless. Despite unfair advantage Tim life, you’re almost always rooting him. You almost tell he’ll use power, go. What makes want life turn way wants fact see Tim fundamentally good guy. He wouldn’t use power harm anyone, manner character written acted convinces almost instantly. The film’s weakest aspect time travel itself. Even though used intent conveying certain message time taken face value, fact remains takes many logical liberties far often. So, instead focusing ‘where’, ‘why’ ‘when’ – film actually supposed – you’re left wondering ‘how’ - happen, exactly, clearly ‘rules’? Simply put, you’re left thinking logical inconsistencies instead buying film’s core message. Also, film really slows towards end, message adequately hammered head times, still waits spell whole thing you. Despite voluminous plot holes, film’s warm, self-deprecating, quite British humour, performances, honest message film tries convey makes About Time film never offensive invariably happy. People certain frame mind often look particular kind film catch DVD TV elevate mood. About Time precisely kind film. Either directly indirectly, make see there’s greater waste time bad mood.
