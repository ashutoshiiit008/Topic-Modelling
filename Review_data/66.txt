A true villain doesn't attachments pretty much soulless. Why wants achieve ALL, one knows, that's wants - achieve all. The lack reason instills fear enemies audience. Kancha (Sanjay Dutt) truly detached villain Viju (Hrithik Roshan) trying get there. Every time commits murder, see weight sadness Viju's eyes, reminds us parents wouldn't approve. That difference makes audience root Viju dreading Kancha. And polarity emotions characters makes Agneepath watch well-worth time money. The charm 1990's Agneepath watching Vijay Dinanath Chauhan struggle father's ideology became intrinsic thought world really needs dealt with; seeking mother's, thus 'good' world's approval knowing one way avenge father's death. 22 years later, struggle blunted. Yet, charm taken new form. His single-minded focus seeking redemption revenge takes almost t-h-r-e-e hours watching film. In SMS age that, itself, huge achievement. It argued couple songs could've done away with, exactly Agneepath takes rightly 90s style film-making. Build tension, break tension good-sounding music lyrics, build tension within said song keep story stalling let beak another intense/action sequence. This tempo worked well way it's done here, live used right hands. Sure, nostalgia hidden there, I'm really interested seeing generation, hasn't grown style, reacts. Enter Hrithik Roshan. While "star" value rope enough audiences Gen-X, he's unlikely remind previous generation Amitabh Bachchan. That won't hasn't done good job, has, director, Karan Malhotra's interpretation Vijay Dinanath Chauhan different. So intense gaze serious demeanour first hour screen-time feel relief joy see smile. Priyanka Chopra must've known signed film she, like character, Kaali, required lend support. She plays simple girl simple needs role perfection. The backdrop Kaali grew grants enough leeway make her, cheesy, silly, smitten-in-love character, adorable. Similarly, it's good see Kancha (Sanjay Dutt) slight change background gives additional motivation love particular village. Yet, I wish character less dramatic. The madness represents made caricature thus tad bit comical. This stands even worse none characters really cartoon sketches. And know, underworld, drugs body-trading backdrop enough scope mockery. A ready available character played Rishi Kapoor, Lala. Through film, forget watching one star another, see Rishi Kapoor beating beaten Hrithik Roshan, certain line crossed suddenly realize intensity what's going on-screen. A moment created, even pleasant kind. I also liked moments makers chose keep original like one Viju mother dinner one Viju visits Officer Gaitonde's house. Also, new moments created like one Viju living sister's childhood would've liked one shows intentions getting married. I admit, moments might make movie sappy little longer would like, certainly added second dimension Viju's character - makes likeable despite mean streak. Yet, doesn't mean layers various characters fascinating peel off. A couple dimensions character chosen given definite shape - enough keep engaged. Yet, plugging holes original doesn't mean new ones aren't created. Some things came easily Viju events needed better explanation. But, today's Agneepath still better version retaining lot I loved 90s. More importantly, Agneepath loses unnecessary comic relief doesn't glamorize oh-so opportune exotic locations. Now question, people either belong 1990-Agneepath cult never seen it, nothing compare to?
