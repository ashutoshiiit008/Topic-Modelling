Ram vs. Raavan simple enough good vs. evil fight. Unless struggle Ram Raavan you. Nautanki Saala intriguing conflict set heart - one within. Remarkably enough, also manages, great extent, keep things light quippy dialogue. Unfortunately though, slacks often not, story loses way kind intrigue exists one characters. The plot starts man today called Ram (Ayushman Khurana), good true, saving stranger's life. Interestingly enough plays Raavan stage show directs too. The quirky treatment outlandish start gives film dream-like ambiance. But pretty amazing atmosphere created doesn't let implausibility bother you. However, lasts first hour so. The turn events second half take Nautanki Saala regular girl-boy zone. Except glimpses protagonist's struggle himself, situations become pretty ordinary. Not mention, Ram Mandar (Kunal Roy Kapoor), characters lame outset. Especially women. While Chitra (Gaelyn Mendonca) refreshingly understanding maturity isn't consistent. The lady, Nandini (Pooja Salvi) dumb dumber both. That one man would fall love her, extremely unconvincing. Also, neither Chitra Pooja helped performances. Both Gaelyn Pooja plastic dolls given trendy styles wear. The men however, magnificent job keeping engaged performances. Kunal Roy Kapoor's Mandar eternally depressed yet, quirkily funny evoking side enjoys dark humor. A characters break regional language seems unnatural part film superficially delivered actors. Ayushman Khurana wins charming performance. He plays Ram part trying keep internal Raavan bay, equal conviction. All making look natural effortless. Expect blown way kisses girl - one natural, comfortable convincing on-screen kisses I seen Hindi cinema. It's pretty much two witty dialogue keeps going 2+ hours film. It slows considerably, picking pace unevenly, longish while. The quirks enjoyable, enough slapstick humor, form sexual toilet humor usual slapping around falling people, attempting make laugh. The ambiance created colors, lighting music slick helps keep dragging parts alive. Yet, given premise, it's sad narrative didn't take beyond obvious Ramayan references. The hat tip towards one us wears mask churns life full drama subtle enjoyable. But, boils ordinary romance takes away Nautanki Saala!
