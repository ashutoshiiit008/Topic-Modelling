Doesn't actually feel like every actor needs action film he/she honest and/or do-gooder fighting corrupt system? Actually, specific that. It like every actor film like Prakash Raj villain. So, Singh Saab The Great adds Sunny Deol's name list. As expected, loud gets louder minute. And entire 150 those, less. I must say slight twist concept interesting give even audience begins appreciate it. Other though, run-of-the-mill tedious gets. The action choreographer tries shock every going little top. But, end slightly amused rather awed gimmicks. Even interesting deviations terms writing, emotions never engage. It much due exposed theme writing performances. Over-written dialogue delivered Sunny Deol manner used decades. For rest Prakash Raj whose performance could've impact the, goodness knows many, 15th time we've seen it. What I found absolutely ridiculous sudden introduction communal tone. It comes blue way late scheme things. It thus ends sounding like afterthought. Not way much thought put plot, anyway. And yet, isn't knew expect? The Deols - seem world own. That world either three lead roles, else cameos one lead. This world audience enjoys cars lifted turned around single-handedly famous two-and-a-half-kilo hand. This world impervious likes dislikes outsiders. I watch because, well I like giving every movie chance. Or maybe masochism comes easily me.
