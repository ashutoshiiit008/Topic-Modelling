Senthil, Venkat Pari three engineering students prestigious Ideal Engineering College run terrifying Virumandi Santhanam better known students ‘Virus’. Sound familiar? That Shankar’s latest flick, Nanban, remake highest grossing Indian film time – Rajkumar Hirani’s 3 Idiots - secret. Shankar isn’t exactly greatest exponent art craft cinema. But always someone I admired, simply ability close eyes visualize bigger Indian filmmakers. What truly disappointing though time round, Shankar closed eyes, saw exactly Rajkumar Hirani did. The characters, idiosyncrasies, nicknames (and shockingly, even continuity goof!) remain same. Any attempt giving movie away would futile, considering billion people already watched 3 Idiots. There doubt fact that, standalone film, Nanban fairly enjoyable. In fact, opinion, script 3 Idiots actually lends towards cinematically adapted Tamil Hindi character quirk-driven comedies often funnier South Indian languages. Nanbanmotors along largely competent cast look parts. Though far away, Vijay still right side 40, Shankar’s credit, unlike Mr. Hirani hoped audience would look way. More importantly, Vijay looks closer supposed age self-anointed champion ‘sensible cinema’ 3 Idiots. Jeeva Srikanth extremely likeable roles played Sharman Joshi Madhavan respectively. Even Sathyan darn sight better Omi Vaidya. Sathyaraj Virus convincing succeeds turning character overt caricature. Ileana (playing Kareena Kapoor’s character) looks gorgeous arresting screen presence. The music Harris Jayaraj pleasant easy ears. Most tracks hum-worthy, though tracks unwanted flow film. While phenomenon remakes ‘sequels’ anyway worst thing happen cinema since Tusshar Kapoor, remake accepted brings least something new table. ‘Nanban’ never going shake ‘been-there-seen-that’ feeling. However, absolutely unforgivable official remake shamelessly copies original, change nature core target audience notwithstanding. I always enjoy listening co-audience react see screen, time different. However, I must confess, I get PVR guys remake couple cups coffee go distance.
