"What...are people? What kind hatred...is this?" Jt Commissioner Maria (Nana Patekar) baffled inconceivable ruthlessness 26/11 attacks 26 November, 2008. In another scene he's seeking help Central Government attacks on, helplessness comes exasperated, "I don't know do." The thought behind two sentences reverberate within, even said loud. The large space lines makes terrorist attack is. Its attempt address lines makes The Attacks 26/11 movie worth watching. Unprepared, untrained, unequipped - that's police force would facing terror attack nature. It's nothing done prepare, train equip better, attack without tip, bound catch local law enforcement off-guard - people walking around limitless ammunition, willing kill die. Just like airplane crashes building several cases serial bombing. The first half numbs episodes 26/11 attacks one another. In half though, weird camera angles, ridiculous focus various statues (Laughing Buddha favorite!), loud screeching violins background - annoy distract. But content close home mostly ignore them. The body count seems exaggerated, CST station Taj Hotel (even film uses Taj lobby symbol died injured places day.) But, throughout make small connects people could care - children course, police officers regular by-standers. The connect obviously could someone know. And Ram Gopal Verma appropriately cashes connect, even little finesse. Whether film would human, engaging, hands another director - I don't want know. In fact, issue remains throughout. Am I connecting film characters film narrated inherent connect incident itself? Unfortunately, something I never able answer. And work film's favor forever. Also, I sure many unsung heroes incident didn't make way film. Surely, many changes additions events provide bit drama needed make story film. Way many times first half, wonder, "How know happened?" everyone involved died. Also, film covers events 26/11 two days after. Yet, cinematic liberty allow maker trying go beyond occurrences one event. The second half two main scenes bring balance I didn't think film event could bring about. It would safe say nation mood understand psyche terrorist audacity holding one cities ransom. So, try bring sermon setting right wrong might considered cop-out brave; filmy wise - depending stand is. Surprisingly, I found awe (lapping up) Jt Commissioner Maria's word-for-word, thought-for-thought, concept-for-concept response spiel. All credit awesome dialogue writing overpowering dialogue delivery. Not mention, thought behind said monologue, resonates attitude towards strong religious sentiment used context justification hideous acts. Someone said loud. It doesn't matter whether Jt Commissioner actually conversation real life. Here director talking us, citizens country. And maybe hopes reach oddball Jihadi ends watching film. And happen, manner done reaches viewer's gut Nana Patekar's performance one scene could enough warrant watch. What relief see resort typical style, take restrained route. Even without monologue, one shot offered water shows needs histrionics good performance. Here, close-ups used brilliantly. Sanjeev Jaiswal Kasab induces enough hatred want watch film again. Then again, character fictional. Only films determine whether good actor. For now, audience restless whenever screen abused strongly shows didn't goof up. Despite good film, difficult shake disgust felt I heard director, Ram Gopal Verma visited site attacks day after. Insensitive him, irresponsible people allowed happen. The negativity visit brought about, stay forever always black mark product. Yet, films important. If remind us difference fundamentals religion fundamentalist, remind us questions stop asking resilient selves, "Are shores secure today?"
