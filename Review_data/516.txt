I can't decide moved more. The way author's take Islam - use abuse religion - unfolded, someone even dared touch upon openly first place, Pakistan. I think would makers kind story even India - secular state. And climax, I amazed number issues Khuda Kay Liye touched upon. We whole gamut. Atrocities faced women hands fellow-Muslims, double standards Muslim parents living abroad (I seen non-Muslim Indians too), injustice disseminated racial profiling, Jihadi's misuse easily-influenced-relatively-meek youngsters turn terrorists. Each problem given space breathe develop. The parallels drawn racial profiling storyline based Chicago things happening Pakistan amazing. There points interchange US law officials Jihadi leaders terms unyielding attitude towards whatever believe truth. How mince words people say want listen to. And make sure audience doesn't miss parallels, similarities directly shown towards climax. The strong clever dialogues huge role play overall impact In name Godhad. I wondering much effect would I understood language completely. The use Urdu elegant, time entirely overwhelming. Since movie less situation-driven make fair guess context. However, lack aptitude departments story dialogue. In particular, editing abrupt didn't render smooth flow. The exception climax scene courtroom, cuts worked towards narrating story. Similarly, songs beautiful, shifts western classical background music seemed pretty random. Most actors came across stiff. Only, Shan (Mansoor) stood excellent performance - inspired musician completely broken man. Fawad Khan played confused youngster, Sarmad, look aptly baffled. So would soon judge whether really enact emotions. But, given strength message shortcomings seem pardonable. The questions I left - Has reached right ears? Or least people sitting fence convinced keep committing heinous acts?
