The title, promotional previews, media publicity give impression movie Gandhi Jr., Harilal, struggle shadow dynamic father. But, end all, comes across tool sensitize country fact Gandhiji made many sacrifices meets eye. Yet another movie Gandhiji's point view. The emotional trauma Harilal, Baa rest family side-lined. The experience feels incomplete. The movie starts brilliantly. I truly intrigued way see Gandhiji father. You could see human element instead usual demi-god status simple man accorded. The parent-child problem felt real much like parent-child problem - diverse expectations, disappointment directions, inevitable frustration. It really threw light totally different aspect Gandhiji. Alas, cookie crumbles. And director could maintain tension past first half hour. Soon enough, Gandhiji put back pedestal. And movie becomes documentation history independence. A snippet Gandhiji time, another Harilal time - literally alternating rhythmically. This also gives movie choppy feel. Scenes cut guise fade-ins fade-outs rather flowing narrative. It's actors make worth watch. You could feel Gandhiji's inclination towards aspirations country feeling responsibility towards family. Darshan Jariwala done great justice portray various shades Gandhiji's personality - calm, preachy, upset, firm, ambitious, etc. I usually don't care weak, loser-type characters stories. But, Akshaye Khanna makes feel nervous, diffident, eager-to-please Harilal huge image live to. You sense pressure son faces - wanting impress father fortunately unfortunately discovering mind ambitions own. Shefali Shah, usual, leaves spell-bound. One look imagine Baa must going time. Her make-up person needs special mention - wrinkle seemed received minute attention. And I cannot forget Bhumika Chawla's expressions frustration helplessness, though little time screen. I found background settings extremely distracting. For movie set early-mid 20th century, not-so-bright subject matter, colors seemed bright objects background new. These things took away drama could created. Also, clich√©d use rain demonstrate pathos life characters in-the face. The solemn background music could much retain drama given cheerful visuals. Of course, could argued colors walls change according whether happy sad, freshly painted wall room person doesn't enough feed family, doesn't gel. My main complaint though remains allowed entry minds characters. A huffy-puffy Harilal enough convey frustration. His motivations never explained. Or matter, Gandhiji's justifications decisions clarified either. Even give benefit doubt information might available, question remains - make movie relationships without knowing rationale behind characters' behavior? I set see son father nation like. I came glimpses relationship whole lot unanswered questions. Fortunately, I also came fine performances entire cast. Which enough keep movie complete disappointment.
