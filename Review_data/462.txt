Same old story, old acting, old music, old choreography, fresh direction! Shirish Kunder used different enjoyable style direct flashbacks dream sequences. Such innovativeness needs applauded encouraged. Jaan-E-Mann appreciated particular novel approach, expect anything more. Note direction new, comedy. It almost all…SLAPSTICK!!! 3-4 good laughs enough pull movie, based solely comedy, through. It shame embellished colour, lighting, photography used convey emotions. It shame wigs exaggerated make-up used compensate lack comic timing “stars”. It shame Anupam Kher, Anupam Kher…the immensely talented comedian unnecessarily dwarfed nasal voice make movie funny. Now, disgrace! Moreover, generally overenthusiastic cameraman used weird camera angle even weirder camera tricks create midget effect. Ridiculous, funny, I say. And anyway, people really think midgets people laughed at?!? The rest ordinary. The story slightly, slightly amended regular love-triangle-catapulting-woman-between-two-men affair. The much advertised twists hardly bend nerve brain. The screenplay choppy; transition scene scene abrupt. And movie good 30 minutes long. Preity Zinta yet another ‘girl friend/spouse’ role, regular flair. She looks beautiful, especially pinks peaches. Salman Khan uses superbly toned body overcome lack talent - again; someone ought tell muscle movement good face too. Akshay Kumar wastes potential clowning around aimlessly. Aman Verma looks like competing loudest speaker year award. The performances helped inappropriate sound mixing. In songs, voices loud barely listen music scenes background music overshadows dialogue. The music 'humko maloom hai' agonizing, especially 'galtiyaaaaaaaan'. The lyrics ‘sad - humko maloom hai’ ‘ajnabee shehar’ good. But looks like Gulzar saahab specifically asked write extra simple lines target audience. Most songs outright prose – poetry. But, hey it’s festive season, cares plots good lines? There enough takers tomfoolery, one giver.
