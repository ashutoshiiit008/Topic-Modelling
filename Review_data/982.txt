Romantic-Action-Comedy sounded like mash. So I heard, genre McG’s next film (director Charlie’s Angels series) This Means War, I worried. Two things could happened here: film could go way frivolous films go really good actors. Case point: No Strings Attached Natalie Portman right Black Swan. Nobody really deduce serious actors chose make genre jump. Or one could also expect actors like Reese Witherspoon Tom Hardy salvage film. This Means War aftertaste Charlie’s Angels films bit Mr. Mrs. Smith. Chris Pine Tom Hardy CIA agents (and best friends) happen fall girl, Lauren (Witherspoon). Let's ignore moment Pine Hardy look nothing like CIA agents, male-model type looks swanky apartments live in. As compensation you'd expect distracting entertainment part. But apart sprinkling witty banter, every bit one-upmanship indulge borderline creepy voyeuristic way it's done - unlike secretive swift demeanor CIA agents act (or popular culture would us believe. However, film pick pace bits, picking comic elements fight love leading men rather adorable "May best spy win" rut. Lauren ofcourse, unaware rather cute regular Reese Witherspoon way (see: Legally Blonde). You would think since she’s done many rom-coms, Witherspoon would able breeze role, reason three actors perform extremely laboriously. The worst lot Tom Hardy, bad casting option film. I found regularly zoning out, making callous references better films (Warrior, Inception). The film also real villain, Heinrich (Til Schweiger), seems rather inconsequential larger scheme things. The film categorically revolves around glorifying set sequences Pine Hardy fight lady. The action sequences loud, virtue catch attention. But retrospect, also plain rely sound design jolt opposed visuals. Having offered critique though, I think it’s fair inform kids come watch movie ball. Evidently humor film relatable moments when, due sheer peer pressure, I laugh loud. There funny moments punch dialogues (and really, much expected bunch good actors film). This Means War sassy fun first Charlie’s Angels movie was, it’s waste time either. You might enjoy yourself.
