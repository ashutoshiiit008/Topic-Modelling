I loved last 30 minutes. There, I said it. I'll add finer details. The whole "formation" thingy brilliant imagination execution mani-manifold better. I'd love see 3-D. Did I mention, it'd much shorter film context would've least pretend make sense? And there, I threw away brownie points I ever going earn Rajni-fan. Damn! I serious question. Where Rajni Robot? The cool formations I talking about, Rajnikanth sir? As I remember last Rajni-film I saw, whole essence film Rajni, human Rajni, could cool things. Like say, flip cigarette air, catch right corner lips, done three summersaults, course happened 'The Man' flipped air first place. Here superpowers adorned character, robot. Let elaborate further, see Dabangg, Salman Khan played Salman Khan. So, even I didn't like it, I could understand high Salman-fan would watching strut about. But here, I don't get it. Why would Rajni-fan want see Robot? Isn't insult essence? Shouldn't something like 'Rajnikanth adds R obot?' Note I'm even complaining complete lack logic disregard anything intelligent. Even best special effect films need thin boundary within needs keep itself. I mean create robot fight country talk mosquitoes cheat exams swim purse. How name Rajnikanth cool? I vow complain lousy action sequences rest film, ridiculous choreography even worse lyrics music. Palm refused budge face whenever song presented itself. Also note I long dropped wish complain I thought Aishwarya Rai robot. How could I whole system mechanized. At first, I got feeling story churned machine. But I banished thought soon I realized producer abducted machine, took calls much money pump in. Anyway, looks like producer, like me, complain torture endured hands machine. Just heard cousin Bangalore tickets Robot selling Rs. 10,000 black market today. Even if, exaggeration sliced 10%, buyer even give choice liking film?
