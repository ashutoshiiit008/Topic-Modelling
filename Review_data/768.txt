I state shock. Ready actually sort-a, kind-a coherent story. Well course, I'm using word coherent loosely. And story. And what-the-hell, "sort-a, kind-a" too. What I'm trying get is, Ready focus. Or focus director's last outing actor's last outing. Put together, course. I'm joking sarcastic I say, I found one-liners movie references Readyquite witty. I talk defensively general contempt "mindless entertainers". So, standard "boy hates girl yet wants save big, bad world" routine. Boy Prem (surprise!) get away anything played standard Salman Khan "I get away anything, take that, reviewers!" I actually saw one one-liner I smiled thought, "wow! Comic timing all, huh?" I don't get phrases like "paisa vasool" "time-pass". And surely I know nothing works Salman fans. For example, Sakshi (one two Salmaniacs I know) tweeted - Okay first half isn't great anything. 2nd half zillion times better. And I thought post interval, film became Anees Bazmee's world (along distasteful sproduction values). Till then, stuff believable range. Like, could see Prem liked Sanjana vice versa. Such logic totally unheard genre. Also, makes Ready shade different Salman films characters film something do. They tad props work towards establishing cool Salman is. For example, Mohan Joshi amusing quips. Though mockery Paresh Rawal makes pretty much same. Asin looks barely presentable. What went wrong, make-up dada? Another thing happened attempt passing social message. The irony social message beyond hilarious. A husband realizes he's oppressing wife, gives woman "permission" eat him!?! But, know well I do, amount "different" within confines Anees Bazmee make enough make film I whole-heartedly recommend. And, know well I do, Salman Khan fan cares two hoots I recommend not. Go along watch next "creative" way shirt comes off!
