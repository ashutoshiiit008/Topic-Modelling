The growth Marathi cinema seen last years truly warms heart. What sets apart fact inherent honesty cinema. Marathi films often capture certain flavor life Maharashtrian – rural setting like Deool urban backdrop like Hello Jai Hind. I feel delighted I think fact new Marathi film watch every week. This week, I three new releases choose from. So, I read, ‘Pratibimb story revolves around newly married couple…’ I felt I didn’t need read further. I made choice. What followed one instances life one needs insert ‘note self’. Pratibimb turned shockingly amateurish film confused genre wanted belong to, really wanted audience, general, point trying make. Any hopes aforementioned honesty dashed first five minutes itself, following poorly performed executed item song starring Sonali Kulkarni clothes reminded one Kajol wore first half Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, cheaper. After said newly married couple get newly married, newly married wife gets shock life discovers newly married husband isn’t newly married – married earlier. And blows wind windpipe fact first wife, dead, exact replica her. All revealed first ten minutes film itself. What follows part-horror, part-crime mostly silly story inane twists turns would make Abbas Mustan puff chests pride. The film wears extremely dated look poorly cut. There times I astounded poor technical aspects film sub-standard product saw release first place. Now I one hanker technique interesting story tell. The main problem film story ridiculous makes Ready look like Mughal-E-Azam. Touching upon issues like screenplay, characterization narrative structure, then, would akin explaining nuances cricket Texan. To fair, second half film hooked. I eager know exactly inane-ness leading to. I was, quite literally, edge seat. A part me, unabashed cinema lover, hoping climax film would make preceding nonsense, would make sit straight say, ‘You trying make thriller? Well, I get thrilled.’ Again, note self. The climax film, reason supposed spooky-creepy stuff happening earlier, insult one’s intelligence I wanted film green tea Casablanca. In words, I really needed flush conscious sub-conscious. For actors, really nothing much say. Sonali Kulkarni tries hard fails. Ankush Choudhary saddled worst role film, strange poetic justice way performs it. Ganesh Yadav, known mainly character roles number Hindi films based underworld, competent. So Ravindra Mankani, fine actor. The rest are, well, there. Bluntly put, Pratibimb disappointing resulted read page far. Go figure.
