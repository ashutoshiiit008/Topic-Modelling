Okay, I’m going try come cooler idiom ‘Too many cooks spoil broth’. Let’s see. How about, many celebrities (actors) turn “movie” greeting card. Yep, that’s pretty much New Year’s Eve – Every recollect-able, sellable face imagine, thrown clichéd, predictable movie commercial consumerist idea New Year’s Eve. New Year’s Eve movie various characters separate experiences New Year’s Eve day. You Ashton Kutcher Lea Michelle (of Glee fame) get stuck elevator. Kutcher’s anti-New Year’s eve feelings gets converted Michelle, who’s backup singer makes realize everyone hopes pinned one day start fresh. Robert DeNiro dying, last wish watch ball-drop (a Times Square tradition) eve. But hospital’s policy doesn’t allow move bed. Michelle Pfeiffer stuck dull, thankless job, help Zac Efron, spends day fulfilling desires. Katherine Heigl meets Jon Bon Jovi dinner catering for, he’s performing Rockstar Jensen. They struggle keep past feelings bay. Sarah Jessica Parker plays protective mother Abigail Breslin (of Little Miss Sunshine fame) resolve issues let love hope overcome everything. It followed “uplifting” background music meant make abandon cynicism. You know, peppy pianos, litte hip-hop ofcourse, HAD end film ‘What Wonderful World’. I think biggest issue New Year’s Eve screenwriter’s (Katherine Fugate) inability connect characters. Having multiple mini-stories works slowly unfold each, let viewers live stories. The makers obsessed, packaging commercial commodity, putting everything remotely sellable (Zac Efron instance, High School musical fame), I’m surprised Twilight cast isn’t involved film. New Year’s Eve light moments though. Pfeiffer adorable reserved middle-aged woman gets genuine joy things never imagined. Halle Berry hot always, she’s one person whole film doesn’t overact. It’s sort tiring place almost every light-hearted film “Hollywood” churns out, kind movie you’d want breeze flipping channels. New Year’s Eve clichéd film wants believe perfected formula making money box office. Sigh, watch Love Actually you’re mood hope, love holiday positivity.
