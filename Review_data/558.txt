unknown cast makers, there's much audience goes expecting. A movie called Let's Dance thing, I guess think might catch glimpse new moves. Unfortunately isn't anything spectacular graceful choreography dancer. It ain't bad either, regular fare. I actually admired actor playing protagonist, Gayatri Patel didn't come across stunning gorgeous. She actually short stout could considered compared model-turned-actresses today. She cast regular mannerism talking except Anjan Srivastav whose lines delivered little exaggerated. The cast otherwise looked like normal people going daily lives. This could also translate boring. The official website boasts six-year old Nikuunj Pandey "by far experienced actor let's dance." Okay, there's it'd great fun make full use information trash actor's capabilities. But Aquib Afzaal's Gayatri's accents cast actually pretty decent job. And non-trivial attempt masking accents too. All actors bring across character's traits. Aquib's attitude, Gayatri's sincerity, Ajay Chaudhary's chocolate boyishness, Master Abhaas Yadav's simmering frustration, Sugandha Garg's practical approach life - add facets story. Unfortunately though story doesn't move forward much, does, stays long feels like progress made. There interesting elements main sub-plots extremely predictable. So, expected happens usual feeling anti-climax. It doesn't feel like sort-of conflict leads anywhere forgone conclusion. The transformations events convenient basically cop-out. If little put in, terms creating engrossing atmosphere, film could triggered little interest. Alas, good-natured plot well-meaning characters take film far.
