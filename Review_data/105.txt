Children's minds full fantasies, wonders, adventures probably not. They fancy world fairyland build around it. Their wings don't need spaceships traverse galaxies. The universe becomes never-ending canvas, colours dreams fearlessly portray desires achieve impossibilities. Even tiniest thing turns matter obsession them. Indeed, makes fascinating story. Avatarachi Goshta tries capture craze absolutely candid manner, sometimes even reviving childhood memories. Alas, film fails get lot mileage compelling story. The soul film lies Dashavtar tales Indian mythology. Kaustubh - innocent, little boy - finds strong resonance stories. He tirelessly listens Lord Vishnu's folkloric adventures. His granny tells Vishnu take human avatar - Kalki, destroy darkness Kaliyuga (the present era). One thing leads another Kaustubh feels none Kalki avatar. happens next surely worth exploring. And despite prolonged dullness film's writing well execution. Avatarachi Goshta adorned innocence plenty funny elements sleeves. It doesn't turn laugh riot though. The subtleness comic moments goes film's favour. Nevertheless, also ends disappointing long run. Lengthy sequences Kaustubh Amod (Adinath Kothare) could've far bearable, lacked humorous touch. Well, don't essentially require comedy stay hooked film. This one, however, badly needed solid, crisp dialogues. Writer-director Nitin Dixit tries really hard make engrossing, moments even set inspirational ending. He smartly captures insecurities faced kids. Thankfully, doesn't go detailing problems. But efforts fall short create philosophical noise instead. Dixit's directional style good, exceptional. His minor mistakes (really minor even notice) hamper story's freshness, making film little sluggish tedious. Mihiresh Joshi plays Kaustubh's part well. Had guided diligently, could've impactful. Yet, I glad see Kothare natural role. Not excellent actor. Nonetheless, atheist tenant looks significantly convincing chocolate-boy last film Premasathi Coming Suun. After seeing film's trailer, I quite impressed camerawork. Yes; tries stunning right beginning, pretty much succeeds endeavours well. Unfortunately, lacks purpose. It Avatarachi Goshta fails. In fact, one refreshing stories year. But problem won't live time come.
