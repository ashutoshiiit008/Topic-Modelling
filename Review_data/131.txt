I walked Battleship weekend wondering could ever create innovative alien-invasion movies. They’re predictable I wish I getting paid thoughts came next. In Battleship, American Navy machismo savior – protecting world wrath extra-terrestrials. It’s ironical however, choose Rihanna posters film, Liam Neeson (most noted Schindler’s List) Taylor Kitsch (X-Men John Carter) playing relevant characters. The film begins American scientists sending radio signals space (thankfully it’s tad skillfully done Koi Mil Gaya) hope finding life planets. We know that’s wrong move – chance blue cute thing magic powers appear quite slim big-budgeted Hollywood film. In 3D. Long story short: Giant aliens arrive sea massive transforming spaceships intention invade Earth. It responsibility small Navy team coast Hawaii save world. The team headed Officer Alex Hooper (Taylor Kitsch). Rihanna plays arms officer Hooper’s warship. She’s every man’s fantasy sense, (a portrayal definitely problem) handles guns screams authority every then. The problem is, given back story involvement American Navy, even reasoning brutal character. Actually, none characters inter-personal relationships such. We keep cutting apocalyptic discussions VFX-heavy action sequences. Such films usually rely grand looking action. Battleship however, lot boom-boom-boom. Too much noise, mindless non-dramatic action. There’s tension built evil alien invaders courageous human fighters. Not even background music, seems staple action-heavy films. Rihanna’s plus film though, army clothes, handling guns rather well. You’ve got give credit making debut mindless film, makling seem like really bagged role lifetime. The last 30 minutes Battleship really expect film: unadulterated action build-up logic it. Loud background score, induces feelings you, makes wonder you’ll ever able hear properly again, sense achievement whatsoever. Hearing death-metal band vocalist scream would better exercise ears. My suggestion is, watch film nuts Rihanna, really don’t want use brains all. But don’t curse still come sense wasted time.
