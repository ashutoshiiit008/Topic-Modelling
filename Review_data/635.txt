Mod takes time establish characters settle in. Meanwhile, audience absorbing atmosphere little town named Ganga, everyone knows everyone. You follow Ayesha (Ayesha Takia) goes daily routine unknowingly know much life exposure one day life. That "unknowingly" bit power good story-telling. Without realizing it, I knew grew fond Ayesha, strong-headed woman, important register story moves on. Also, combination Ayesha Takia's cute, baby(?) face girl take care young age, make Ayesha (the character) even likeable. Ayesha Takia portrays girl nuances - fear, distrust, sure-headedness, uncertainties, feeling loved - covers all. Unfortunately, cannot said Rannvijay Singh. I wouldn't say disappointed, casting wasn't fair strongly written character. On hand, maybe films characters later, he'd ready one. A mentally unstable character easy role play anyone. That illness wasn't dramatized glamorized endeared Mod. I'm pretty sure, situations reactions shown film medically correct, yet entire story emotional angle draws story outcome. Mod strong, serious story told sensitivity conviction. Welcom back, Mr. Kukunoor. How much ever, I like experimentation, I'm glad done it, least break.
