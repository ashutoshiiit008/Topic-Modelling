I want actor - I one half facial expressions. Oh, mean I nasal singer crack poor joke big screen? The good thing though, I would need music director one tune head. Lyricists change words around bit must readily available. No, never mind, I can't, I don't wear cap houseful theater would hoot whistle at. Too predictable one talk Himesh's cap, well badly timed joke it, can't I? Okay, I exaggerated music bit. Himesh certainly tried least one tune ("Dil na todna") little usual style, listening wish hadn't. The camerawork lighting first song "assalaam vaalekum" beautiful. But things deteriorate. Song-after-song-after-song (thank 5 times). On way forgets pronunciation - never heard "bina" "tanhaiyaan" crooned badly. And top off, sacrilege called "Mehbooba mehbooba". Were actually given permission song Sholay? Dear Mr. Burman, I apologize listening version arguably one best compositions. And it, Mohammad Rafiji, I sorry laughing loud done "dard-e-dil" Karz. Having totally trashed two main attractions movie - lack acting Himesh Reshammiya music - I must tell something myself. I patient person far movies concerned. It usually difficult movie bore me. Even half hour post interval, I hopeful. Hopeful least story actual thriller. Alas, completely lose thereafter! Far causing sort thrill, bits slow - allowing enough unintended giggle-time - thus bored till hair torn apart. The last half hour plain, outright, superbly ridiculous!! Who gave right take us much granted?! There well rounded characters really complain character inconsistency. Anyone anything nothing. Most characters transform evil good without slightest provocation inane dialogues support. And glaring gaps I don't really right talk details like person changing cap arrested. Ah yes, I mention quintessential "oomph" factor - Ms. Sherawat. She bit. Flaunts body, dances couple dances, utters mandatory line two, character plot all. And Ms. Motwani, well, looks sweet much eye-shadow on, barely open eyes. Oh yeah, lipstick Sachin Khedekar bright orange lip gloss Pankaj Jha? What I say interesting part two+ hours spent theater 30 second teaser "Sultan The Warrior" (actually looking forward it!)?
