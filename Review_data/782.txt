The first genuine children’s film I’ve seen long time, Rise Guardians heart right place. Based book series called The Guardians Childhood William Joyce, film talks values like faith children believing true magic, let’s face it; childhood time do, rationality cynicism erode beliefs grow up. Jack Frost (voiced Chris Pine), Spirit Winter, frustrated centuries children don’t believe him; invisible this. Meanwhile, children across world facing new threat called The Bogeyman (Jude Law), frightening children. Enter Santa Claus group known The Guardians - group also comprises Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny Sandman – widely loved characters Bogeyman making children lose belief in. The idea film seems exciting enough; popular children’s characters new, superhero-like avatars; strategizing, grouping fighting evil characters like Bogeyman. So tattooed Santa, called ‘North’ friends lives (which also gives strange accent host Big Foots companions); boomerang-toting Easter Bunny isn’t afraid use it; Tooth Fairy assortment miniature assistants; reinvention characters make interesting, smile-worthy moments. My personal favourite character film, Bogeyman, also called ‘Pitch’ short ‘Pitch Black’, makes interesting villain. He feeds fear children, intriguingly mischievous look places grey total black. The character keeps things interesting, often transgressing intense realm never losing sight main target audience – children. The film also helped immensely great animation. In fact, even characters, makes Rise Guardians watchable animation breathless camera captures action quite well. However, 3D quite generic. One wonders filmmakers still insist 3D, cases dim bright film. But real problem Rise Guardians isn’t exciting enough story. While part trouble lies fact aimed children deliberately tried keep things simple, I suspect film probably exciting children either. There much focus Jack Frost’s journey, troubles resolution, providing crackerjack animated action film children. Also, film lacks substantially comes funny thrilling moments. It follows rather predictable graph, never throwing surprise truly excites. Also, far us Indians concerned, us don’t intricate connect characters, save Santa Claus perhaps. Rise Guardians means unwatchable, falls way short must-watch children’s film. This one really children absolutely insist watching animated film around festive season.
