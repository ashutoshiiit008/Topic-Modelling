Don’t ever watch Wong Kar Wai film, you’re going text plays pause periodically. His films meant passive viewer – still don’t take advice, you’ll end film that, you, intercutting string incoherent perspectives. Multiple viewings proactive ongoing analysis necessary truly enjoy layers, symbolism quirks narrative. Being kind mood, I picked one older films, Days Being Wild. It’s convoluted story multiple characters dealing longing rejection. Mostly, see set complex endings even complex relationships. We start Yuddy (Leslie Cheung) handsome man, would also known smooth ladies' man. He manages move women, unintentionally breaking hearts, also realize soon enough instability stems fact adopted son prostitute mother. He salvages complexities oedipal complex letting relationships center around – flow, erupt, tangle. Through this, enter world Su Lizhen (Maggie Cheung) shy general store worker, gets affected mannerisms. She develops silent, fragile relationship local policeman (Andy Lau) backup broken heart, see Yuddy fall love cabaret dancer called Mimi (Carina Lau) – secretly loves Yuddy’s best friend Zeb (Jacky Cheung). All set backdrop Yuddy’s love-hate relationship mother. You may wander deduce string intricate liaisons originates mother-son duo – soon enough Wong Kar Wai creates different stream story. Days Being Wild isn’t plot heavy, story unfolds facet characters revealed. There’s sense thematic ambiguity – Wai doesn’t reveal choice portray particular ensemble stories – it’s ambiguity realize person bound desire. Wong Kar Wai’s unique visual approach evident Days Being Wild – fixates one scene, one character long enough establish narrative. Effortlessly, simple cinematography, bases complex thematic structures characters lets viewer, live narrative. His background music, acts catalyst forming jumbled, kaleidoscopic world head. The DVD Days Being Wild extras, features even trailer. It bit letdown – recurring trend Wong Kar Wai DVDs, get film. The subtitles options aplenty, though – Spanish, French, English Japanese. Days Being Wild charming. It’s positive film, won’t leave particularly simplistic thoughts end – warned. But it’s charming visual tale, assortment people deal basic human emotions personal manner. Watch relate, detach deduce complexities – let narrative tease intelligence play head.
