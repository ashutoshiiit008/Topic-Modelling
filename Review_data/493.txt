Subhash Ghai must first fire casting director. Then must think long hard whether anything truly worthwhile say cinema. And must think whether takes say it. Kaanchi, self-proclaimed magnum opus, abomination film, despite heart right place. Sure, it's good sign big commercial director makes big commercial film whole thrust leading lady, debutante that. It great see point leading lady film isn't ultimately end man. And course, always good see actor like Chandan Roy Sanyal let loose good time. But neither Ghai's latest discovery, young girl named Mishti, acting chops pull role plays, anyone apart Chandan Roy Sanyal anything comes across much better sound screeching nails blackboard - includes fine actors like Rishi Kapoor Mithun Chakraborty - who're made look like clowns caricatures. The film attempts show power woman will; attempts show country always held back corrupt men power; pretty much David versus Goliath tale, David woman. As I said, film certainly well-intentioned. Set small hamlet hills first half big bad urban world second, film follows innocent young Kaanchi suffers fights responsible misery. But shoddy writing - always problem Ghai's films - quite simply makes film ordeal sit through; monstrous runtime adding viewer's woes. Subhash Ghai comes across old-timer trying best tell contemporary tale. His language clearly days gone by, even story attempts contemporary. You see instantly, leader young political party wishes take system, stand stage sing part-rock, part-masala song lyrics sound like 'Jai Ho' (or Jaya He, perhaps). And Kaanchi reacting unlikely ways unlikely scenarios, can't help ask Ghai thinking. You never quite feel her, everything comes across made up, easy. Kaanchi's struggle make weep her. Instead, wonder little village belle manages outsmart many rich powerful people ease; essentially screenplay far many leaps faith take seriously. As film drags you've enough, almost feel thankful see end credits. You also wonder thought hasn't yet crossed Subhash Ghai's mind: "Even Sachin Tendulkar retired. What I still doing?"
