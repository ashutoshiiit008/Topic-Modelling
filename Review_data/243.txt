There seven stages falling love claims Dedh Ishqiya. Isn't beautiful director love, writer love, cinematographer love, producer love course, actors love - art? They almost sixth stage - obsession. Lovingly, balancing act go towards climax. And beauty take along them, leaving behind way. With Urdu (I refuse use glorifying adjective Urdu doesn't justice), poetry poise, one thing strikes quirkiness. Who would've thought Urdu quirk would blend well together. A character doesn't even scene film quirky dying wish. The contrast doesn't stop here. You foul-mouthed Babban (Arshad Warsi), loud-mouthed Muniya (Huma Qureshi) wannabe poet (Vijay Raaz) even everyday speak. Further enhancing opposites subtitles English. At first annoying, Urdu begins grateful them. And yet, Urdu isn't completely there. You approximate known words mean context. Very likely, writers took conscious decision dumb us. A wise decision balances becoming intelligent good over-explaining things. There couple spots couldn't resist spoon-feeding though jarring happens departs otherwise painstakingly created regal tone film. The rusty, dusty palette royal backdrop prince's palace enough keep engaged good part film. The music subtly stays background soulful lyrics songs. This works perfectly story adds layer layer itself. I loved subtle hints homosexuality - good bad. Then, main characters angle his/her own. The build-up half-time perfect twists ensue later film. Interestingly, even predictable don't mind it, still different norm. Similarly, wit lines, even predictable done words don't expect making fresh. Of course, helps cast insists topping terms charm, comic timing, dialogue delivery poise needed. Sure, find Madhuri Dixit little less glamorous vibrant heyday. But lady aging gracefully. That beside role demand plastic kind poise carries elegance. And lets hair down, reminds old self. Naseeruddin Shah lovable old fool love, smitten latest "love life". And yet carries shade gray believably. Arshad Warsi course, charming word go gullible idiot. Huma Qureshi mastered art woman knows exactly wants. Vijay Raaz perfect villain smitten protagonist. All - Madhuri Dixit Vijay Raaz need roles like these. For sakes theirs. And sake too, Dhai Ishqiya, I sure I want stay stage love - little less six full seven. A part wants next installment go challenge us zero spoon-feeding. A part wants stick balance. Why? Well, seventh stage rather deadly.
