And it’s wonder Juno won Academy Award Best Original Screenplay 2007. After watching Juno, won’t left over-powering cinematic feeling. You’ll left feeling like character Juno film yourself, simplistically relatable way. Juno 16 year old quirky girl (played remarkable Ellen Page) wiser beyond age. She decides sexual curiosity reached peak order satiate her, um, “questions” chooses best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). Unfortunately, finds pregnant, film begins here. There’s over-dramatic love-making scene - remember 30 second glimpse two making love Bleeker’s mouth tasted Orange Tic-Tac – it’s Juno remembers well. The film broken 4 seasons, corresponding Juno’s trimesters. Juno decides wants give child deserving parents – candidates played Mark Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman Jennifer Gardner).
