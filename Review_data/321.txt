Is anyone world dared use unparalleled power World Wide Web towards controversial daring endeavour WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange? A man single-handedly shook diplomatic establishment avante-garde whistleblowers' website, even cursory read Assange tell life story worth knowing about. You'd think would pretty hard mess film life man like Assange; you'd much material go wouldn't need put extra effort dramatize goings-on, attempt technical gimmickry make things appear interesting. Well, turns director last two Twilight films can, indeed, make mess. One key problems Bill Condon's The Fifth Estate jarring visual treatment; gritty, shaky camera nervous, frequent-cutting probably employed keep audience edge times, doesn't work. This kind film want writing talking, camera technique. Alas, narrative film flat, singularly uninspiring screenplay. The film merely documents key leaks took world storm, intermittently pausing show Assange well-intentioned egotistical, stubborn maniac - man didn't want relinquish control simply trusted one. There isn't anything film don't know couldn't guess. It watchable, rarely anything more. Of course, large part blame lies source material film. Based book 'Inside WikiLeaks: My Time Julian Assange World's Most Dangerous Website' Assange's erstwhile associate Daniel Domscheit-Berg, film rarely offers insight Assange, rarely delves truly thrilling spectacular secrets would shock world. Berg Assange well-known falling out, film doesn't particularly go way paint Assange negative light, almost seems like attempt exonerate Berg blame. All eyes Benedict Cumberbatch portrayal controversial figure. Well, Cumberbatch clearly tried hard. The problem effort shows. His mannerisms diction seem effected, though one can't fault failing convey right emotion. Daniel Br√ºhl, last seen Niki Lauda Rush, excellent always. He plays author book film based on. He least manages convince side story clearly. Even though Assange's character comes across merely slightly unusual piece cardboard. I doubt The Fifth Estate last film life times Julian Assange, surely there's whole lot man hitherto whistled blown about. While film ordinary best, something far interesting - true Assange style - open letter Assange wrote Benedict Cumberbatch film still early days. That letter, least, shred emotion it.
