"Oh look…what's that? Batman! Because looks like Gotham city!!" "No" "Oh wait! Spiderman!! He's spewing web wrist!" "NO!!!" Damn!! It's new bloke block called Prince…and he's charming superhero disguise, he's common thief trying act "yo..kewl" jazz! It's actually humiliating audience start thinking film terms of, "Which complaint I start with?" Action, direction, acting, casting, songs, music, plot, dialogue? The deeper stuff like characterization I'll even get giving genre benefit doubt. Just seen worse, doesn't make one anywhere close watchable. sigh Anyway, go… The base plot many-many interesting possibilities. A character loses memory. He possesses valuable immense importance smugglers, police, crossers double-crossers alike. We haven't foggiest want it, obviously waiting recollect he's kept piece. There's much could done mind games played cunning plots. But no, fed humbug memory forcefully removed inexplicable "medical science" thingy come back something like that. I don't care I'm made care. Story - strike out. Action film is, could I even begin enjoying it, thing I could think first 20-25 minutes is, "Exactly silly must Vivek Oberoi felt stuff front green screen?." Including dances! They inserted like used abruptly ages ago, break seriousness stuff going on. Many action films also bank suave lead characters memorable lines given. You got right, Prince one many. It Vivek Oberoi goodness sake! Ok, let's grant know cool clothes black shades pass stylish. But, women! Even though potentially, half-way interesting characters, extremely annoying say least.

The last I heard words said situation film 90s. I guess thank following ever-so-oft used main kahaan hoon? (Where I?) … Geez!! I guess that's question left audience answer. No existential "Who I? Where I?" The physical "Who I? Where I?", gotten deep slumber. Oh wait! But sleep look forward to! Yes, Prince 2 threatens come way open arms.
