Story-tellers often fascinated depths man plunges influence alcohol. If think deep addiction affects creativity, career, love, family, society you've got fodder plot, it's good enough woven screenplay. From India, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's Devdas , spun various versions screen. In West, one earliest films made theme, Billy Wilder'sThe Lost Weekend. Filmed 1945, Wilder chanced upon novel name railway journey Hollywood, The Lost Weekend, story four days life chronic alcoholic, possibly one best written films. I say so, films articulated effects alcohol human mind, desperation follows, one drink much yet, even hundred enough. That’s exactly dilemma film's protagonist Don Birnam (Ray Milland, Oscar winning performance), struggling writer hailed Hemingway 19-year old college, 33 cannot put pen paper, mind always asking "to drink first". Wilder makes Birnam express desperation, frustration helplessness memorable lines so, provides great commentary alcoholic's obnoxious nature society obsession getting next fix. The gravity Birnam's situation expressed fantastic close-ups. In scene Birnam settling drink, shown removing coat sitting sofa - Wilder almost equates Birnam's relationship alcohol sexual nature. There also scenes uses characters illustrate society's condemnation lack hope writing profession, something adds Birnam's woes makes drown sorrows even more, alcohol. What amazes little time screenplay takes establishing Birnam's condition. As film progresses linear narrative, interspersed flashbacks, Wilder guides viewer scene scene, depths Birnam fallen, get liquor. He also uses satire good effect - rehab centre named 'Hangover Plaza' regulars former advertising professionals! A special mention terrific background score - classic trademark Billy Wilder films - gives film eerie feel, unheard of, genre like this. Some scenes frightening, especially hospital scene towards end, squirming, every time I watch it. Wilder uses lights, doors, sounds Birnam's close-ups great effect. In view, biggest reason story The Lost Weekend classic, 65 years later, mankind still battling addiction, rehab centres haven’t changed treatment measures expression face man desperate next glass liquor, still same. Bravo, Mr Wilder.
