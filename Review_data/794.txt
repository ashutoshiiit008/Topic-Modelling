Some flaky, lame dialogue truth incompatibility media. Blink. Samar (Emraan Hashmi) reporter quit job, gets deal good true. Blink. Emraan Hashmi-Neha Dhupia song. Blink. Emraan Hashmi-Sagarika Ghatge song. Blink. Interval. And good way. What follows post-interval happens quickly doesn't manage create interest gone negative first half. And somehow ends lecture audience cannot handle truth. Isn't like lamest excuse producer make lousy product? That's masses, customer wants. You see, doesn't like good things - honest reporters, non-sensationalized news, good films, he's idiot all. So, here's solution - let's make consume mediocrity. Interestingly, despite attitude towards audience, makers chosen topic recently attempted Rann, behind scenes news channels. Nothing shocking comes attempt either. I would brought Wag The Dog would involve saying Dustin Hoffman Robert De Niro breath Emraan Hashmi Aditya Pancholi. So, I'll keep peace. Speaking which, actors whatever take movie forward. You don't feel sorry anyone, feel terrorized power villain. The one good thing get Rush Murli Sharma's character way played it. A delight! The women, Neha Dhupia Sagarika Ghosh, look great don't get whole lot room look anything fake. Yet, feel like theme whole lot left unexplored. Another director, another writer, actors, another film.
