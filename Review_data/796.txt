"Flat OK". - This TV channel describes graph sensex one point time movie. "Flat OK" would describe entire movie given point. Saas Bahu aur Sensex women living together apartment complex. In industry women mere props movies, heartening see someone take courage make movie everyday housewives. But, plot lifeless hardly excitement motivation get involved characters. No doubt refreshing see Kirron Kher non-Punjabi, non-loud personality. Also, Tanushree Dutta Mausameh made decent show introverted extroverted characters respectively. I surprised know lady playing Punjabi Delhi actually Sharon Prabhakar! She looked different annoyed, as, I guess, character meant do. Farouque Shaikh adorable character blushing getting frustrated alternately. Ankur Khanna managed make care character writing, especially climax particular character, unforgivably lame. So climax movie. The writing, general, incoherent make sense characters' motivations. Or, motivations plain person seems unbelievable. A representative community/geographical region picked laced stereotypes. Details place whatsoever. Things happen expected accept. The guy runs training accent neutralization call center easily bags jobs friends. Passage time really difficult follow too. You feel like events happening consecutive days, doesn't fit way laid out. Nope! It doesn't great sense humor either. It might woman power turned flimsy writing itself. Let us hope way harbinger good times ahead. The Sensex shown touch 30,000. Isn't hope need given behavior recent times?
