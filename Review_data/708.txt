Paulwaat quite instantly makes one feel though isn’t particularly novel brave, film honest story. However, apart fact technically quite amateurish, film’s biggest problem director Aditya Ingale fails inject honesty film’s treatment. The story, spite nowhere close new, strike chord. A young, middle-class man leaves settled job comes Mumbai, grand merchant dreams, pursue artistic aspirations - familiar like me, intensely personal. The film traces struggles follow relationships crafts along way. The ‘struggle’ concept protagonist, Anant, knows go through, somehow doesn’t seem fully understand. At times seems like deliberate character trait. There times, however, appears character wasn’t developed enough. The relationships gradually forges also give feeling aren’t explored completely. Chief amongst one shares spirited landlady – tough-as-nails, no-nonsense woman sad past tender heart. Then Usman bhai, veteran classical musician seen struggle throughout journey life. Their stories, though touching, seem like pages incomplete book. Technically, film leaves lot desired. The shot-taking cutting often plain shoddy. The lead actor Subodh Bhave (playing Anant) fairly decent job. The rest cast lends adequate support. The music mostly functional, sometimes pleasant, never memorable. The highlight music soulful song sung Asha Bhosale, personal favourite playback singer. Then, course, lack attention detail. Even though entire film set Mumbai, nearly 80% seems shot elsewhere, something extremely conspicuous. The silhouette shots Bandra-Worli Sea Link appear intervals simply enough. Usman bhai, supposed Hindi-speaking Muslim character hailing North India, seems distinctly Muslim North Indian. While details important cinema, still superficial level. This film’s biggest problem lies far deeper. For struggling artist/performer new Mumbai, one biggest factors contributing struggle city itself. It hard place live in, even harder make mark in. Thousands dreams swept oblivion every single day. When use public transport travel city show work men holding puppet strings, takes physical emotional toll you. These little details needed woven film visual level subtly would gently creep subconscious viewer. That contributes soul-stirring cinematic experience, sorely lacking film. The fact, then, local trains don’t find even cursory mention film easily forgiven. In end, Paulwaat ends like ordinary cup coffee mornings. It job meant do, doesn’t nearly satisfy you.
