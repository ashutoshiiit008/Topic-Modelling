'Life fair' even things don't actually turn way you'd like them. A beautiful thought, especially many us competing cynicism. But time reach conclusion Utt Patang pretty bored what's going. Because repetition; jokes might worked well paper, didn't quite get delivered; lines led joke plain could get. And that's sad. Good gags getting murdered mediocre writing over/under-acting. Here least, performers job well. Sure, Vinay Pathak goes over-the-top plays Lucky, underworld obsessed everything French - I told ya, sounds funny, isn't funny watch - hardly fault Vinay Pathak, itâ€™s way character written. Besides wonderful job Ram, though nothing haven't seen earlier. (There's particular agenda behind Vinay Pathak's double role, I liked choice names - obvious reference one favorite comedies, Golmaal.) While Saurabh Shukla usual thing round man everyone laugh at, I thoroughly enjoyed Mona Singh's performance. Her confused, zombie-like daze woman recently broken would wear. Mahie Gill sticks like sore thumb milieu. Maybe loud character, maybe bad make-up, maybe off-dubbing again, maybe it's plain bad acting. What works best way film put together. I'm talking editing transitions, non-linear narration flows back forth smoothly. And beauty even audience put together pieces order, basic plot potential maintain attention. I always disproportionately like parts films fool me. In couple scenes I cringed repetition dialogue, find later redundancy strong reason. Unfortunately, none adds film entertains enlightens gets stand character slap one. It's one films you'd watch happened playing switching channels. Such viewing might seem fair.
