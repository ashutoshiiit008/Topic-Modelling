Joker typical Akshay Kumar action-comedy. It starts looking silly, stays ends even sillier. But regular slapsticky comedy either. It cute silly. The characters obscure village Paglapur quirks would expect, react consistently character without getting repetitive. And repetition mostly enjoyable. A lot repetition tolerable perfect length film. At good 15 minutes less two hours, Joker right make goofing acceptable. The complete absence toilet humor innuendos feels fresh product like this. But Joker's humor not. The humor too, pretty situational induces hearty laughs. Unfortunately, humor fizzles Joker turns focus towards story. While trying literally bring Paglapur map, story Agastya (Akshay Kumar) company cook goes control. Which would fine genre writer, Shirish Kunder wants keep film in. But fun fizzles characters start focusing logistics how. While, logistics logic welcome story, fantasy world Paglapur – nights lit lanterns made fireflies – distract fun. Not consistency logic film – example, village remote power supply, electricity light village like it's Christmas mention mobile internet connection. And oh, dot village devoid item numbers - Maharashtrian ones that, bang middle Hindi belt. It things easy take care would added additional layer humor. And inconsistency sudden focus dry story pulls Joker down. Else, I'd shocked actually liking one. As is, I little surprised think film 'not bad'. Especially think film children adults go to, too. The storyline involving aliens kid zone, commentary Indian politics might also quick education kids what's lined years come. Except item number, course. The story fact, come across bunch kids sitting around playing, "make story" every child turn contributes one line story built right game progresses. Joker fun kind way. Also, Joker lot social commentary analogies thrown us notice. Moreover, rare chance us watch Akshay Kumar play stick character. While much serious comparison, character reminded Mohan Swades. There histrionics, slow-mo entries, glamour, super-hero attitude. He plays plain simple Agastya who's conscious suddenly wakes well village. The rest cast Shreyas Talpade playing one hilarious characters. And well-served use appropriate measure overdoing it. The men bring laughs – Vrijesh Hirjee Asrani. The women hand precious little film could pretty much done without characters. They together form fantasy land, Paglapur, might well Lilliput Gulliver's Travels. Unfortunately, doesn't end dose style humor starts with. And story childish trying maintain adult interest it. A little bit neither yet welcome change come expect Akshay Kumar film.
