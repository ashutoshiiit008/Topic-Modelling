On surface level, Mugamoodi (Mask), acclaimed director Myshkin, sure poses bland name superhero movie. Anand (a) Lee (Jiiva) man, would adorn coveted mask movie, loafer father’s eyes world consists girl. But according him, dreamer wants make big world something would require complete soul involved & 9-5 time. From many characters unlikely ones (especially Anand’s grandfather scientist), one could sense pattern sorts emerge way behave. It though Myshkin wanted make super-hero flick, dystopian characters (the ones associate earlier ventures) decided wear mask fill requisite roles super-hero flick. This could well real purpose naming movie Mugamoodi, mask Myshkin’s world wears enter super-hero world; point extensively explained song 'vaayamoodi summa iruda'. As Anand's friends start sing song would advise dazed state mind love first sight, Myshkin lets hero jump Swiss alps, ripping away roots make mere romantic number. Unfortunately, though stands picturisque location, heart still thinks talks way people world do. For super-hero movie stay mind, needs extra special writing, Myshkin somehow managed first half borrowing elements Hollywood counterparts. Albeit able accustom 'what Myshkin's brand characters set super-hero plot', movie moved-on build-up phase stepped serious 'super-hero' action, I couldn’t stand travesty. From inspired effort, film became spoof American heroes; especially fag-end tale confused whether laugh shout anger happenings screen. Looking back, warning Anand’s friends gave 'vaayamoodi summa iruda' song, could actually Myshkin, intentionally deviated roots, on, field couldn’t penetrate.
