Love... sigh... Haven't done something purely crazy believed love is? And hasn't ages since we've seen moments genuine selfless love screen. It longer since I saw characters, Hindi films especially, introspecting knowing person feels without told. Aashiqui 2 film brought things alive screen. Yet, doesn't fill gap love story sucks completely romance. Once characters Rahul Jaykar RJ (Aditya Roy Kapoor) Aarohi (Shraddha Kapoor) established, kept nagging I couldn't feel characters. Fine, broad stroke story predictable. But, every while, dialogue moment introspection makes regard character new light. Here lovers take time fall love express it. Sure, there's slow pace blamed making wait happens next. But hey, waiting happens next, film working fine. After two lovers, singers star status, one sticking going gets bad. Isn't want loved one us? Isn't we'd beloved? And came realisation! I know Aarohi RJ love other. But, I know characters say other. It's I journey theirs. That emotional connect missing. Interestingly enough, actors cannot entirely put fault this. Shraddha Kapoor's innocent face half work her. I wouldn't take away contributes actor here, charming screen presence. She brings Aarohi's simple-mindedness commitment poise. Aditya Roy Kapur good-at-heart RJ genuinely. Despite cynicism, believe selfless is. On darker side, also don't question set path self-destruction. The bits, big bits, falters tries convince us he's drunk. And that's huge let down. Shouldn't 'acting drunk' primary qualification actor able claim one? Very rarely, I feel like adding separate comment director. I believe everything happens film director's doing. So, I feel every department film-making indirectly comment work. Some tiny choices made though, added experience. The casual way funny lines pass without drawing extra attention themselves, control drama ready melodrama - name few. Yep, norm now. But, till doesn't, deserves extra mention points. The departments add ambience too. While crisp camera-work lends fresh feel film, music kept going flow film. I'm sure I would enjoy listening songs. But, worked really well within context film. The film lovely flow (except abrupt last 10 minutes) despite 15-20 minutes longer I would liked it. I must say I surprised I liked film much I did. When I saw Aashiqui teenager, I remember thinking love stories end either "happily ever after" "both die". Aashiqui 2, light moments beginning, little drama loads non-eewww romance, holds attention keeps there. It doesn't reach heart, wholeheartedly.
