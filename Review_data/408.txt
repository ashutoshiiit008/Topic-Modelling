Update: While filmmakers shooting higher frame rates quite now, first time entire feature film projected theatrically 48 frames per second, dubbed HFR projection purposes. (Currently, select INOX theatres Sathyam Chennai HFR-ready.) Experiencing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey HFR 3D pros cons. It works well action sequences shots camera movement. The higher 48 FPS frame rate means motion becomes far smoother action easier watch. However, 48 FPS also seems improve image clarity, often makes easy discern shots lighting artificial sets/VFX used. Simply put, filmmakers far careful intend continue using HFR future. More effort required seamless blend live action locations CG. As far The Hobbit concerned, complain HFR looks 'too much like video'. For most, overall experience seem far familiar enjoyable regular 24 FPS, eyes accustomed to. Personally speaking, I dismiss HFR early existence, considering I got goose-bumps exactly places watching second time round HFR, I first time I watched good ol' 24. My best friends Ron Hermione. My name, course, Harry Potter. But even I would admit ‘The Lord Rings’ arguably greatest bit fantasy writing history. Brought life Peter Jackson’s stunning vision form cinematic trilogy, films occupy rare pedestal comes films adapted literature. Now, Jackson back. With first trilogy films based The Hobbit, prequel J R R Tolkien’s famous epic, Jackson transports us back magical Middle-Earth; world dragons Dwarves, wizards Orcs. A 3D world fantasy adventure, one breathtaking engulfs you, willing let go. Bilbo Baggins Hobbit happy hole world, adventure comes knocking form Gandalf wizard motley crew Dwarves. As introduced conflict Dwarves’ history journey necessary undertake, reluctant Bilbo drawn well, barmy pack characters set intriguing hunt gold pursuit dragon Smaug. Linear fairly simplistic narrative, first film primarily acts preamble grandeur excitement adventures two subsequent films doubtlessly hold. As Gandalf mysteriously tells Bilbo, “I'm looking someone share adventure…” really asking us, viewers, join world Tolkien’s Jackson’s respective imaginations created. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey primarily held together bewitching imagery embellished remarkable 3D; film virtually transports Middle-Earth. The eccentric characters comic tone film charming, helped greatly performances. Martin Freeman takes little time shake image Watson BBC’s contemporary Sherlock adaptation slips role younger Bilbo ease. His mannerisms expressions perfect, infinitely likeable Elijah Wood, appears brief reprisal role Frodo. For hardcore LOTR fans, also cameos Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) likes, mention Andy Serkis’ deliciously twisted, motion-capture return Gollum. My personal favourite, course, Ian McKellen’s Gandalf Grey. The thespian, always, brings air mystique indefatigable character Gandalf wizard. His disappearances reappearances bring sense alternating loss reassurance, magical involvement Bilbo Dwarves depend much towering presence character has. Undeniably, film works make reminisce far frenetic heart-pounding experience earlier trilogy, film suffers one big problem hard ignore gauge objectively. While personally, leisurely pace film didn’t bother I enjoyed vicarious fantastical experience I offered, undoubtedly find pace film tedious. Only truly taken Tolkien-verse fully able appreciate film. Whether film work depends entirely much like involving experience cinema. The Lord Rings novel shy 1400 pages, took three movies make respectable cinematic adaptation it. The Hobbit, comparison, isn’t even 300 pages long still made three movies. Crudely put, ‘Hobbit’ film one-fifth much LOTR film had. The choice make three films book, then, seems financially driven creatively. After all, film certainly going rake billions worldwide. But concerns practical, rational cynical. For love living characters mentally inhabiting places enigma fantasy, An Unexpected Journey works well. The songs Dwarves, quirks lovable Hobbit, Gandalf’s immense aura obstacles face along journey enchant you. Jackson’s assured hand recreating world clearly besotted most, makes scenes set pieces truly stand out. The familiar background score, reminiscent LOTR films, aids making live world. Also, film really set things nicely The Hobbit: The Desolation Smaug The Hobbit: There Back Again. In larger scheme things, one wants revisit Tolkien-Jackson universe years later, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey would start, worthy introduction world magic adventure sucked nearly 20 hours cinema eventually experience.
