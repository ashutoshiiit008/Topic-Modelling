Unbelievable, really. Barely months Antoine Fuqua’s Gerard Butler-starrer, Olympus Has Fallen, disgraced big screen cheesy, jingoistic, all-American, guiltily indulgent ludicrousness, Roland Emmerich gives us White House Down - film with, yes, almost exact plot, asininity several notches. The White House taken terrorists, simple that. At least Olympus Has Fallen tried maintain level respect towards constitution office President United States America. White House Down, though, all-out idiocy astonishing level. It dials absolutely everything idiotic Olympus, adds puerile moments own, serves us harebrained film trips preposterousness trying outrun half-wittedness. This kind film lollipop-sucking computer hacker gets work setting Beethoven symphony, affable White House tour guide miraculously manages invoke Arnold Schwarzenegger shotgun comes way. Now Roland Emmerich never known make particularly intelligent films anyway, preferring use $100-million-plus budgets blow things making things come crashing down. Incidentally, last film Anonymous, made measly $30 million budget, seemed like beginning tilt slightly towards substance films. That one was, me, best film date despite outlandish usual work. But he’s back big-budget vengeance how! Channeling inner Abbas & Mastan, Emmerich packs plot twist minute, completely avoids space-time coherence, provides ace military-grade stealth skills eleven-year old girl, takes special care ensure none thousand-odd bullets fired heroes ever touches packs film inane humour throughout runtime; much I’m hard-pressed slot film comedy. It also pretends coming paternal-age drama times, becomes particularly hard gag. The real travesty film really fine actors given thankless characters enact. Jamie Foxx POTUS collects every ounce Barack Obama’s poise statesmanship, chew like giant bubblegum spit onto front lawn White House, ensuring carries absolutely none film. He’d made amusing sidekick janitor White House another film. As ‘leader free world’ though - refers one - best isn’t screen. Jason Clarke, coming back three terrific turns Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty The Great Gatsby, saddled negative role far beneath talent presence. Maggie Gyllenhaal goes over-the-top wish stayed dead The Dark Knight. Channing Tatum aspiring Secret Service agent who’s trying best impress daughter, offers measure macho schoolboy charm, much keep straight face what’s happening around him. White House Down kind film stop taking seriously soon, hoping turn least brisk, fun film. Alas, rarely becomes anything good exercise testing many synonyms word ‘moronic’ think of.
