500 Days Summer must circulated / rented DVD amongst Siddharth Anand, Punit Malhotra, Karan Johar types. It’s obvious film remake Indian audiences - probably starring Imran Khan. The rom-com colours, quirky screenplay, crisp editing, non-linear story-telling ability laugh itself, neat invertendo Adam Eve romance. Unlike cliches cast stone Pyar Ke Side Effects, film, Eve commitment phobic, wants relationship casual relaxed, whereas Adam emotional wants something long term. He one asks question guys scared of: “So think headed?” “Are couple?” On DVD, 500 Days Summer breezy, often humorous sometimes introspective film sit - almost perfect you’re calling date home. Right casting, apt puppy love - Joseph Gordon Levitt (Tom) Summer (Zooey Deschanel), picture post-card cinematography, odd Farah Khan-esque choreographed number (All I want you), lilting melodies soundtrack, inventive interception voice-over navigates effortlessly past present, film right freshness quotient. Director Marc Webb, helming next instalment Spiderman, interpreted script well. After long time, story love (not love story, mind you) makes think reversal roles. How would boys became cling-on, refusing move-on, commitment-desirable types girls wanted nothing serious, casual use-and-throw relationships? That’s like Harry Met Sally, upside down. Scary thought, ask me. The fact Tom woman relationship established fabulous touches. I felt really sad him. A little heartbroken. Summer’s character unique. Deschanel plays Summer T - she’s little eccentric, flirtatious long casual gaze dialogue delivery unusual I’ve seen among actresses. I’d loved screenplay added stronger back-story - The explanation given little insufficient reason make way. Why hasn’t felt love men she’s before? What made immune genuine, honest advances guy like Tom? The writers film don’t tell us this, hint possible answers. A message strongly advocate film love may real thing - exists fantasy minds expectations love fuelled pop-songs, movies romances read about. The DVD bit disappointment terms Bonus Features - extended / deleted scenes, really don’t work charms like behind-the-scenes footage would have. Webb’s direction managed immerse lives characters, interviews cast would refreshing. Sadly there’s none dope making film. The film ‘feel-good’ written - songs big help - I’d certainly classify recommended viewing.
