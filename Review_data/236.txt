With David, Bejoy Nambiar struggles gray area right wrong. Be love war - whether action right wrong, many time, becomes debatable given situation. Nambiar explores zone in-between. Unfortunately, one three tales chooses compelling half baked one. Though third one struggled dilemma, seemed like comic romantic relief take edge seriousness two. David (London, 1975 - Neil Nitin Mukhesh) part Muslim underworld family. Though part family, trusted most. Yet, family keeping personal history him. Should change alliance family? The layered three, one tears David most. The black white treatment stands good contrast David's conflict within. David (Mumbai, 1999 - Vinay Virmani) belongs lower middle-class Christian family. A local politician accuses father, priest, trying convert Hindus Muslims. David's struggle common man much like situation common man today, decade later. The build one David's quest family suffering kept intrigued. However, loses steam towards end. The way culminates though resonated me. David (Goa, 2010 - Chiyaan Vikram) Goan village's outcast wife left wedding altar. Other fact, makes sense, I believe human race's capacity hold one person's misfortunes him. The simplest one David miserable friendship love. But, somehow ground left uncovered gets diverted humor shuffles dark, slapstick quirky. One David's main problems length. Though three stories tell, times film feels like little place. The thing holding together awesome performance across board. From three main leads Monica Dogra, Tabu, Saurabh Shukla people possesses, right upto Rohini Hatangadi - give play bits conviction. There one thing I begun love Bejoy Nembiar's films. The way picturizes songs. The unlikely songs set brutal action sequences yet sound look beautiful. Of course, rest film slick classy touch it. The good news feeling I got Shaitan film vehicle showcase "cool" things ever wanted films, reduced. So, yet again, I left looking forward next film. If only, hold film together. As far connection three Davids goes, one David doesn't let go character sticking roots. The third one, well he's waiting noticed one David. Let's say this, three connected I. I write read, read I write. We connected cosmic energy between. Call fate, call God's will.
