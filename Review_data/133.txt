I guess every star worth salt typical potboiler name - one makes sense plot-wise, insists claiming one; one likes believe entertains toilet sex humor; one lame song every 15-20 minutes. Besharam film Ranbir Kapoor. The worst bit doesn't typical stuff conviction. Everything villain's tyranny hero's unabashed personality via lead lady's pretentiousness seems well calculated squeezed fit formula. What's more, must first Ranbir Kapoor's films cannot forget screen. It doesn't help parents feature film couple; even though three together Ranbir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor Neetu Singh best infuse energy spark-less script. It comic timing brings laughs dialogue allow. That besides, pretty much made fools couple scenes. Pallavi Sharda's presence doesn't bring sparkle either. Javed Jaffrey adds well-known poor puns. Then again, maybe blame reserved writing department. I sat feeling pretty much insulted makers thought would go story/characters/dialogue us, audience. It's predictability different worlds Mr. Besharam's personality come together lack peak point. It much feeling minimum effort put thinking attributes. Even action sequences songs rather generic. Sure, attempt fresh including bold crass dialogue. You also typical film references strewn across - Sholay DDLJ course, Dabangg. But, lines work overall plot run-down couple decades ago? A soft-cornered Robin Hood-like hero; woman easily falls guy putting oh-so-much resistance; comic relief track. In fact, mix worsened uninterested villain. Maybe people watch Ranbir Kapoor anything good laugh one. But, star's fans justice talent liking films wouldn't want star associated with, general?
