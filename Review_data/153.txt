Haven't overdose movies based religious fanaticism associated terrorism already? May not...Okay, haven't share stories told mundane fashion? I say enough already! First credit it's due. The base story bad all. It interesting plot-twists. The sub-plots sort-of flowed too!! The thing I enjoyed music. Unfortunately, list stops here. The battle completely lost filling-in details. The characters cannot called underdeveloped, unbelievably one-dimensional. One character shot plot character could done something interesting. It hard digest character behaves exact way friendly someone close relative passes away. Even modern-day Gandhi. How one speechlessly grieving shock one moment lecturing tolerance other. Almost character spieling speech speech either tolerance intolerance, doesnâ€™t help either. Each lecture consists old, mind-numbing lines. Each line repeated begs us thankful two different sentences saying thing. Because times, words repeated - asking us sympathetic towards dialogue writer creatively-challenged. And one character certainly shouldn't encouraged "poet" grandfather figure. The lyrics inane, sir, let alone inspirational. Anil Kapoor certainly wider range expressions this. Anurag Sinha again, great voice monotonous style delivering dialogues. Shefali Chaya admired trying best maintain composure playing rather loud character. I would still blame character development lackluster performances. They good reason pick tone stick - script variation character! There one redeeming factor whole set-up - seen much, much worse Subhash Ghai
