Mental check-list walking theater neutralize skepticism created promos - 10...9... It's Dharma productions - nagging feeling must caught violently contagious disease that's air days called self-referencing. So make peace Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham Kuch Kuch Hota Hai whenever show up. 8...7...6... You'll entering lives super-happy, super-rich people - even express anger smile. Don't jealous them. Breathe, don't fume. 5...4... Expect tasteless gay jokes - exist test tolerance, meditation courses meant for. 3...2...1... Don't complain songs random, it's Miami beaches goodness sake, try understand, need excuse show beautiful ladies off... ...Boom... Not moment wasted...some random song digitally enhanced voices extra blue skies. But also Shilpa Shetty literally Abhishek Bachchan (Sam) John Abraham (Kunal). Just one complain. All boys house need gorgeous, barely-clad woman drool over. And girls take pick - John 'Perfect V' Abraham swim beach casually dressed Abhishek nodding head style. Though apprehensions mentioned appropriately done justice to, lot mental preparation seemed worked. Because I pleasantly surprised hear laugh regular intervals - Thanks situations created brilliant timing Abhishek Bachchan. However, John back part furniture far acting goes. Sure jokes intended take advantage way audience laughs gay people. But, situations places made funny. No credit dialogues though. Their function remind us cool enough use word 'gay' openly - every 10th minute. Anyway, like good things, laughter soon dried too, largely due repetition. And stop using 'brother another mother' line already! It amazing simple, sweet concept completely ruined keeping narrative absolutely flat. The superficial conflict treated ever lightly can't let superfluous drama get involved. Sam Kunal get annoyed, anxious, jealous, apologetic turn perfect arseholes (what else people use Taare Zameen Par manipulate children called?) exact time. Was one character conception stage split two give gay angle? And course there's necessity show single bonding moment males, similar. Neha (Priyanka Chopra) shade detailed character. But even details seem tokens rather serving arc. Yet, Priyanka sincerely expresses whatever Neha going through. This fourth movie year yet brings freshness screen. There's something superbly charming warm way carries herself. Can't blame Neha's feelings don't logical flow one moment cares job soon enough barely matters. Fluidity general lacking around here. I'm talking characters transforming preachy one-liner (remember deep breathing exercises show?). Itâ€™s absence even one-liner. I'll thank climax eye exercises helped - much eye-rolling I haven't done long long time. The focus mockery here. Mockery gay behave perceived too. Mockery parents react know child homosexual blinding love really be. A movie relationships friendships, yeah right! Not one.
