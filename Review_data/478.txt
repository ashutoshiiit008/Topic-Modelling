A friend friend friend. He moral support, come may. To extent, Jhootha Hi Sahi true-to-life enjoyable. Like group friends, one bunch below-the-belt insults store yet they'll watch ridiculous situations. This initial set-up hilarious mucho fun. But, set aside almost everything superficial, improbable, many-a-time outright stupid. Even ignore everything else that's wrong Jhootha Hi Sahi, songs (every, single thing them) climax , unfortunately turn-offs HUGE enough make dislike whole film. The crisp dialogue, delivery, slapstick timing simply brilliant film starts. Yes, I laughed loud typical slapstick. And I director thank brilliant actors brought eye roll predictable slapstick. Of course, actors bit too. Else, would've thought John Abraham would make laugh him? But happens preaching philosophy flitting like butterfly (I shall NOT elaborate). Anyhow, every while, others "quote day" type lines deserve got cringe more. The others actors well banter-type lines go friends. But, Anaitha Nair Alishka Varde fit perfectly kind girl-friends I'd like have, spirited always bring smile! Pakhi hand, doesn't necessarily ooze charm. But it's refreshing non-glam, non-wannabe-size-zero female lead. She play character written, Mishka. While I don't know whether made easy difficult her, I appreciated Mishka grew woman wasn't defined men life. Also thematically, delight see inclusive attitude towards homosexual community. Not non-trivial gay characters, Mishka also shown going "aaawwww" fleeting moment song sees lesbian couple. Heartening beyond measure. Besides close-to-life, normal characters, script ranged random sub-plots uninhibitedly absurd. There characters stories, motivations unknown actions unjustified. There's girlfriend doesn't seem care supposedly love there's friend doesn't want marry guy she's love with. When nothing comes sub-plots, look like mere props grander scheme things. In fact, partly true main character, Siddharth, well. The film makes wonder whether friend, Omar know (let alone why) falls love? Then again, maybe that's cool too, mere reflection confused 'gen x'?
