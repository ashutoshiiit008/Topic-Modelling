Deep friendships. Friends take advantage you. We least couple types. Rangrezz makes brave effort showing sides unlike used seeing Bollywood. Unfortunately, slacks times takes easier beaten-down route redeem little later - leading uneven second half extremely dissatisfying conclusion. Rangrezz starts collage beautiful Mumbai monsoons heavily grey, tone pretty much resembling Mumbai looks like season. My surprise began initial shots. A little later colors unwarranted close-ups come in, I back comfortable movie began looking like I expected. And yet again, I pleasantly pulled set-up - characters, relationships, wit charm. Some dark humor really took cake. This involvement rudely disrupted songs. Once mandatory numbers done with, meat story began engagingly narrated wonderful peak interval. After break too, interesting twists catch off-guard. Amazingly enough, largely unpredictable feel cheated. You see signs twist earlier, don't think much it. Only problem though twists balanced equally inane typical turn events. This wavelike movement writing gets annoying completely blotched end. Thankfully, dialogue end writing department taken job seriously come hilarious witty lines. Completely supported able delivery given - Vijay Verma (Pakkya) Rajpal Yadav (Maa). Jacky Bhagnani's dubbing doesn't help attempts emote. I broke laughing supposedly intense scene Jacky Bhagnani speaking yet camera uncharacteristically, safe, crane top angle. The women mostly redundant - either snubbed over-protected men around. Amongst rest cast Amitosh Nagpal (Winu), Lushin Dubey (Mrs. Chaturvedi) Pankaj Tripathi (Pande) leave impression, especially considering limited screen-time have. The wonderful bit characters stick entertain despite caricatures - Vijay Pakkya, Maa Mrs. Chaturvedi. Or even cute, petite grandmom. Another bit, I really enjoyed Rangrezz couple main threads left unresolved matter factly manner. It's great makers decided keep details out, especially considering film already little long. (Why cut songs out!) Unfortunately, Rangrezz insists becoming message film. The extremity intensity film narrated almost makes wonder autobiographical - events chart imagined. Yet, Rangrezz ends making wonder people relationships. So, many turn events film, make nod - "yep, unbelievable looks, happen." Maybe, it's I didn't expect maturity Jacky Bhagnani film, preconceptions hailed! But, I looking forward next Priyadarshan film, case decides go whole length make film bogged need songs filmy.
