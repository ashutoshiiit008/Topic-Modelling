The good news film doesn't suffer first half-second half syndrome. The bad news follows bell-curve. It starts real bad, gets interesting, peaks ends jiffy rather sloppily. Fortunately, film sprinkled dialogues witty crisp. The set-up ordered over-dose everything - extra aggressive landlord asks extra rent extra small place; extra-ordinarily hostile work environment immediately reminds Rocket singh; exceptionally mild protagonist Karthik (Farhan Akhtar) everyone throws around. O-kay, got point. So low Karthik's life way go up. By despite exaggeration, begin care him. You want slap people around - real hard. And does. 40 minutes 140 minuter done with. This gets interesting. Obviously, thriller thriller can't tell character going this. But, I like ones can't tell despite staring face. Of course, anyone guess 95% what's happening, next 5% comes surprise. Unfortunately, though should've gone "aaaah, like that" moment feel "blah!" mystery unfolds. However, romantic relationship Karthik Shonali (Deepika Padukone) explored quite detail extremely engaging. It touches upon girls wanting nice safe guys misbehave. :) The contrast two characters set-up nicely too. One avoids mobile phones invented plague health. The smokes. One enters office along cleaners, around lunch-time. Despite romance believable done jiffy compared pace rest film. Farhan plays simple man whose world revolves around job love interest (no rhyming words nokri aur chhokri English) perfection. In mind, he's still director, see man act want see every project he's involved in. The best bit Karthik gets loop falls self-fulfulling prophecy. What confusing entire world plain clear him. Deepika good job playing hesitation Shonali goes getting relationship And bit consistent writing too, nothing left explore character. Except, times, shifts gear she's talking child. Even "I love you"s! The film exaggerated tone gray gloomy situations, makes use ambience bit face. So use Rubik's cube. True used motif metaphor what's happening Karthik. But things supposed left interpretation shoved audience's throat. Let's even get hurried way technical aspects subject handled - rush hoping audience won't notice. Like I said, I'd watch film Farhan's performance. And don't forget concept half-interesting. It's bit long yet left unexplained.
