Rang Rasiya bold. Not one scene sex nudity, also theme(s) picks narrative they've chosen depict concepts. For itself, Rang Rasiya could watched avid film buff. However, beyond that, comes across mish-mash themes, trying say none getting enough space it. Randeep Hooda misunderstood, controversial painter strong lead. I come love choice films growing strength performer. Sure, still comes across repetitive across films brooding characters. But, Rang Rasiya gives little width expression thrives. Nandana Sen gorgeous gives character fullest too. For once, lead lady character Hindi film used body, yet doesn't look sleazy doesn't seem like objectification. The credit course goes writing story. Unfortunately though, chemistry two leads seems forced. The intimate scenes though much explicit thus seemingly natural also come across self-conscious. In fact, said film whole. The makers aware trying something different, pretentious self-consumed, awareness shows. This doesn't let get involved audience. Also, narrative episodic thus allowing smooth flow one scenario another. That fluidity utmost importance film attempts poetic. And film, subject matter deserves poetic too. For one, set period 100 years ago. That era lends romanticization own, wasn't capitalised completely. To top off, painter wishes express things world around ready for. What could lend lyricism film? Also, alone good enough make full length feature film. However, issues related gender roles, freedom, value art creator, philanthropy, religion brought realm creating potpourri doesn't blend well together. Not mention, thread feels like left midway. I open-ended stories, seemed unintentional. I would still watch Rang Rasiya, it's trying do. The hope bold themes, creases ironed give us wholesome, less self-aware film. Till then, decent enough start.
