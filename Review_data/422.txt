Noises apartment society made Raj Puri (Sushant Singh) cranky man. This irritability introduced wife, Abha (Kartikadevi Rane) new facet personality. The crabbiness egged middle-class secretary society, Janardhan (Rajat Kapoor), take pride implementing safety measures causing crankiness. Repeat. Repeat. And repeat more. With round though, aggravation increased. A piece anyone's life - noises replaced irritant cause tiffs apartment complexes. But, repetition made lazy even yawn. Sure, simplicity plot Hrishikesh Mukherjee feel it, style narration. But Hulla misses big time keeping engaged. Though, underlying commentary sham security systems amusing, staying attentive throughout effort. And I assume intended light smile-your-way-through comedy, smiles occasional. None blamed lead cast. The noises begin annoying viewer despite Raj's clearly unreasonable demands. Thanks pained expression Sushant consistently carries. It's fascinating watch man behind pain, Rajat Kapoor. Watching struggling businessman not-so-affluent background refreshing looked like enjoying difference too. The casting two really creative worked, paper anyone would tempted swap them. Hail versatility! Kartikadevi absolutely comes across combination girl-next-door cum career-minded woman cum home-maker. And 74-year old Chandrachoor Karnik, ever-obedient watchman, reminded Shaikh chacha, watchman building, would always nod head instructions. But, rest cast came across caricatures. They sketchy representatives 'type' person apartment complex would have. The writing surely looked flimsy compared lead cast. It obvious fairly low-budget movie relatively low-profile cast out-of-focus scenes every while. And yet, something different tried. Interestingly, though, another "housing society + stock exchange" themed movie released day! Anyway, urge tell simple story well. It might succeeded completely time. Come on, much another person's boring problem I expected watch? But I'm sure movie-makers, especially writers learn follies meanwhile members audience like truly learn deal ennui.
