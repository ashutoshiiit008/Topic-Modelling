You settled life, kids well themselves. You set enjoy life carefree. And boom life hits you. You asked come-of-age again. Club 60 might come across film one man, also goes tell he, troubles tragedy unique all. Just like look around, see like you, everyone problems. They choose deal differently. There something delightful films take topics related elderly - glamorous Baghbaan way, like Listen Amaya way. Especially, charming actors like Farouque Shaikh Sarika play lead roles. Not make characters believable, make care them. And even norm, know difficult come Hindi films. Yet again, Sarika one scene completely bowls brings lump throat more. I look forward every film Farouque Shaikh chooses do, films interesting. And unfair may sound, could sleepwalk role Taariq Club 60. Raghuveer Yadav plays Munna bhai great finesses. While playing sleazeball must one easiest actor's range talent, playing sleazeball convinces good-naturedly right first scene rare one. And doesn't come across inconsistent all. And yet performances best thing Club 60. A pleasant surprise Sharat Saxena Tinu Anand. The characters play could easily become caricatures. Yet, avoided finesse see go highs lows unexpected grace dignity. So much fine performance Satish Shah side-lined. Where Club 60 suffers - low-budget-induced-production-values - writing. It gets little repetitive, film stretches good 15-20 minutes long. The situations created characters becomes tad stereotypical. Even so, cannot help want know you've grown care them. They remind parents group friends. Alas, climax little dramatized drastic tone film maintains first two hours. For many, film might good enough TV watch, I couldn't help giving extra nudge heart takes make film like this. One takes understanding, even slightly patronizing, look generation that's hill.
