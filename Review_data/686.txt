This film Bombay, Mumbai. It's story smuggler, lady love sidekick, it's rather filmy story. The movie set Bombay 70s, Bombay slowly becoming financial capital country, Bombay home everything filmy: including underworld. Everything movie larger life, dialogues almost verse-like, clothes loud (it's 70s!), heroine's makeup loud vivid romanticism powerful don. The power play slick narrative takes audience roller coaster ride one man's rise, another man's fall strong attempt stylish it. The movie told us eyes DCP Agnel Wilson (Randeep Hooda), tells us Sultan Mirza, powerful arrived Mumbai sea small innocent boy, grew become good-hearted don. It clear Sultan Mirza owns city, loves city calls Mehbooba. Which helps poor becomes god like figure them. The character Sultan Mirza precise Ajay Devgan plays utmost conviction. He good job we've seen play similar character Company still manages bring sense freshness character. Through DCP Agnel Wilson's memory told Sultan's rise power, respects city smuggling material goods drugs, love story film star Rehana (Kangana Ranaut) discovery Shoaib (Emraan Haashmi). His love story filmy gets, corny courtship period lasts 3 minutes, cheesy dialogues song/dance routine albeit mature fading larger context film. Kangana demure looks part 70s film star bling glitz. Emraan hand, plays younger Dawood Ibrahim sincerity. He cheeky, arrogant smooth ways, serves good contrast mature Sultan Mirza. His determination rule Mumbai become greatest power, gives us dramatic look see now, form international terrorism via Dawood Ibrahim. The problem film comes seems much build king sidekick, seen brilliantly Company. Both character Sultan Shoaib built well, conflict acted much intermission. More emphasis given punch lines dialogues, get tiring point. As audience member, expect action dialogues, first half seems promising, latter part film, including climax, don't match decently carved first half. Kangana's character takes backseat, Ajay Devgan becomes repetitive Emraan becomes cheeky slave power, point belief. The performances immaculate go overall feel film, doesn't seem stale convinces parts. Randeep Hooda raw change, confidence police officer, Ajay Devgan Emraan Hashmi cogent parts, film loses edge script creates void it's hurried climax falling second half. Even though movie dramatic, points dialogues become theatrical. Kangana seems sparkly filled potential suddenly loses screen presence rush make drama narrate-able story. The background score appealing, music seems bit forgettable. The movie's obvious strong points Ajay Devgan, apt characterization good story could churned better climax. Watch Once Upon A Time In Mumbai love Bombay, Ajay Devgan, entertaining story don't expect blown away.
