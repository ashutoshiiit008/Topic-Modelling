When I first watched Mike Nichol’s Closer, I remind also directed film likes The Graduate Who’s Afraid Virginia Woolf. While former rather one-dimensional narrative relationship younger man older woman, latter plays around idea complex relationships involving two couples, breaking moulds structure. To me, stood perfect backdrop Closer, also explores complex inter-mingling relationship two couples. And yet somehow, Closer also trying break security blanket simplicity, viewer. Alice (Natalie Portman) Dan (Jude Law) meet street bizarre manner, owing instant attraction. A year later, Dan moved writing obituaries writing book Alice, stripper grow her, realize she’s vulnerable, complex individual little much love drama. He meets Anna, photographer, (Julia Roberts) publicizing book, photographs portfolio. In sinister setting, Dan pretends Anna lewd chat room lures Larry (Clive Owen), who’s dermatologist, meet aquarium. Each individual character explores personal relationship one another, chance meetings, forced interactions sexual relationships aren’t left explanations. Why, ask? Because Closer doesn’t claim explore labels; like monogamy, morality suchlike. While it’s film complexity human relationships, question trying ask not, "Why would Dan sleep Anna Alice?" "On basis chart liaisons?" It becomes extremely difficult move beyond characterization Closer. The film shot beautifully, tight shots angles incorporated suit mood scene. You move dislike fondness four characters portrayed – visually emotionally. While Portman Alice naïve childishly thespian, Anna quite opposite inability express inner recesses mind. Julia Roberts brilliantly cast silently volatile role like Anna. Dan catches mysterious charm Anna exudes, chooses express bits pieces Larry him. Larry like typical savior. He moves security blanket possessive maniac. It becomes gripping visual see (as characters) switch roles. Closer character driven film. My personal favorite character remains Alice. She’s young, brings every baggage young person carries: Naiveté translates harsh judgments impulsive decisions. Impulsiveness translates disregard anything logical – one pleases, even means taking hurtful path, want to. The beauty film, lies ability move back forth, every character’s motivations. While there’s plot boast of, background score perfectly layered deep, suit mood film. While soundtrack film largely minimal soothing, using artists like Jem, Lisa Hannigan The Smiths, ‘The Blower’s Daughter’ signature line, “I can’t take eyes you” becomes like anthem movie. Because end it, every connection, every bit complexity, every infidel association every emotion derived basic bottom-line instinct. It’s simple strong able take eyes someone – whether want not. The DVD Closer interview director Mike Nichols, talks motivations adapt film 1997 play name. It also includes theatrical trailer music video Damien Rice’s ‘Blower’s Daughter’. In way, Closer lot like Alice’s personal character. It’s film – reasons given decisions actions characters take. No analyses actions define themselves, life isn’t easy. It’s impulsive film, one endorses multiplicity many forms – relationships, thought structure. But disclaimer.
