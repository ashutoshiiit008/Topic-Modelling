Drum roll And year's "Most dedicated profession" award goes to.....meetu. drum doesnâ€™t know stop rolling. Just like people involved movie know stop rolling camera - well, shouldn't even started. Had made movie, would saved trouble reading following 350+ words. But, ain't happening, I went, I saw, I wrote. So now, read. No-no, I wouldn't claim award sitting whole movie. That I immense capacity - call masochist. I deserve I gall let world know I watched this, I also spending another hours writing it. I deserve something special return!! Okay, I give humble self break. Hopefully time energy earned respect skip movie. Calling movie slapstick offense. Do pee-gases-poop-jokes really make even slapstick-lovers laugh? Are falling people, water fights, mistaken identities amusing make entire movie it? By way, anyone even consider real dialogues versus actors seem come stand-up acts? How I longed single song - however bad, however inappropriately placed! Especially would meant taking screen time 15-minute-long people-hiding-in-closets-sequence another 15-minute passing-the-treasure-game. We would fools expect story took 45 minutes introduce dozen half "characters". Vijay Raaz actor made attempt performance. The rest basking glory over-acting, oblivious world wanted ears, hair, brains intact. Of late, general, even overall bad movie good camerawork, editing, sound design. Not here! Close-ups close least one character face chopped - lower-lip downward. I noticed least two cuts mid-sentence Raju Srivastav speaking camera reason other. The characters yelling top voices able even notice noises. Don't worry guys, I realize I haven't absolutely selfless here. I watched movie I to. I told world I watched I wanted award. I wrote review length one needs outlet one's frustration.
