You would think 7.1 IMDB rating cast line-up including Vinne Jones (Lock, Stock Two Smoking Barrels) good enough reason pick film – film secretive riddles going back Charles Dickens. When I picked DVD The Riddle I thought myself, nail-bitter. My nails bitten anyway, that’s I bored – therefore I present disclaimer. Don’t Never judge book cover. Having said – let allow get blown away synopsis, also gripping part film. The Riddle contemporary mystery thriller sparks woman’s murder, finds unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript. We see film eyes Mike (Vinne Jones) aspiring investigative journalist. While tracking script, escalated world yesterday, unlock mystery yesterday, able solve today’s crime. Unlike seems The Riddle labyrinthine pace, everything folds one another quick succession. After sitting film sounds positively intelligent, keep wondering you’ve missed something, maybe you’re getting layers all. All thoughts vanish climax. I wouldn’t call joke, you’ve pulled together almost 2 hours, you’re hoping redeemed revelation end – get zilch. It’s almost ridiculous true. The film could passable writers taken little less seriously – maybe made genuine thriller follows simple pattern establishing-churning-revealing. On hand, The Riddle get absorbed arrogance, sunken deep think fabulous story. Vinne Jones tad bit wasted, although acting seems earnest. The look feel film match era (with production design costumes) deep blacks grungy hues. Sadly you’d able notice move past ghastly play events film offer. And therefore, writing main problem The Riddle. The crime scenes fairly played well, sound effects background score. It could half decent film writing cross-checked development stage. The extra DVD extended trailer film, honestly best part entire DVD. The trailer crisp, sounds looks good core concept film perfection. My humble suggestion would remake film, taking trailer making coherent, tight mildly entertaining points. Not one needs elements enjoy film, plot it’s necessary carry add-ons. It’s hard task offer critique film fundamentally wrong. You don’t know deconstruct go deep layers offer suggestions. But one main reasons I decided go bring crucial point everyone’s attention. Some bad films never made films interesting concepts problem mostly lies execution. The Riddle belongs latter category. Also, future reference, please evaluate film rating.
