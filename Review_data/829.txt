Well, well, I never thought I would live see day. Jackie Chan lead role film indulge comedy Kung fu either? Surprise, surprise, looks like Mr Chan fag end career wants known artiste acting ability instead kung fu clown! The Shinjuku incident drama illegal Chinese immigrants. The theme Chinese immigrants struggle familiar one Hong Kong cinema; remember Return Dragon, much fiery Fist Fury, starring Kung Fu legend Bruce Lee? In films, Lee arrives help fellow Chinese; first one struggle run restaurant Rome second come conflict Japanese. Both films action films, Fist Fury, possibly Bruce Lee’s greatest film, showcasing coiled body lightning fast martial arts moves. Jackie Chan subdued droopy Shinjuku incident; adopts despondent woebegone persona throughout rarely smiles. His performance average, one gets slightly tired despair, climax indulges lot shouting, go well. The first half film tries set main characters, unfortunately barring one two, none fleshed well. We remember Japanese cop, Inspector Kitano, Jie. The screen play tries weave many elements immigrants’ lives; desperation struggle money, well threats challenges face. Somehow come together cleanly, seems bit forced artificial. The first half film also feels quite incongruous; maybe need time adjust Jackie Chan different role, possibly frames bright, clean, plastic, even sought portrayed grime dirt city’s mean streets. The intercutting present bucolic past could also another factor. The dubbed dialogue English help either. The film picks dispensed initial relationship building; sense director far comfortable film enters crime territory. The story moves along quite brisk pace, detailing machinations power play ensue. The transition Jackie Chan’s character dealt sequences, really completely believable. A love interest also present seems remarkable coincidence, Bingbing Fan plays Lily, seems resemble Nora Miao (Bruce Lee’s heroine three Hong Kong films). The climax film’s strength, shot low light grainy frames (possibly serve contrast came earlier), violent, brutal, poignant. Swords thrust throats, knives used casually sever stab, stones bludgeon kill. Brian De Palma’s Scar Face immigrants’ distortion American dream; film neither intensity performances grip viscerally make lament tragic hero. It tries hard, instead remains average. It worth watch though, simply Jackie Chan’s attempt go “serious”. PS And Jackie Chan’s first sex scene what? Blink miss it!
