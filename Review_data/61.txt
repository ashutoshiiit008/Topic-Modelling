Note meetu - Diwali Fridays one worst dilemmas. wogma vs. family - couple high-profile films year versus annual extended family get-together? Invariably, I end choosing family. After all, many Fridays one Diwali year. Handing Ideasmith, who's reviewing Action Replayy me. Thanks ton! Means much! Wish crackling Diwali brighter year ahead! If fan 70s pop culture, ‘retro’ sounds like home you, please don’t watch Action Replayy – might tempted destroy furniture. If sci-fi buff still hold promise Bollywood, I suggest look elsewhere. But bright colours, loud noises easy gags entertain you, Action Replayy might work you. Just don’t expect another Om Shanti Om. In ways, Action Replayy fitting Diwali release, considering volume turned movie. Think blinding pyschedelia Eastman colour crescendo-style background scores frequent melodrama scenes. The movie starts run, everything speeded up, figure might story get main meaty blast past. Once there, plot loses pace runs spoofy moments vaguely reminiscent 70s cinema, like exaggerated caricatures extreme proclamations (“No love marriage!”). The trouble spoof lack authenticity. Considering subject age rich iconography abundant pop culture references, Action Replayy woefully tacky depiction. Coverage superficial, sticking crazy hairstyles explosion polka-dots every scene. For first half movie, sheer novelty time travel, cinematic flourishes switching Eastman colour, vibrancy retro-style Bombay keep engaged. The scene Bunty (Aditya) first looks around gets bearings 70s’ Bombay carries predictably nicely. After interval, mixed references, lack coherent plot jerky pace start grate bit. There saving grace chase sequence end, true 70s cinema complete action, comedy romance. Akshay Kumar hams Kishen ‘Kitchen’ Kumar, loser-turned-stud fits well enough movie type. Aishwarya Rai’s character seems gone astray since starts shrewish, morphs impish, detours bully tomboy finally dissolves maudlin. Om Puri Kiron Kher look like real blast extreme funny roles. A talented actor like Rajpal Yadav sadly wasted sort role usually reserved Johnny Levers Jaspal Bhattis current day Bollywood. Randhir Kapoor Neha Dhupia make blink-and-you-miss-it appearances. The real surprise movie newcomer Aditya Roy Kapur navigates jerky plot ease, holding superbly senior actors (everybody else). Rannvijay Singh may presence may really hard tell he’s hidden behind scary facial hair, styling acting (possibly throwback chest-rubbing aura yesteryear Ranjit). The incomplete visual references aside, music disappoints too, bad music key aspect Bollywood film-making would expected deliver past versus present front. Most doesn’t fit style era, terms melody, lyrics, instrumentation even choreography. At times, even even blunders 80s-style bling 60s-age nasal voices. Other credits theme beginning, none songs fit situations, all. If I sound disappointed, it’s I know much could done even within limited dimensions movie. Even going gag-ridden, cardboard-character spoof, budgets might better used research little deeper story better thought out. Instead, seemed gone flashy promos trailers cull high points movie. Everything else bright colours loud noises. Still, Diwali all, I suppose timepass derived those.
