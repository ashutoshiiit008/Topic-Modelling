No doubt, action sequences aerial shots enjoyed big screen. But, barring these, isn't anything spectacular execution. In fact, good many departments mediocre - acting, dialogues, set design. And I even talking less superficial things like character tension build-up. The screenplay Race seems race at, least, couple levels. (Sorry, use "race" irresistible!). At one level, one sub-plot waiting chop action soon previous one done. At another, sequence trying outdo terms "gotcha! You didnâ€™t see coming now, ya?" The narrative interesting till maintained scheme letting audience know little characters movie. Later becomes regular "Guess who's bigger fool?" audience too. And way, take fair guess coming. If it's going obvious, it's going opposite obvious, go. The good thing though women actual role scheming. Don't worry guys - Bipasha, Katrina Sameera - won't let skin show. They great emoting. Anyway story devious minds emotions. You don't really feel men either. They engrossed outsmarting forget feel deceit love. There one-off expression Akshaye Khanna makes laugh - intentionally, intentionally, it's alright. It funny, see actors complementing other's acting skills screen. Just case one else that?The Karamchand-Kitty gig mimicked Anil Kapoor-Sameera Reddy rather tedious monologue Johnny Lever. The dialogues sound labored. A lot labor seems gone searching internet sms jokes. Then laboriously forced flow story. The one-liners range adult, 18 years old, sexual-innuendo adult. The action sequences weren't fresh either. The one introducing Saif Ali Khan, climax, executed really well, there's nothing unique stunningly creative them. I absolutely enjoyed aerial shots. Especially, winding roads (South Africa, supposedly) backdrop rugged terrain indeed make feel like whizzing past them. And it's Ferrari, who's complaining? What seemed rather amateurish, especially considering high budget movie, art design. Good thing lot outdoors. From hospital South Africa tacky signboards said "Department Home Affairs" "Stallion". Even movies shoestring budget better that. Or song "Khwab dekhe jhootha mootha" ugly pink stars background reminded shabby set Marigold. "Pehli nazar" always sounded good and, sans Atif Aslam face every 4th second, looks good too. The title song "zara zara" foot-tapping numbers. And purpose, see. They strategically placed twist/turn/roll tale. So, audience ruminate recent events story. Another purpose dutifully serve, course, promote movie. And whoever chose songs would go promos great job. Because songs didn't make really awful - "dekho nashe mein" "Khwab dekhe jhootha mootha". Having said that, I must say something movie made work overall. I don't know exactly what. Because department major flaw other. It maybe departments synergized well enough let general "one-time watch" feel. Save couple stunts many aerial shots Race doesn't really warrant trip theaters. If director duo, woken middle night asked, "Ultimately, won Race?" They going flummoxed. Or maybe not...they might say, "Dude, WE DID!!!" Because, we, audience love cheap thrills hasn't anything glossy around quite time. So compelled flock box-office. Oh well, it.
