The great Orson Welles (Citizen Kane) famously remarked Vittorio De Sica’s Shoeshine, “It camera disappeared, screen disappeared. It life (unfolding front audience).” You certainly get feeling watching Shoeshine, considered one first cinematic gems pioneer neo-realism movement films. Neo-realism, learnt college, individual victim system, although tries revolt find way around it, hits roadblock becomes desperate eventually nailed down. My first brush neo-realism The Bicycle Thieves, film I slept first time I saw it, second viewing I liked much, I became De Sica fan life. That’s made look Shoeshine films. One may say majboori ka doosra naam Vittorio De Sica, one rare film-makers captured desperation helpless unemployed heart wrenching stories. Shoeshine (Ragazzi) revolves around two young boys - Pasquale Maggi (Franco Interlenghi) Guiseppe Fillipucci (Rinaldo Smordoni) - shine shoes living collected enough money buy horse. However, series unfortunate events lands juvenile prison, circumstances separate them, also pit other. It’s touching story consequences war innocence children first casualty. It’s theme even Iranian film-maker Bahman Ghobadi’s touched upon Turtles Can Fly. Shoeshine however uses much mature brush depict unsuspecting kids become pawns larger criminal set-up accentuates violence lives. De Sica doesn’t show things Madhur Bhandarkar way - there’s sensationalism things - Orson Welles puts - simply see life prison unfolding. Personally, I’m sucker prison dramas (The Shawshank Redemption favourite film, ever) although Shoeshinedoesn’t make startling revelations life behind bars, certainly showcases mundane mundane be. What makes look convincing fantastic direction De Sica cast non-actors, strategy he’s adopted earlier The Bicycle Thieves. It makes sympathise lot easily tears character sheds, laugh dark humour feel upset way things finally turn out. Shoeshine wasn’t commercial success - I doubt neo-realistic films ever make profit, social documentation impeccable make profound statement society, evils victims. Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, another neo-realistic masterpiece example, wasn’t box-office hit. But like films genre, attained cult status years. The film, however win first ever Oscar Best Foreign Language Film went inspire many reforms way post-war Italy treated children. That’s reason enough celebrate film.
