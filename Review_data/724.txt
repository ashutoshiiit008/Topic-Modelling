The commonly believed theory adaptations books don’t really turn good films, come reality check, dig deeper sheer amount regional literature successfully adapted screen. I’ve salivated much Satyajit Ray’s debut film Pather Panchali (adapted Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay’s novel). I spent last week admiring another Ray’s gems - Pratidwandi, one based novel Sunil Ganguli. Part Satyajit Ray’s Calcutta Trilogy - Seemabaddha (Company Limited) Jana Aranya (The Middleman) two followed - film wonderful chronicle Calcutta 1970s, eyes unemployed intellectual, Siddhartha (Dhritiman Chatterjee), college drop-out struggling find job. The film beautifully captures frustrations, insecurities, ideals clings to, even people around seem slowly find footing ‘doers, thinkers’. Ray also shows grasp changing gender equation times, observed qualified (and let’s say attractive) women would find job quite easily men. Siddhartha’s sister, Sutapa (Krishna Bose) represents shift, shown earning modest salary, also slated fat pay-hike, wants pursue modelling enrolled ballet classes. Siddhartha’s amazement gender shift - “Didi, you’ve changed lot” - well documented. Ray’s cinematic technique one highlights film. The influence French New Wave cinema evident thanks frequent jump-cuts, stylish visual metaphors impulsive dream sequences. All add chutzpah storytelling, also put together diverse assortment thoughts inside Siddhartha’s brain. I especially liked way mind transported certain Biology class, sees woman crossing street. The character Siddhartha essentially soul film insecurities viewers easily relate to. His predicament finding job shown rather painful process. The interview screening scenes tributes Ermanno Olmi’s gem The Job (1961), right nervous interviewee biting fingernails, lack seating arrangements, screenplay justice depict anxiety intellectual Bengali struggler 1970s. A highlight Siddhartha’s job interview scene - answers set tone follow course film. I loved way Ray used close-ups film. Siddhartha’s calm plea silence feels he’s lectured at, desire shoot enemy sight, transformation revolutionary second, scorn rich wealthy, disgust foreigners high dope, acute observations define nature. These little moments, add great value character development. Siddhartha’s search worthy job runs parallel search bird, childhood memories. The film well tie two searches together, till end. Although set Calcutta 1960s, Pratidwandi continues relevant considering city’s current state affairs. Employment still major issue. I tell personal experience, quiet composed Bengali ‘intellectual’ Siddhartha personifies film, still topic playful mockery often runs risk sounding frank candid loyalties preferences, appears job interviews. Pratidwandi certainly one Ray’s best works. I’m sure it’s DVD you’ll revisit again, unless academic purposes. Nevertheless, it’s fine story ideals compromised pressure reality. Watch Satyajit Ray, also get easy understanding mind struggler, stuck Leftist state opportunities few, embrace them, something give - soul, ideals temper.
