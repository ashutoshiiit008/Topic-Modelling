*I vacation. Pradeep kind enough review film wogma. So goes... ~ meetu* ---------------------------------------------- It election season, obviously Hindi cinema can't expected cash fervour. Bhoothnath, ghost failed miserably attempting scare bollocks little Banku back. This time, another kid company, time, he's taking establishment. Watching Amitabh Bachchan taking system historically always fun. This time though, he's little tongue-in-cheek, without landing fearsome kicks left many backside sore. Nitesh Tiwari, co-director Chillar Party, gives us film easily surpasses first one. Bhoothnath Returns heart right place. After escapades first film, Bhoothnath makes way sort ghost headquarters, known Bhoothworld, laughing stock ghost couldn't scare even little child. (Presumably every country Bhoothworld, land shown film, every ghost Indian.) Bhoothnath returns Earth make amends, gets sucked political battle crafty politician. The film quite funny spurts, really sweet, genuine way. The humour clean, times innocent can't help smile chuckle, even aren't actually tickled jokes. For example, keep look signboards Bhoothworld - remind time intent extra-smart cinema, wish make understated point. The real story film begins ghost decides wants stand elections. Now thing is, aren't able wrap head around unlikely premise, there's chance you'll even want see point film attempting make. There certain films one must suspend disbelief, film one those. Because really, film important message us - fact important active participant democratic process, important take onus selecting candidate, don't want candidate thrust throat. It's good see film takes general problems one would face corrupt politician power, rather equating real life elected villains. Amitabh Bachchan also shares warm camaraderie little boy goes unusual name 'Akhrot', means walnut. Played spunk child actor Parth, he's essentially soul film. In fact, despite terrific performances Mr. Bachchan Boman Irani politician Bhau, little Akhrot's character propels film directions chooses. After all, little children today future. They're ones who'll affected choices make today. The film also host good character actors smaller roles, appear one film. Brijendra Kala Sanjay Mishra - last seen Ankhon Dekhi - quite outstanding. Watch also couple superstar cameos, one scene involving well known Indian film director plays himself. The thing is, average Indian wasn't gullible apathetic, one could made serious film tackles message Bhoothnath Returns does. The film little preachy, little na√Øve times. Essentially film would work well educate children importance citizen democracy. Unfortunately, seems also way educate adults well. Another time, another place, one would say Bhoothnath Returns better predecessor, isn't particularly must-watch itself. This election season, however, one can't help wonder that, even though Bhoothnath Returns isn't nearly political film deserve, perhaps one need right now.
