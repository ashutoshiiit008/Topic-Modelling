Hollywood loved make alien invasion movies. 2009 different. From top hat I recall least bunch movies turned tables concept. There course Avatar, funny animated flick called Planet 51 there’s District 9. Interestingly three belong different genres seem targeted altogether different audiences. Planet 51 meant kids, instance. Yet three films common theme -- alien acceptable subjective alternative perspectives change one’s standpoints drastically. Avatar humans creating havoc alien landscape. Planet 51 astronaut landing unknown planet realising alien vice versa. District 9 however slightly different two. Here alien spaceship descends upon earth mysteriously malfunctions city Johannesburg. It continues stay without communications till humans break ship discover city malnutritioned alien beings. On humanitarian grounds, earthlings give refuge till realise might’ve made biggest mistake lives. Directed debutante Neill Blomkamp, District 9 adopts documentary style filmmaking first half. In second half however camera doesn’t move violently even action get pretty gruesome. The film owes roots Blomkamp’s sci-fi short film similar alien spaceship lands Johannesburg. Needless say film’s South African setting find lot references apartheid years. The theme forced eviction one instance. The name movie refers District 6 60,000 people evicted 60s. District 9 stark tale xenophobic nature human perspectives never-ending greed private corporations go extent make profits. The film also seems give message loud clear, message quite films last year seem giving -- humans mean always right. Wikus’ struggles heart-wrenching eye-openers. The tight screenplay path-breaking direction add pathos story. Of course, towards end District 9 resorts clichés. Either way makes great viewing must-have DVD.
