One would think enough films three philandering husbands cheating gullible wives. Anees Bazmee one. It's cheating bothers crassness way mind goes numb hours watching films. So, I actually looped joy line online ticket counter. And queue current tickets empty too! (I promise nothing ample parking space available.) An almost empty theater - die senseless films, die! And film started I said, "come Mr. Bazmee, make regret happiness." Nope time. It's weird concept it's leading gives sense anti-man pro-woman. But, could derogatory women main leads film one use fairer gender? Also, wasn't comforting man could bring solution women's problems. I'm feminist (at least popular sense term) don't mind seeing women are. But, woman either super-gullible piece pretty furniture, seriously? We don't really expect much terms acting Celina Jaitley actually isn't screen long enough prove either way. Donâ€™t look boys, forward complaints Azmee. Sonam Kapoor still comes across Bollywood's bachchi (kiddo), directors seem giving one emotion per film. In one she's made unsuccessful attempt sobbing try gain sympathy. We desensitized lot, Baby Kapoor, need try harder better quick, aren't patient either. And Rimi Sen can't blame herself. We seen awesome comic timing her. She tries fair bit too, doesn't work. Well, Irrfan Khan doesn't work, else can? It's almost director didn't want actors perform well. Suniel Shetty slapsticky bit (he made laugh couple times) Bobby Deol Bobby Deoly bit. Yes. That's it. That's I say. Yes. That's attempt refusing acknowledge "star" film continues assault intelligence gets support again. This sign 'non-support'.
