There ingredients thrillers pretty much indispensable. And "Speed" missing crucial elements. You need main hero oozes style. Sorry, two don't ooze style won't do. Same goes villain. Then need one-liners - might roll eyes said, agree thriller incomplete without them. And importantly - engaging plot! See, know itâ€™s average thriller, know earth won't shatter zillion pieces. But, least make teeny-weeny attempt engross us narrative. Again, out-of-this-world performances expected. Just enough move story along. And that, not-so-stellar cast accomplishes. We could done little less excited Zayed Khan, though. And earth Aftab Shivdasani sporting Mahendra Dhoni look? It amazing Aftab wear expression, matter made look like. I sure whether I completely blame actors lack style. The lamest dialogues ever fit two hours. How stylistically deliver lousy lines all? The plot tries strike balance two main threads, least two mini-threads, 4 actors, ladies. That's whole lot, thus loss focus mismanagement pace really surprise. I really didn't like way motivation villains unfolds us. Too little, late. What I like though, action sequences saved Zayed Khan. They very-well choreographed executed. The songs dull - lyrics, music, picturization, choreography, etc. Particularly bad one supposedly love scene. People, decide - either bold enough show couple actually making love, skip it! You fooling one using silly editing techniques imply twosome actually anything. Another director going bad worse. Another movie actors continuing every movie. Another story needed least another year's worth work. Another songs cine-goer could survived without. Another wannabe entertainer released Friday.
