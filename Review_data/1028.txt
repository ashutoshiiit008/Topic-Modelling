I couldn't stop laughing minute credits started rolling. And smile face next minutes. Nope! Even easily amused can't term one comedy. I kicked audience taken ride. It's super-fun ride means great cinematic experience entertainer. It's smart concept didn't manage keep hooked. In interest sounding little less abstract yet truthful theme blog, I'm going use analogy. Say, teacher who's going introduce new topic class today. To make lesson interesting choose play game. Now idea playing game really neat, but, BUT choose boring game, lost class. Your creativity admirable, class engaged. So, idea playing game broad concept Via Darjeeling I'm going call choice game, basic story. The conversation bunch people discussing event interesting event. As character points out, discussion could classic study human nature. But it's not, basic premise lame. The story somewhat saved ever-reliable Kay Kay Menon. The subtle changes character moves one part movie next, absolutely attributable performance. You actually see Parvin Dabas' act too. Sonali Kulkarni's hammed performance also passed guise character's eccentricity ambiguity. But, entire set-up friends talking, fun, quibbling other, came extremely superficial. If one relationship oozed extreme familiarity one point, next, characters would saying things made seem like strangers. There's fleeting interplay amongst characters. So, individual characters detailed, relationships broadly sketched. And talking likes Vinay Pathak, Rajat Kapoor, Sandhya Mridul, Prroshant Narayanan here. I liked work one movie other, willing blame completely lack proverbial chemistry. Compound overall drawling tone movie can't blamed getting wee bit fidgety. And wasn't enough, songs absolutely misplaced, don't go ambiance created movie. Yet, director cannot written off, tried. Tried something ventured easily Hindi cinema - story without closure. There's conflict needs resolution. And trying gets brownie points around here. Along way, also commented basic nature humans indulge something doesn't concern whatsoever. And though doesn't hook audience, surely teases right end.
