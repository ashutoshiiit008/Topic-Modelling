Premasathi Coming Suun children’s film (not inappropriate them). But everything comedy film childish even kids would laugh it. It’s sheer waste money producers, also viewers. The film uninspiring rom-com young man, gets married gorgeous woman chosen grandmother. This bride, however, hidden agenda. As groom’s family discovers secret subsequently, it’s ridicule moment anyone. Nobody really cares film inspired (or copied) films long moves brings smiles face. Unfortunately; immaturely-written, predictable film kills excitement every point. The prevalent issue Premasathi Coming Suun lacks sincerity. Director Ankur Kakatkar seems concerned stunning leading lady Neha Pendse looks. Unfortunately, leads lacklustre display every front. Pathetic story, incongruous sequences, lame direction, futile production - name film it. Regrettably, film doesn’t single scene make sympathise protagonists’ emotional state hook you. Premasathi Coming Suun another fine example mundane films remind over-exaggerated acts like theater. In fact, film occasionally appears one play projected celluloid. None actors show true grit least help tolerate bizarre narrative. The lack prudent writing certainly fault crippled performances. The buck stops Kakatkar. The makers’ heavy reliance tedious one-liners punch lines falls flat faces. It high time filmmakers realised seriousness comedy. A closer look Marathi comedies released recent past reveals look prosaic; thanks worn-out, rhymed lines. I dialogue, overuse issue. A fresh approach front must. If torture wasn’t enough, place songs make matter worse you. Move Sheila Munni, Gulabo come grab attention. This particular song could easily edited out. Give film miss unless want pull hair out.
