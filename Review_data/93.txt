Most popular cinema takes given audience thinking population comes sit back talk cell phone eat popcorn, coffee etc. They often insult viewers mind stick theatrical performances Shahrukh Khans. This film however, transcended problem. The director shown maturity full understanding viewers. At point film tend go ridiculous overacting. In fact, given storyline lines, Irfan Shobhana done wonderful job. Good direction right choice actors made film perfect. The script story married fine points taken care of. However struck due course film inability director break stereotypical image woman mother wife. New age cinema India attempt break stereotypes; otherwise would circulate subconscious minds viewers.
