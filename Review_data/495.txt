The saying film written twice – writing table editing table – used abused often completely healthy. Yet, experience watching Mani Ratnam’s Kadal fraught moments reminded uncompromising theorem repeatedly. Enough, least, make ardent Mani Ratnam zealots like wonder great man’s heart really film first place. Set primarily Christian fishing village, Kadal tale love, faith, revenge loss. An incident seminary two men leads enmity lasts lifetime. Years later, caught middle saga young orphan Thomas, essentially wanderer – boy whose choices, hence destiny, hinge beliefs two men standing opposite ends spectrum faith. The film, armed interesting premise, legendary director slew experienced accomplished technicians, best patchy effort – let mostly screenplay (co-written Mani Ratnam himself) editing, long-term collaborator, A. Sreekar Prasad. Be narration story emotions scenes situations intend convey, graph film highly uneven. Strange, Ratnam Prasad masters designing narrative; weaving situations together without dumbing things down, forcing viewers make generous leaps faith either. A number previous collaborations like Kannathil Muthamittal, Alaipayuthey Aaytha Ezhuthu come mind. Making matters worse runtime film, whopping two three-quarters hour. Also, film named Kadal (which means ‘sea’), striking void I felt I walked away film even continuous presence sea film didn’t affect emotionally even visually. Intended perhaps allegory God – sea, all, all-consuming unrelenting sinners yet all-embracing omnipotent seeking redemption, faith – fails create connect viewers desperately need involving story universal values highly local flavour. A. R. Rahman’s refreshingly haunting soundtrack film helps extent; stays long film. However, manner songs filmed left disappointed well – 'Adiye' 'Nenjukulle' particular. Again, extremely strange, considering Mani Ratnam’s particular expertise picturizing songs. Rajiv Menon’s cinematography, slightly uneven, largely asset enchanting frames. Undoubtedly tough film shoot, manages retain gritty, rustic feel village without ever compromising contemporary look style film. Kadal marks return Arvind Swamy long hiatus decade, man hasn’t forgotten act. His calming, serene presence adds unquantifiable undeniable measure stability film, anchoring throughout. The return veteran complemented debuts two star offspring. Gautham Karthik’s unconventional, scruffy look suits character Thomas, still distance cover emoting dialogue delivery departments. Even so, Kadal good debut youngster. His love interest Beatrice played Thulasi Nair, looks pretty, also still quite raw actress. The nearly three hours I spent theatre almost frozen start end. As ardent film buff student cinema, I left alternately awe director I look Indian filmmakers, time, disappointed perhaps first time ever, emotional cinematic connect Mani Ratnam film sporadic best. The mastery still there, doubt, I couldn’t help feeling Mani Ratnam’s heart wasn’t time round.
