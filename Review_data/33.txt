The opening 20 minutes Ghajini-director A. R. Murugadoss’s latest offering, Surya-starrer 7 aum Arivu, made smile like films recent past have. Set centuries Christ ancient India China, film opens almost like documentary origins Shaolin clan. Ravi K. Chandran’s cinematography portions described stunning. Every grain surface film stock used seemed milked whatever worth, produce exquisite shots, used primarily montage. How much actually post-production would make interesting topic debate though. With arresting visuals, impressive production VFX, unique concept roots history, opening reels film laid promising foundation smart, action-packed sci-fi thriller. Thereafter, however, film nosedives mediocrity like Ra.One’s second week box-office collections. Still, I couldn’t shake first twenty minutes film head even hours screening. That Tamil film industry technically par organizationally miles ahead Hindi counterpart secret. But I couldn’t stop wondering diminutive, almost inconsequential looking Murugadoss could vision execute I saw initial reels 7 Aum Arivu, stops Hindi film industry same? Once film shifts present, begins meander around pointless songs, embarrasses scientific community hare-brained theories genetic engineering descends near-right wing Tamil pride preachiness. Along way, also finds time Chinese people speak English accent would make people believe ‘Britishers’ Sanjay Khan’s Tipu Sultan actually Britain. If anything marginally redeems film entirety, Surya. He exudes charm genuineness many Indian viewers used seeing. Add fact dances like dream supremely confident kind action. Surya is, quite simply, star. Surprisingly, even Shruti Haasan revelation film. She looks ethereal Indian clothes, extremely camera friendly, seems absolutely problem dubbing Tamil. 7 Aum Arivu go long way erasing memories disaster named Luck. The man playing Dong Lee, Chinese villain, also bit. He expectedly good action looks menacing enough. Which brings us back basic problem plaguing this, indeed films today – writing. Mediocre best downright shoddy worst, dialogues cringe-worthy. I fail understand week week, audiences get witness films could been, not. While Murugadoss needs lauded selecting new subject film, treatment needs serious criticism. Understandably, make film palatable primarily Tamil audience. How one wishes though, commercial pressures would figure highly list priorities Indian filmmakers. All said done, I walked away cinema hall feeling tad bit impressed. While don’t venture deep cinematic waters, Tamil filmmakers like Murugadoss Shankar (Endhiran, Sivaji – The Boss) show hints vision Hindi cinema seems sorely lack. 7 Aum Arivu, though overall letdown, complete waste time primarily vision.
