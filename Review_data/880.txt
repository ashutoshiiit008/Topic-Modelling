All glitters gold. It also silver bronze. And metals charm. So Ta Ra Rum Pum glitters extravagant locales extra bright reds blues, don't necessarily add value art form cinema is. But, manage tell regular story style warms heart. Thinking movie two hours left theater, first thing comes mind car races. They timed well executed even better. However, I would liked aerial shots fewer close-ups. Who wants see sweaty Saif Ali Khan? Only face shows helmet, gals! The races broad story-line remind lot Naya Daur (1957), Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander (1992), Cars (2006). The next thing comes mind two cutely picturised songs. "Ab forever" didn't necessarily complicated dance moves, structured choreography interspersed normal dancing made delight watch. "tara ra rum pum, ta ra rum pum" far best picturised kids' song "akdam bakdam" Hanuman (2005). The lyrics general, specifically "Saiyaan", restore faith Jaaved saahab Namastey London (2007) debacle. Which leaves us two romantic tracks. Those reminiscent songs late 80s-early 90s thus didn't quite fit rest movie. Were songs required, ask? Have seen promos, dear? No? The newspaper ads producer's name it? Okay-you least know title movie, right? Then, kind question that!? I seriously think movie named came kids' song first. They even bother use perfectly valid excuse - Rani Mukherjee plays singer. We seen Rani Mukherjee marital tiffs Vivek Oberoi (Saathiya (2002)), Shah Rukh Khan (Chalte Chalte (2003)), Abhishek Bachchan (Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006)). Now Saif Ali Khan's turn. It's pretty much Rani here. The Rani makes shut ears shrieks playing 20 year old warms heart plays age. Again, Saif Ali Khan nothing path-breaking. But sticks genre doesn't go overboard. The children give endearing performance. At times though, Angelina Idnani (Princess) given dialogues mature her. The voiceover especially certainly overkill. Their characters situation looked like heavily drawn Itni Si Baat (1981), Life Is Beatiful (1997). Someone I would loved see of, would Jaaved Jaaferi. Why wasn't allowed shake leg two? At least gave best lines delivered "Videocon Flashback" style. Everything average, acting, direction, screenplay, story, editing (it could well cut short good 15-20 minutes). But, I scoffed every time I asked suspend disbeliefs, scene accompanied shade creativity kept entertained. And gradually, without realizing it, I rooting R V (Saif) didn't care many cinematic liberties director would take make end happily ever after. So, somewhere along line characters plot touched soft spot I didn't want bad things happen them. Whether indeed feel good movie check yourself. I would wait video I didn't review one. But mood well-shot car races sweetly picturised songs, don't miss theaters, take kids along. Correction: Earlier I mentioned "Shakalaka Boom Boom" instead "Namastey London" third paragraph. Indeed, lyrics Shakalaka Boom Boom written Sameer. Thanks, Charles Foster Kane aka Antonio Ricci, pointing out. Apologies readers!
