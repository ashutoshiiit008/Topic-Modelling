Many time, storywriters use stories put across ideologies audience. Now, writing style might great, least likable. But, reader/viewer doesn't subscribe ideology, writer lost one member audience. And Bhoothnath, I member. I captive audience till started beating well-trodden path stereotypes meddling religious issues. What I call religious issues actually borderlines faith. Especially, specific Hindu rite mentioned symbolic idea parents need gesture acceptance, love. While, might far-fetched, I doubt many viewers take away. The point instead imposing religious traditions using particular practice example, larger, global sub-plot chosen, point might gotten better. A lot blame could also go absolutely unforeseeable slack pace change execution style. From creative cute use otherwise-oft-seen special effects, sent second half magical treats vanishing act. From fun, adorable chain events, suddenly thrown rather gloomy outlook society. From first half two fairly well developed characters, abruptly introduced new characters half-baked relationships post-interval. Fortunately though, performances suffer inconsistency. Amitabh Bachchan plays grandfatherly ghost, Bhoothnath, won't let anyone stay house even though spirit inhabit it. His comic timing impeccable ever. Not worry, Amitabh fans - funny faces, angst person worried someone close, grief-stricken eyes memory painful event - much there, debacle called RGV ki Aag hasn't taken away him. The area came across superficial angry ol' man required angry. Sad true. Anyway, looks like little Aman, plays naughty Banku, taken leaf veteran's book. Every time Aman Siddiqui came screen, I couldn't take eyes eyes - innocence, twinkle, sadness - story demanded. Same goes Juhi Chawla plays cheerful self, time mother unbelievable sense humor. But come scenes require anxious glycerinated eyes make work seem effortless. I usually refrain commenting special appearances, Shah Rukh Khan's presence little special appearance. It wouldn't unfair say screen presence side characters. Shah Rukh Khan plays Shah Rukh Khan Banku's father. The significance attached character's deeds seem like parts forcibly blown-up fit stature star. Now, whether succeeds performing role first-weekend promotional material, box office tell couple days. Anyhow, long, long time Satish Shah Rajpal Yadav actually made laugh. But disappear latter half movie. And start complaints. Keep mind I let go usual issue related non-defined super-powers. As in, Bhoothnath show himself, doesn't want seen? So, every time, I saw cool usage graphics, I hoped won't overdo it, didnâ€™t. I happy. Every time, looked like story going go predictable zone, unexpected line brought loud laughter. I happy. I thoroughly enjoyed comment TV soap operas. Things going really well till questions started getting answered. Then, I asked, "Where's conflict?" There came, good, bad...a little longer would become serious match tone movie far. "Where's Bhoothnath's backstory? What's problem?" And I asked much. The movie blindly nosedived new characters 45 minutes go. One Bhoothnath's son, introduced late, full character arc, rapid transition et al, albeit under-developed. I found little speeches little boring stereotype Indian emigrants bit harsh. Ultimately, resolution story whole biggest let-down all. All said done, Bhoothnath surely deserves credit taking younger target audience granted. Well executed "tributes" animation used Harry Potter series, ensures kids get quality product. If only, maintained end, only...
