There something fascinating short film. Within minutes, usually one-fourth length feature film, made create world, develop characters, present resolve conflict see beginning, middle end. Each five films makes Shorts, unique way goes business. However, things might understand make feel needed time film. There times abstract treatment could get annoying. In either case, still effort definitely needs encouragement. There things absolutely great across board. Performances outstanding films. Even tempting name known faces, It would unfair point great acts. They rooted set real life, except maybe second film, The Epilogue needs histrionics abstract treatment carries. Similarly films also creates universe best fitted concept/theme. The ambiance pitch perfect interestingly, even though one different other, easy enough move one without feeling uprooted previous one. Dialogue is, general, sparse, except Audacity needs chaos generates. I think beauty dialogue writing, need know characters speak. It gives much room rest crew director actors camera music departments. Most enticing concepts picked writer/director combination makes feature length film. Let's take brief look one. For detailed look, watch film, course. Sujata Shlok Sharma A girl abused cousin childhood till present time she's grown woman. Sujata get rooting protagonist even though barely know her. Unfortunately, also becomes handicap. To continue feeling angst struggle, offered much backstory. How justified anger towards cousin? Do endorse actions? While I unanswered questions films, one made uncomfortable. The Epilogue Siddharth Gupt Fear. How deal it? Maybe, way face fear, ignore it. After all, like beautiful woman throws tantrum get attention. And maybe one way deal her. Or maybe claustrophobic relationship story needs get closure. That beauty The Epilogue, open interpretation. Audacity Anirban Roy The mind teenager. An already confused one. And face perplexing thus, frustrating double standards parents. These standards lack thereof allow adults take responsibility contribution child's misbehaviour. This child decides teach lesson. Is child right behaving so? Are parents right thing? This Bengali (with English subtitles) short, Audacity doesn't take sides tells us maybe everyone responsible said situation would go around circles played blame game. Mehfuz Rohit Pandey Mehfuz mood creates camera work sound design trying say. With films, go looking meaning deeper meaning. Its morbid looks morbidity eye. It goes confirm, even cold graveyard worker cannot really get used death. Shor Neeraj Ghaywan Nothing like sounds Mumbai make movie called Shor. That also points internal chaos one us faces, course, larger significance. Most struggle lot one major relationship life dissatisfactory is. It never stopped amazing that, important relationship life one mistreat most. And yet, life offers us chance set things right. Shor creates right tone say. ~ ~ ~ Each films something going takes serious look one aspect life other. Which brings one question I've short films general. Why serious? Does comedy need bigger canvas? Even so, cannot deny "different" experience welcome change. In last 5-7 years, every second third year, one feature length film collection short films. It really heartening see two films year. I imagine time, hopefully far away, films norm, also feature film preceded followed short film worth coming early waiting for. More power brave souls taken first step towards making happen.
