One filmmaker realizes difference paper celluloid. Pravin Raja Karale, director Bokad, must felt script hand something drove make film. In fact, I refuse believe filmmaker anywhere world sets make film material knows absolute, universal trash. (Yes, even Sajid Khan.) It Tolkien-esque journey paper film makes cinema driving force behind existence us. Bokad premise could easily sounded convincing paper. A group college kids Mumbai go field trip village, embroiled whims rural life political games played grassroots gigantic pseudo-democratic edifice controls existence. And village sarpanch's goat centre all, like mute, near-inconsequential metaphor honour, pride respect. Ignoring distinct possibility none I wrote crossed filmmakers’ minds, viewers end mess film, put together ability required set toddler’s game ‘house-house’. To make matters worse, makers decided go 20 songs film, I’m even exaggerating. So one miserably choreographed song left feet Western hemisphere pops every five minutes, supposedly ‘unfold mystery behind story’ [sic]. The perplexing aspect film undoubtedly casting. The unfortunate young men women playing collegians also turn villagers, reporters even background extras various points film. I spent much first half believing kind inspired cinematic decision, giving makers credit something blatantly avant-garde, showing finger purists saving money time. Eventually however, I came conclusion saving money, cinematic expression damned. In fact, various times I felt Bokad truly lost opportunity. There much could done juxtaposing beliefs behaviour Mumbai-based youth rural setting. Even something simple yearning non-vegetarian food brought smartly squandered away. Village level politics also touched upon, relegated sidelines focus shifts tomfoolery half-baked love story. Sayaji Shinde Kishore Kadam, spotted earlier Ram Gopal Varma’s films, picks cast. Devious theatrics seem come naturally performers, ability hold attention flirt dangerously boundaries acting over-acting. The rest walk frames there, like folded paper one would stuff rickety table's leg temporarily stabilize it. Poor writing mediocre cast look even worse combined dated feel film. In this, goat title film gets raw deal. Talked throughout, poor fellow gets barely screen time all. Perhaps used metaphor film itself. Bokad one films come go without much whimper.
