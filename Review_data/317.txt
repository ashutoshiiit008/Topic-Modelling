This summer block buster; one many Hollywood keeps dishing fond hope least one would set cash registers ringing loudly. Having never seen earlier films series, I looked forward hot road action fisticuffs, tremendously disappointed. This film downright lame; summer action block buster required hot gals, automotive action, studly heroes, combines limp fashion, becomes drag. Of course, set piece action sequences; one cars moving hyper kinetic speeds. The film opens one set piece, introduces “cool” characters story. This sequence predictable obvious outcome, CGI effects add nothing it. When film cuts CGI frame “real” one, perspective changes obvious manner, viewer immediately sees “real” much slow. This kills whatever impact sequence might had. Action sequences hard visualize stage; created manner look good screen really counts. This director badly needs lessons, possibly take tip two John Frankenheimer; take look superbly executed car chase narrow roads Frankenheimer gave us Ronin. The car chase sequences set tunnels one city roads too. The tunnel sequences also suffer CGI syndrome. Yes, lot fast editing, rapid cuts revving speedometers, loud sounds, gives big, bad, headache. The best sequence lot illegal race held city streets, simply CGI seems kept minimum, one gets feel speed last minute near misses. There wonder wonders, chase foot too, done half hearted manner. The director probably believed needed keep things moving engage audience let worry plot; keeps story moving, keeps camera moving, keeps cars moving too. This formula work comes “emotional / bonding” scenes characters. These scenes become ponderous; thanks clichéd dialogue wooden acting, sink like lead weights. Vin Diesel much acting ability pectorals, fact seem speak time. The rest cast motley mish mash toned bodies wearing snazzy clothes, nothing much do, really matter. The villain piece looks like one stereotypical drug dealers infest streets Los Angeles ( least Hollywood movies), chains, rings, flash. The bad boys really try hard look bad, buffed bodies, tattoos, obligatory snarls. The eye candy stay around long one really good lecherous look. The whole movie looks feels like recycled shows TV; MTV Grind police serials immediately come mind. The FBI Agents, villains, heroes, obviously copies copies, one experiences sensation equivalent eating pureed cardboard, watching film. Watch film feel like pubescent lad one, rest need find better things hot summer day.
