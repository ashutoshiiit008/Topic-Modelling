With enviable filmography underlines terrific versatility, Ang Lee's cinematic adaptation Yann Martel's Man Booker-winning novel Life Pi, easily one marquee films year, especially trailers film unveiled. A gorgeous, visually stunning film tries hard retain essence Martel's novel, film succeed count, measure. Pi Patel, seems enchanting story behind every facet life, starting one behind name, spends formative years life growing idyllic Pondicherry. A fascinating boyhood, includes devouring works Camus & Dostoyevsky unique tryst religion amongst things, uprooted family decides set sail Canada, good. Disaster strikes voyage, however, Pi stranded lifeboat, mid-ocean, rather large, carnivorous feline spirituality company. Make mistake - best use 3D since Hugo truly exceptional CGI, Life Pi sumptuous visual treat. Jaw-droppingly beautiful frames abound film, enhanced subtle, melodious haunting background score. Life Pi complete victory vision well execution, far recreating world Martel's book concerned. The alternating rage calm sapphire-blue ocean, hypnotic sunsets, nocturnal marine bioluminescence, everything visual film work art. The peak tiger, takes CG cinema astonishing new level. Fur historically toughest detail animators crack. Here, fur embellishes beautiful, strong sinews perfect. So realistic tiger film that, apart chinks vis-Ã -vis scale perspective, nearly impossible tell isn't real. That said, Life Pi means perfect film. It takes get used Irrfan (adult Pi) Adil Hussain's (young Pi's father) horrendously awkward, fake Indian accents. It dampens otherwise excellent performances two. Also, Ang Lee seems pushed corner attempting direct many actors varied nationalities film - side characters, particular, extremely wooden unconvincing. Tabu, brief role young Pi's mother, calming presence. Suraj Sharma plays shipwrecked Pi, good job it. But non-CG cast doesn't hold candle tiger charming human name - discover haven't read book - steals show. But really, reasons film didn't meet expectations different plane altogether. Apart hype film generated world over, one reasons I really looking forward film topical relevant right now, particularly us Indians. With two high profile deaths recent past, opinions medium voice spoke loud, invariably extreme views each, particularly respect religion. But opinions heard were, end day, minority opinions. The truth majority us still grappling make God religion. Life Pi, book, power least give views religion food thought, set ball rolling least consider discovering essentially human construct power sway minds way does. I went expecting Ang Lee achieve effect via cinema, I walked away tad disappointed. The task daunting, doubt, seems like Lee screenwriter David Magee played safe issues chose concentrate ones chose skirt. There much like Life Pi, film, I would recommend anyone loves cinema. But film manages evoke curiosity book inspires least handful people actually read book, delve deeper philosophy behind question really know feel God religion, would real victory Ang Lee would achieved could magnum opus.
