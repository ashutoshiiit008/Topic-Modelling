Maharathi serves slap face people use Paresh Rawal, Boman Irani even Om Puri mindless slapstick. And rightly so. These men capable much average script take up. Alas, thriller doesn’t chill spine. The anxiety doesn’t build-up frame given little extra time linger, character extra moment make roots minds, actor extra moment shine. Except one-off case, senses stimulated given breather kills suspense. Also, I find thrillers go back-and-forth-and-back-again tiring. Not I keep track turn re-turn events, gives feeling ‘we trying hard thrill you, better sit edge now.’ To add this, one aspect character exposed screen. The others either blind left half-baked. So don’t know scheming mind wants loot not, wouldn’t know root for. Sure, don’t always need someone cheer, ok, give someone get frustrated with, angry at. Yet, see Naseerudin Shah, Paresh Rawal, Boman Irani fill screen tight close-ups taking one chance show mettle want forgive everything. It’s much credit Neha Dhupia stand tall treat characters trash (the way intended to). And yet, movie talent (even keep Neha Dhupia equation) disposal living too, cannot evoke kind emotion, rather disheartening. Moreover, heart, premise arouses good deal curiosity. So, maybe, extra something went a-moment-longer-than necessary pauses, caused damage.
