All us read book, I loved it. That led lot detailed voyages outings one Gulliver, trip changed total adventure. This movie modern take lines, it's silly boring. A common mail room man goes Bermuda assignment looses way. He guy need ego boost, ends tallest man strange land Lilliput. Oh loves it, something goes wrong. Add little spice, guy simple jack good heart wants help everyone. This movie obviously “Every dog day” make day confident. The story focuses mainly Gulliver’s adventure Lilliput people one-twelfth size. Then cameo Brobdingnag, people twelve times size humans, Gulliver live doll. Lack right pace story puts movie “far expectations” list I have. They rush build up, prolong twilight talks – I don’t categorize adventurism. Jack Black okay role, definitely original School Rock. Speaking original, I think everything everyone film imitation. Even Emily Blunt, cast Princess Mary, seemed fake – even blonde! But top direction, really unintelligent imitation great story. It felt miserable see one favorite books turn bits pieces non-performance. Back acting, Lilliputian Gulliver befriends initial days prisoner, Horatio – done right Jason Segal, still refrains playing honest convincing role. Sure induced good stuff, like references Titanic Gavatar. But film fails comedy, even children’s adventure. It shot unrealistically. I mean, Jajantaram-Mamantaram better! The 3D feels like desperate attempt attract audiences. Most obviously shot green screens.. And oh, could I forget mention feeble attempt humor… serious put off! I almost went sleep movie. Children might see want, would better not.
