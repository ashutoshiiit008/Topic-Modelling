Forgive I’ve avid reader Marvel comics, review might one film. That said, I found hooting, cheering, laughing loud enjoying every minute The Avengers, without comic-book fan. I did, however, read length character graph film, even without background study, The Avengers must-watch: sheer indulgence world action-packed, entertaining thrilling once. The Avengers intertwine lives previous superheroes (with movies): Captain America, Thor, Iron Man Hulk. With Black Widow (Scarlett Johanssen) Hawk-Eye (Jeremy Renner), brought together prevent event global danger. Our heroes (and heroine) tracking Tesseract, cube cosmic super-power, also present movies Iron Man 2, Captain America: The First Avenger Thor. The Tesseract landed wrong hands Loki (Tom Hiddleson), film’s wily villain also Thor’s step-brother. Loki’s intentions clear - rule world subjugate King. Director secret international peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) worried desperate. He rounds super-heroes save world feudal monster – it’s cliché works superbly. It holds you, makes sit tiny, uncomfortable edge seat rejoice/scream/cheer. The film takes time establish super-hero, film makes sure every characteristic heroes brought in. Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man sassy suave ever, Chris Evans Captain America brave confused defiant World War II veteran. The new entrants charming: Mark Ruffalo Hulk fits part T, Scarlett Johansson plays sly Russian Spy Black Widow incorporating personal flair character. Oh, spend roughly 10 mins film analyzing characters. Before know it, picked seat taken epic adventure Avengers take. Director Joss Whedon maintains engaging pace, film shifts blasting action sequences witty repartee characters. Ofcourse Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man fore-front humor, surprisingly every character follows through. You given enough moments film laugh loud generally, good time. It’s balance struck perfection. Although plot-line formulaic tad bit predictable, film leave spontaneously wide-eyed compelling chemistry character witty-dialogue/grand-action routine. The Avengers mammoth spectacle. And yet, retrospect don’t feel deceived overdose mindless action. Each character holds film, therefore treat prefer one particular character another (Iron Man!). The 3D version adds grandeur film, fluid camera work, feel like part adrenaline-pumped videogame. At 146 mins, The Avengers worth every minute time.
