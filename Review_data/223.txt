I'm always looking forward stories told new writer/directors especially almost whole team fresh. The known faces DAM 999 Ashish Vidyarthi, Rajit Kapoor Linda Arsenio Kabul Express. But DAM 999 choppy style narration thrill you. That besides, everything else takes away sort-of, kind-of novel plot point. I saw English version, accents Indian actors seemed affected - Just like Hindi non-Indian sounds Hindi film. I know itâ€™s difficult call, watching Megha Burman exaggerate Ts Cs character bred Kerala(?) raised south Indian played Rajit Kapoor goes great extent bring South Indian language. I'm discussing accents detail act major distractions don't allow characters, might well written, grow you. Also, take away performances. Even I let go, another major nuisance glaring you. 3D. Why? Not one scene, single one required technology. DAM 999 unnecessarily ended two shades darker made spend extra Rs.30 deposit glasses. Every I took glasses picture crystal clear - means actually 2D play. What scam, I tell you! And certainly put-off. The commentary beginning film alludes fact story going use 'navarasa' express various characters. Also, mumbo-jumbo nine planets forces behind life. And forced use number nine justify 999 title. The story nothing politician controlling everything around achieve political aspirations. The rest, including entire set-up ship, side-stories aimed covering 999 mentioned above. DAM 999 certainly took plate lot could chew. 3D, navarasa, 9 planets, 4 languages, politics, social impact dams, name few. The result combination bland actors trying hard play plot place.
