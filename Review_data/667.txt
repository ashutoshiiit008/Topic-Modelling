Time strange, way. It waits one, also always catches you. When does, you're usually left rueing past dreading future. In Alexander Payne's unhurried, warm Nebraska, old man shaky past, bleak future questionable mental abilities heart set wild goose chase - supposed windfall he's sure - take Montana Nebraska. Stubborn unrelenting is, one two sons decides humour take along, doesn't know long father live anyway. There joy seeing filmmaker knows characters stories well, sees need push things make happen. Nebraska funny, slow, gentle moving. It explores many different kinds relationships family, well extended family. The endearing among father son. David, son, personal problems well, puts side concentrate father. The father, brash, near-senile old fellow drinking problem, doesn't give much make like him. Yet, sight son much father never strikes false note; see level he's terrified thought old age, sets upon him. Also, since film largely set small town called Hawthorne Nebraska, also genuinely insightful moments show sleepy, close-knit town almost like one gigantic joint family, unlike large cities you're alone even you're crowd. Shot gorgeous black-and-white folksy soundtrack company, film exudes charm harks back days old. Like previous film The Descendants, Alexander Payne seems wonderful quality creating memorable scenes unlikeliest settings. In Nebraska, watch set places you'd least expect - cemetary, example. Veteran actor Bruce Dern, Oscar-nominated turn father Woody Nebraska, quite terrific. He alternately display spurts comprehension stretches lost, convincingly. He also almost always interested reason wants visit Nebraska first place, despite everyone close telling he's rocker. However, despite Bruce Dern walking away nominations accolades one, film actually shouldered almost entirely Will Forte, plays David. The film essentially David's story; graph, growth, resolution, they're his. Reminiscent, strangely, young Quentin Tarantino, Forte's straight face tackles complex scenes may reason may appear hasn't put much Dern, fact Forte holds film together. His severely underrated performance. As journey film unspools gently, find knowing whether smile feel sorry Woody David. Eventually, though, despite note film ends sticking wee bit rest film, unsaid feelings love respect hit home. You're left feeling that, us, still hope.
