Mountain climber Aron Ralston gets pinned rock wall canyon Utah 127 hours, famous feat survival captured film. The story practically unbelievable hear real, book “Between Rock Hard Place” Aron Ralston himself. It life-or-death experience one man goes through, courage determination shows keep sane it. This man believes life, knows body anything survive. It natural high expectations Danny Boyle Oscar Slumdog Millionaire. And true commitment hard work, gives us film leaves us thinking. It story hero, survivor. Screenplay wee bit stretched, really build tension. Music good, certainly heard better Rahman. The absolutely brilliant cinematography Enrique Chediak Anthony Dod Mantle might well get Oscar. It best part movie, apart captivating reality story, course. The direction photography used exciting effect, even confined tiny place literally unmovable man. Smart editing use split-screen present adrenaline really worked. And top views canyon show scale operation simply stupendous. James Franco excellent job hiker loves canyon desert. He came complete surprise me, I thought Green Goblin’s cute son Spiderman series. Here, thrill seeker gets stuck bad position one get into, time introspect come side - changed man. It outstanding Franco makes feel pain, frustration, hope, disappointment. Every line face tells story immerses role. Better still fact film almost entirely casts him, yet manages bore audience. In fact, scenes bring goose bumps. Obviously, film overwhelming. I couldn’t sit one go - take break come back. It could I couldn’t bear look helpless situation, could movie captivating enough. The gore – yes big share (nothing outrageous though) – still tolerable. What constant reminders loneliness hallucinations shown. I doubt circumstances could effect me, still pleasant watch. The flashbacks poke you, makes believe film scene. Though lull flashbacks Ralston takes through, still makes good build film says end. It man’s invincible live unthinkable act survival. I loved way Boyle made film emotionally inspirational values life making look like Saw. If can’t take little gore can't watch continuous mental pain another person going through, you’d rather watch it. Else must watch, big screen better impact.
