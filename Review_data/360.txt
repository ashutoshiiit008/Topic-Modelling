One (wo)man make difference. And happens man love willing give all, nothing like it. That's how, dear friend, come upon romantic comedy takes social causes. Putting way, might little unfair, belittling larger purpose film too. But dry functional manner events take place get involved all. Starting basics, romantic film able convey couple love other. Just pointing age difference, matter isn't taken care of, it? Doesn't audience need convinced love other? Some chemistry superficial "good deed"? Superficial - word comes mind film - romance, comedy social causes lady, Dia (Kareena Kapoor) takes up. By end, almost every thing happens earlier comes across set-up. Any joke made, anything negative positive said ties neatly end either related back reversed contrived fashion. Given dialogue comic lines work briefly seen trailer, left actual cause taken Dia. That situation handled could engaging affair. But well, gets repetitive anyway predictable word go. With way many songs beginning avoidable narrative thread film, Gori Tere Pyaar Mein also long. Sure, narrator also used alter ego, makes transition, well, superficial. :) It doesn't help Kareena Kapoor wears designer outfits even she's staying remote village Gujrat. I guess thankful repeats outfits. The silver lining, however, Kareena Kapoor gives decent performance. Imran Khan usual self - doesn't impress doesn't annoy either. The cast Gujrat village though refreshingly home. From little boy village head, added ambiance village. Yet again, romantic comedy underwhelming. At least, case didn't expect different.
