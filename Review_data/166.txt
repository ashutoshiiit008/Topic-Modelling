...actually is. It attempts comedy succeeds making laugh even once. It same-same romantic story different doesn't make go "aaaaawww" once. It also different Nagesh Kukunoor products. While Hyderabad Blues average Iqbal regular story presented well. Teen Deewarein Dor(though copies) certainly worth writing home about. Bombay Bangkok however one feel ashamed about...let alone made it, wouldn't want people know watched it. How amateurish 25-30 year old song play every time certain character comes screen!? So funny, sad way romanticize anything. To add mayhem, voiceovers used avoid actual narration shabby dream sequences appear annoy. Making brainless flick art. An art easy master. Even accept sexual references, toilet jokes, stereotyping, etc. indispensable part slapstick, need something extra keep together. The movie driving force. Watching Bombay Bangkok made feel everyone going motions, one really interested. The cameraman seemed pick angles director played "eeny-meeny-miney-moe" decide final shot. The editor seems chopping stuff sleep. Only explain shots never seem end others way abrupt. The background music pretty random too. Waltz replaced jingle-like tune rhyme reason. Like everything else script completely thought either. After east meets far-east basic concept, rest seems written sporadically - thinking thousand things. The screenplay like character running one situation another without connection between. An aimless, listless approach. Having said that, cast rise flaws whatever best can, given constraints mediocre team. What bothers Nagesh Kukunoor, arguably one better film-makers industry, shown thoughtless attitude film-making. It truly disheartening see struggle fail miserably trying fit mainstream.
