Disclaimer time. Park Chan-wook's Oldboy ranks amongst favourite films time, deals favourite themes - revenge, guilt death, Park made gritty, visceral yet stylish film didn't shy away pushing violence, sex strong sexual themes places hadn't to. Obviously, remake film one loves much awaited strange mix excitement trepidation. Add fact remake helmed director Inside Man - highly underrated film, opinion; yes, Spike Lee's Oldboy keenly awaited, despite remake film that, ideal world, shouldn't touched. Unfortunately - problem remakes - Lee's adaptation miss, doesn't seem capture soul original. Surprisingly enough, even Sanjay Gupta's Zinda, faithful 'tribute' - put politely - stylized, heavily watered-down version it, actually wee bit intriguing Lee given us. Even haven't already watched original Hindi remake, you'll probably already know film man is, without reason, held captive long, long period time, then, mysteriously, released. Except, man angry. And wants answers. Even attempting judge film itself, independent original, one can't help see right start flawed approach film is. The protagonist, Joe Doucett, presented us man questionable morals. Not 'grey', mind you, every human - 'charcoal', will. That automatically makes particularly care he's imprisoned. Also, Joe imprisoned period humankind seen kind change - lifestyle technology - unprecedented. Thus, steps out, world appear alien disorientation fundamental part personality. Instead using obvious character attribute, get hints Joe unaware Google touchscreens. He, however, seems quite adept cracking answers questions that, logically, shouldn't even know ask. Another important aspect film fails get even close right Joe's physical emotional transformation must be, length captivity. Park's Oh Dae-Su goes almost-portly man approaching middle-age, lean fighting machine, wish revenge drives him. You feel physical transformation; feel burning desire revenge. Everything Spike Lee's remake superficial - emotions, Joe's journey quest answers, Josh Brolin's interpretation Joe, it. If one area, however, film manages different yet equal original, post-climactic resolution. Lee's ending significantly plausible Park's. Then again, Park's film audacity. It almost worthy case study, exact plot seem audaciously original nerve-wracking one film, cloyingly far-fetched another. Brolin tries hard Joe, he's ultimately always Brolin. Elizabeth Olsen, who's sight while, refreshing Marie, Joe's unlikely companion quest answers. She looks simple yet lovely, also seems like finally learnt step cutesy Michelle we've always known as, slip real adult character. Sharlto Copley, seen earlier year one antagonists Elysium, seems quite adept playing manic villain, even though isn't significant value addition film. It doesn't help Indian censors clearly mutilated film well. A lot violence sex scenes chopped off, though still substantial amount film, bits cut portions truly held emotional crux story. But, really, even including wouldn't able substantially lift essentially mediocre, disappointing film. The next time Hollywood wants attempt remake Asian thriller, check Martin Scorsese done, first.
