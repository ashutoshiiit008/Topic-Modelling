Isn't shame woman wronged obnoxious man I feel bad conceptually? Only imagination must like evokes kind emotion me? And first half hour film. My exasperation gets worse Hate Story progresses. In entire film, two things okay. One Gulshan Devaiya's stammer attempt making story business-mind game. But barely things I call 'work' 'are going film'. They happen able say least things nice film. Okay fine, Nikhil Dwivedi broods right. Talking Paoli Dam's performance would involve recalling whispering sighing attempt seduce, I'm trying best resist. And..."ha ha ha ha ha ha" ROFL went expecting sizzling, explicit sex based promos. Little know they've seen see trailer itself. In fact, uncensored version trailer even little film. And another, "ha ha ha ha ha ha" - wondering, even slightest moment, Hate Story would finally Hindi film shows two people comfortable bodies sex. Now, whole idea behind lead lady turn top-notch call-girl obviously able market film. Then, I giving much benefit doubt thinking, "Sure didn't tell exactly HAD turn prostitute, maybe easiest way get wanted." One thing Hate Story god job of, expose fragility male ego. One male another falls woman whose focus revenge one relents even know truth her. But again, don't need see movie that, you? runs shelter Oh, selling point trailer seemed free use cuss words. Character character uses f-word awkwardly 12-year olds use language. Unfortunately, everything Hate Story sounds looks contrived sole motivation getting audience theater - hook crook. And doesn't quite work.
