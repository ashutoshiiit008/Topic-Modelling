Which gray characters seem distant. You can't sense desperation. That none characters wrong one certainly right beautiful. But, begin get nuances character sense frustration, narrative shifts another time place both. This disorienting, especially towards end. Besides however technique story-telling used effectively pique interest. The hard work goes details editing apparent. Where exactly cut one sub-plot ever important movie. While cuts worked times seemed adversely effected pacing towards end. Strangers offers another great performance Kay Kay Menon. And pleasure see Jimmy Shergill role talent justice.

Use close-ups bring focus expressions speaker dramatic moments seemed purposeful thus created necessary impact. The lighting used tastefully. The decision go stylistic narrative route slow pace along 90 minute run-time taken toll character development. An interesting plot loses steam urge many things little time.
