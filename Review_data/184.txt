Roman Polanski’s latest offering, Carnage, based play Yasmina Reza, unique film. Unique, unlike almost every film ever made, entire film (apart opening closing credits) plays real time. So, 80 minutes spend cinema equals 80 minutes stellar cast spend film. What makes Carnage delight sharp dialogues, delivered finely together plaster silly smirk face film, provided pay attention. A perfectly innocuous (if little violent) fight two kids New York neighborhood escalated parents. The parents being, well, ‘parents’, attempt resolve issue ‘mature’ manner, trying talk themselves. So, Longstreets, played Jodie Foster John C. Reilly call Cowans (Kate Winslet Christoph Waltz) home. Over coffee, cobbler eventually, scotch, facades quite ungracefully pulled couple’s relationship unravels seams, character’s quirks begin surface rather ‘dramedic’ manner (if I may coin word.) What marvelous way one rarely ever feels sense discontinuity proceedings. It hard believe film shot ‘film’ continuous one-act play multi-cam setup. Perhaps thing really gives away visually changing colour Kate Winslet’s lipstick. Over course film, everything, pseudo-political ideology gender stereotypes, discussed characters. What interesting note certain situations cause certain people group together irrespective much dislike others’ personalities. Carnage is, sense, perfect study urban human behavior. The film made watchable actors made pump credibility parts like ever do. Jodie Foster incredible seemingly mature aspiring writer soft corner sufferers atrocities Darfur. Her character strange graph film, though goes level-headed hyperactive within seconds, deserves full marks making look natural. Even level-headedness, one could easily make exactly bubbling surface. John C. Reilly hardware store owner husband perhaps weakest cast, still competent typical man believes problems men sorted way ‘men solve problems’. Kate Winslet plays career woman forced look domestic problems husband indifferent towards matters ‘expects’ take care it. Like Jodie Foster’s character, also see-sawing graph requires immense understanding art ‘being’ character. Needless say, Winslet excels. My personal favourite film immensely talented Christoph Waltz BlackBerry addict attorney forced part proceedings ‘father’ one children involved. His BlackBerry seems buzz precisely moment shouldn’t, every single time, response it, though same, priceless. While title Carnage makes sound like “I’m Duke Nukem, I’m gonna blast beep beep” film, carnage metaphysical. A classic character study, insightful, quirky immensely entertaining. Though necessarily big screen watch terms visuals, Carnage film ideally enjoyed crowd. It real pity crowds clearly flocking theatres one.
