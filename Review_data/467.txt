I must confess outset I haven’t read Lee Child’s novels, I inherent knowledge fondness character Jack Reacher, played Tom Cruise film. I’ve heard, though, die-hard fans books character felt, right time announcement, Tom Cruise bad fit Reacher; research tell certainly doesn’t match physical attributes character. Well, one big problems Jack Reacher, film, cinematic Reacher doesn’t come across character worth die-hard fan first place. A daring murder five seemingly random people broad daylight leads arrest ex-military sniper clearly looks guilty shocking crime. However, murder ends getting Jack Reacher, ex-military investigator embroiled case, crime seems far murkier looked like surface. On plus side, film constant sense mystery it. Not treated like one would normally expect big-budget, Hollywood action film treated, film unfolds slowly, without fanfare. So, new facts faces uncovered time, doesn’t really announce dwell long them. The background music also surprisingly held check, long bits silence embellished nothing gentle ambient sound. The result kind thriller relies mood atmosphere work charms, rather grand unveils good ol’ ‘big twist’ two. Also, action refreshing change one used seeing big Hollywood stars big films. It grittier, personal, hand-to-hand combat precision-sniping rather cable-propelled, gravity-defying slambang-ery prevalent films mounted scale. That lead hero’s charms make seem intense, less ‘in face’. However, film gains terms mood, loses writing. The plot like old-school American spy film. The screenplay enough flaws raises enough fundamental questions poke away continuously real time, brain processing it. That combined fact everyone seems taking characters far seriously film makes want to, every while, tap character shoulder ask them, “You’re kidding me, right?” Cruise seems seems understood real tone treatment like. He perpetual, all-knowing poker face him; like he’s teasing audience feeling actually knows what’s going playing us along fun it. If rest characters interpreted portrayed, could actually made fun watch. The character Reacher seems rather bland uninteresting, made wonder following first place. I guess answered actually reading books. The cast member evokes reaction, presence rather acting skill, great Werner Herzog plays shady, comic-book-ish operator. Rosamund Pike looks lovely performs earnestly, even faces problem taking film far seriously. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie hasn’t done much wrong ‘Jack Reacher’. The problem really lies fact hasn’t done much right either. The next years see collaborate Cruise quite often; name already attached next Mission: Impossible film, well Top Gun sequel. Hopefully he’ll get act together time manage use larger-than-life movie star far better manner. Jack Reacher kind film hardcore fans Cruise (such myself) would quite like. Others may like calm, intense dark tone, I don’t see many people blown away film.
