A couple deep inside Rajasthan loses hopes livelihood village move city hopes, Mumbai. Given texture film, know going suffer. A lot. Before get respite, all. Now, know going heavily bank details comes performances. One delivers, much. There's better way put - difficulties lives Deepak (Rajkummar Rao) Rakhee (Patralekha) come easily. Yes, given value system asked pretty horrendous things. But, don't see resistance. You don't see looking better options stooping low (by standards). This I lost interest film, despite liking pace things playing out. Then I wondered Deepak Rakhee made generalizations immigrants city. While times stereotypes work, times clich√© work harder create impact. And end, Citylights nothing. Every while, becomes story particular person, Deepak. And times, engage, quickly slips back sad story people outside city gullible city get them. I going go argument whether non-city-dwellers less unaware world works city-dwellers dupe former. For I believe level, want believe nothing bad happen us smarten changes to, I'm smarter now, nothing bad happen me. Similarly, us agree cheat push comes shove. The problem convinced push come shove Deepak Rakhee's case. The thing keeping film interesting performances. Rajkummar Rao Manav Kaul thoroughly engaging, especially Manav Kaul. It might character too. The shade grey, frustration reasons interesting. Patralekha hand well she's asked do. How I wish character better depth explore acting skills. Then background score songs. They hinder instead help. Somehow, film's ambience isn't congruous music. The music pretty mediocre too. They sounded like belonged Bhatt film setting wanted Aamir zone. That I think bane. Citylights tries two things time things cannot go together. True keeps setting real performances support theme. But, that, doesn't engage. Just film morose grim, doesn't qualify one reaches deep within. It good enough realistic setting performances. The story make believe too. That Citylights misses.
