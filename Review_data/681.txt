What aim life? To find happiness. What makes one happy? Money / fame / power / smaller things life. What happens you've experienced that? You satisfied temporarily magically find something else could make happier. Repeat. This aspect human nature explored Oh, My God!!. The character situation chosen exaggerated thus seem unrealistic bizarre way. And surreal style narration turn brings metaphors focus. Vinay Pathak, ambitious, common man whose hopes attached multi-level marketing scheme, makes empathize also makes identify character. You gradually see replacing desires yours, even scoffing 'scheme'. Yet, romance one area seems like misfit. Divya Dutta, screen-wife didn't look comfortable either. Though, individual performer made small problems real. The one-line story - man aspires financial growth actually finds money, he's satisfied - sounds immature, even child-like. But realize 'aim life' actually symbolic, experience gets meatier. You could actually replace 'need money' anything else result would same. When achieve it, you'd complain manner got it. If okay that, you'll lose sleep even sanity trying protect it. And true loftier desires. Even person happy little things life, satisfaction one little need replaced another little need. And issues over-dramatized, brought story progresses. The dialogues start fresh become preachy lines, albeit masked, end. Yet events last half hour seem like to-do list - hurried culmination taking time develop. Also, something gone grossly wrong 90-minute movie seems like drag parts. The grainy texture (low-budget induced?) lack straight-regular camera angles increased amount patience required watching movie. The continuous use bottom-up/top-down/wide-angle distracting. It's always exciting see screen others make lives especially attempt heavy, "what for?" question. And someone like Vinay Pathak take it, it's pleasure. Yet, narrative seems incomplete quick speech farewell note doesn't help either.
