When walk film called "The Xpos√©" know word stand skin-show big reveal equally, aren't really walking many expectations. I actually look forward line two entertain/engage least amuse me. No luck. Oh wait, Himesh Reshammiya's character Ravi obnoxious amusing, till gets annoying. But, till then, I awe person thought arrogant style protagonist. So, I rooting character, supposedly mean good. I don't care falls love willing her. Considering murder mystery, you'd think made care victim. But, asked, neigh begged, judge negatively first frame shows in. And big "expose" happens, don't care either. Sure, writer tried hard make huge reveal, doesn't matter enough. In addition, goes overboard increasing tension. Yes, additional drama terms slo-mo scenes dramatic background score. But, also story-wise goes says once, "not yet, there's more." The performances perfunctory get. To rub salt wound, Irrfan Khan voiceover. The setting 70s doesn't work all. The songs, well either, Yo Yo Honey Singh Himesh Reshammiya singer. So, there's looking respite there. The sliver lining - short film. And come day people generally, likely care even less usual - let alone read review.
