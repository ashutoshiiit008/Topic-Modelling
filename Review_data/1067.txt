There time seemed like many X-Men films coming out. After original trilogy, fifth film franchise, X-Men: First Class, featured all-new cast, narrated origin stories Professor X Magneto. The film, luckily, breathed life franchise. The seventh film now, (two Wolverine films also appeared along way,) X-Men: Days Future Past, brings cast characters original trilogy well First Class terrific way - hooking plot makes invest X-Men like never before. In dystopian future, X-Men hunted killed machines known Sentinels, X-Men simply match. Professor X Magneto come ingenious solution Sentinal menace. With horde Marvel films coming lately, becoming increasing difficult make film stand out. The last them, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, fun film, albeit one still basic plot. In fact, stories films either stand pale away; nothing separates terms scale execution. With original director Bryan Singer coming back helm, Days Future Past thrills bangs alright, really plot. The time travel aspect, urgency characters' actions, ambiguity motives characters appearing past present - keeps engaged along. Even though film seems borrow much many films recent past - example, Matrix Inception déjà vu moments sprinkled film - fact remains set X-Men universe unique set characters, works well. The ensemble cast works even better, many them. Hugh Jackman made Wolverine own, he's terrific. And there's great joy thought Michael Fassbender Sir Ian McKellen portraying past future versions film. Ditto James McAvoy Patrick Stewart. Jennifer Lawrence, expectedly much better shape First Class, gets meaty part makes count. One slight disappointment isn't much stands jaw-dropping set piece department, we've seen much already. But watch one incredibly clever scene involving lightning-fast reflexes Peter Maximoff (or Quicksilver). With final tiny post-credits scene, stage set 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse. Days Future Past set tone future nicely.
