This yet another summer movie, one purports even better bigger terms special effects CGI call days! (Aren’t all!)? Directed Michael Bay, big budget, louder ever, crash second movie genre, Transformers trite, banal, hackneyed. Based set toys made Hasbro popular around twenty years ago US A (aren’t better sources inspiration around?), Transformers machines, machines, machines. The movie wet dream technology freaks dream absolute power technological domination. We lovingly shot sequences planes, tanks, guns, black glistening, hard throbbing, filled deadly intent. We shots alien robots, amazingly anthropomorphic, (how come, machine intelligences alien planet) right lubricating fluid outlets (did get one?) metamorphosing sleek transport machines – trailer trucks, Ford Camarro, fighter jet unnamables, lest viewers get bored even second. And make rest film, action scenes involving robots men, robots versus robots, robots running amok deserts Qatar destroying good old American military technology. Yes, humans scattered film, largely inconsequential. We nerdy Sam Witwicky, something alien robots want hidden top-secret location, obligatory local female hot bod Mikaela Banes, Sam’s parents, course, pet Chihuahua. We Jon Voight playing Secretary Defence, (in must lousiest role career) substituting shadow President. What get reasonable plot, character development, rationale destruction see screen. The film tedium personified special effects Industrial Light Magic cannot save it, I could relate characters. Yes, humans end saving world setting things right, none interest me, I seen before. The camera jerks amazingly action sequences, cinematographer trying convey body hallucinogenic experience viewer. The sub text America American technology saving world, automobile pumped phallic symbol would set women drooling leave men free really want, sex attractive women. To complete picture, embodiment techno freak fantasy humans coexisting peacefully technology created, become complex mystifying, totally alien. The movie cost something around 150 million dollars, word goes, one wonders whether larger fraction could invested bound shooting script getting hold real actors! The audience film assumed IQ slightly smaller shoe size, well, I guess really matter. The pre pubescent crowd might enjoy film given jokes masturbatory habits young, pheromone oozing males, scene Mikaela drapes Sam’s automobile hood, inspects engine, makes appreciative noises pumps, heads, power!!
