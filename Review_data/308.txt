With stunning visuals gorgeously executed animation you’ll see, you’d think makers Epic would perhaps invest tad bit writing ensure film becomes memorable experience viewer. Sadly enough, isn’t case. So, you’re always enjoying animation part film, you’re also always conscious film isn’t nearly exciting enough truly hooked by. Yet another film based book, time one titled ‘The Leaf Men Brave Good Bugs’ William Joyce, film mixture coming-of-age tale, underdog story, fantasy adventure even tiny little teen romance. It recounts adventures Mary Katherine MK, teenage girl whose new life woods formerly estranged father takes turn fantastic crosses paths group miniscule warriors called Leaf Men, locked perpetual war bug-creatures known Boggans. It becomes quite hard truly taken film predict almost every step way. MK’s initial apprehensions moving father, encounters Leaf Men, path story follows, almost something even least involved audiences able predict ease. In fact, film wasn’t embellished kind top-notch animation is, would downright boring. Even humour film, something usually strong animations films, largely insipid uninspiring. The film, like lot animation films, message within well. It talks universal conflict ‘them’ ‘us’, divisions cause planet deserves peace, constant state flux. It also attempts play age-old emotions young man woman coming age, rising challenge eventually coming trumps. Thus, film heart clean, honest attempt fantasy adventure, becomes hard dismiss many flaws has. The film also ensemble cast voices characters, though I must confess one big name cast quite disappointed firstly choice, secondly execution. Amanda Seyfried, voices MK, fairly good job girl caught war fight good, even though isn’t fight all. She manages evoke right mix hesitation confidence journey film. Colin Farrell Ronin, leader Leaf Men excellent well. It took wrap head around idea mature calming voice I hearing Farrell. The big disappointment Christoph Waltz Mandrake, leader Boggans. Waltz’s voice accent didn’t suit character first place. Yet, I expected lift sheer presence, unfortunately doesn’t happen. None voices particularly memorable, save perhaps Jason Sudeikis, voices MK’s father. From Blue Sky, studio behind Ice Age films Rio, directed Chris Wedge, man directed first Ice Age film, animation one thing makes Epic watchable despite poor writing mostly just-functional voice casting. The forest environment, atmosphere created lighting, execution action scenes, absolutely everything technical film superb. Even early part end credits set beautiful little animation sequence makes stay till end. However, fact effort put animation little developing funny heartwarming story core broke heart once. It isn’t easy tell someone Epic film easily missed; that, unfortunately, sad truth it.
