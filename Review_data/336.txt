The sequel 2009 film G.I. Joe: The Rise Cobra, G. I. Joe: Retaliation pretty much picks previous film left off. This time though, number new characters join old continue battle, Joes’ sworn enemy, organization known Cobra, also threat within US Government itself. A film makes last week’s Olympus Has Fallen look like Citizen Kane, film much continuous series implausible situations action set pieces mostly numb sensory abilities time, post film. Now, expecting logic G. I. Joe film like expecting cow-dung Sajid Khan film, really makes worse one big draw film – largest face posters film, Bruce Willis - huge disappointment hardly it. He breezily aces scenes he’s in, doubt, leaves wanting more. The rest film largely exhausting quite predictable, terms plot well execution. When President United States sends G. I. Joe team tactical operation Pakistan, things go awry, entire team annihilated, save Roadblock, Flint Lady Jaye (none appeared first film). What’s worse, entire G. I. Joe outfit branded traitors. It survivors erase blot name dead compatriots, hunt people responsible deception. What I always failed understand big Hollywood action extravaganzas writers directors don’t seem feel need pace film right, give graph draw audience make feel rise fall emotions, even purely exhilaration action real feelings towards characters. The film maintains breathless pace throughout, rarely taking foot action pedal. The result film becomes repetitive tiresome while. Also, though could purely subjective certain image mind, seemed director Jon M. Chu quite directing large-scale action films. (Jon M. Chu directed last two Step Up films.) Even film whose foundation suspension disbelief, action truly work viewer make sense it. Retaliation’s sequences massively mounted actually imaginative vision, shoddily executed, relying fast-moving objects rapid cuts distract viewers rather involve them. It doesn’t help seem want cast non-actors G. I. Joe films. Dwayne Johnson Roadblock likeable presence that’s it. No one else comes even close making sort impact, unless one counts scenes Adrianne Palicki, plays Lady Jaye, wears clothes meant show her, let’s say, feminine side. The big disappointment, one I still can’t get considering large face splashed promotions film, tiny role offered Bruce Willis. Here’s man knows kick backsides screen, use full? The film make slightly better use 3D films far. Largely subtle, odd shots shrapnel even people flying directly you, 3D doesn’t jar much usually tends to. Still, I think time Hollywood figures 3D isn’t something really excites viewers enough want pay premium dim vision it. Not torturous last Die Hard film still nowhere close exciting action film, G. I. Joe: Retaliation really hardcore exclusive action film fans. But like who’ve grown G. I. Joe action figures WWE, us made far better action films heads, starring plastic playmates, you’re always disappointed Dwayne Johnson doesn’t go Rock Bottom-ing People’s Elbow-ing bad guys.
