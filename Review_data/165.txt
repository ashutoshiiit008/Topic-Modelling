Could better way pay tribute something, making contribution it? Better yet, makers' passion medium shows work. So, show love director went comfort zone? Or one always best - engage us adding quirk simplest stories? Or two - tells story compassionate father makes son shine despite father? Or talk discontent missing overdone? Karan Johar steps glamorous shoes must quite difficult. To resort lip-sync song out-of-place dance must effort - even though perfect enough excuse one, two characters (Rani Mukerji Saqib Saleem) working Bollywood gossip. In fact, contrast three films, form short film refers Bollywood songs yesteryears dialogue. To top off, looks like wasn't allowed take trip snow-capped Europe, much relief. (Boy, must toughie Karan Johar!) Yet, chic story terms ambiance gets play around relatively upper class parts Bombay. That's glossy gets. Though Karan Johar's quarter Bombay Talkies seems like personal short films, over-eager. His account homosexual man meets woman hits with, felt like story dying tell. That passion desensitize Indian audience taboo film great. But, came hard - great. Unfortunately, again, Johar's approach gay world brought sniggers worse, 'eeewwws' 'yucks'. Once done weakest films terms stories, Dibaker Banerjee's film struggler (Nawazzudin Siddiqui) takes pride struggles. Till shown shortcomings hallucination. This part movie two sequences film rather film itself. One, surreal setting lead character forced face reality. And lovely tribute silent cinema. Of course, many smaller things discover others don't connect, bits stay you. Bombay Talkies love cinema deepens Zoya Akhtar's Naman, child stifled ambitions father. Like many people I know real life, Naman made lonely ignored parents takes refuge Bollywood. The God-like stature assigns favorite star logical next step. Zoya's gently slaps us society, twice. Once comment parents force ambitions children also corner kids lying them. Then, us society produces goes popularize songs shouldn't heard seen kids ten. It amazing clap children dance numbers. Her soft indirect touch controversial topic like transvestites too, pretty brave. And best saved last. You trust Anurag Kashyap combine two disparate topics finesse - fanaticism fans stars unquestioning regard parents wishes. He celebrates taunts aspects one go. Yet, simplest story all. Even though feels tad long, pace build-up climax beautiful. Vineet Kumar Singh Vijay looks like another Kashyap's finds ought watch for. His desperation persistence alone makes section worth watch. And course, bonuses along way. All builds promotional song I hated first time I saw YouTube. But, flow film completely different feel it. Also, version I saw earlier didn't complete version, left charming old times. Yet, deserved better green-screen patch job got last bit. And signature tune assigned current generation actors still didn't work. So, Karan Johar's story man's struggle sexuality might impressive terms far he's come box, Dibaker Banerjee & Zoya Akhtar's stories warm nicely tributes love cinema, Anurag Kashyap's bitter-sweet reference reverence stars easily one I'd like watch again. Now, it's difficult put favoritism director aside asked compare. But, again, given context, I'm allowed that. ;)
