Loot starts old plot four wannabe thugs setting loot something other. They four almost alike comes characteristics quirks. They loud, crack wannabe jokes, objectify women sing dance good reason. Their world full thugs encounter kind even go new world. And slowly Loot couple twists becomes marginally interesting mainly weren't expecting story thrown you. I actually felt grateful even though story convoluted hold interest long. But let's better nothing, surely was. Loot also came across confused film acting dialogue run-of-the-mill slapstick, texture, tone film classier overall plot little meat usual. Loot one films could stop flipping channels, ridicule non-sense going on-screen, get frustrated can't make sense move on.
