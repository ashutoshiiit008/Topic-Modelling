Maximum depressing. It looks like play two policemen neither top department lowest ranks, decent amount power each. But indeed, many more, important characters. Like umpteen underworld films war good evil, wrong right. It human beings, shade gray. That makes perfect 'enjoyable story' material despite lack relatable characters root for. Yet, get sadness overwhelms watch police officers goons do, authority, realize one gang war films. And that's depressing bit Maximum. That war two policemen nothing short gang war - thematically morally. Of course, I'm saying shown film comes shock. If goonism business politics; politics goonism business, come surprise goonism, business politics within law enforcement. Yet, made uncomfortable policemen shot goons others' informers one pay another save informer. For discomfort, good performances, good start, Maximum might worth while, looking forward it. On hand, except first half hour so, lot dramatization, lots motifs symbols thrown face many pitfalls director falls in, trying cool things one film. Maximum spreads thin even terms giving space characters. It always tough task justice main characters even small roles, especially played good actors. From Naseeruddin Shah Sonu Sood Dr. Mohan Agashe, Vinay Pathak Rajendra Gupta, Neha Dhupia, Amit Sadh - one make believe character. Most make feel small level, lot film 'goon' story heart. Even though cannot satisfied exposure given characters, appreciate attempt giving depth. Which lack detail Naseeruddin Shah's character, Inamdaar, seems unfair. While know almost Sonu Sood's Pandit, little know Inamdaar's background, character motivations. And despite shortcomings, Maximum plays well interesting story, especially beginning meat story lies. Close interval, pace drops never picks that. The soporific background music constant use slow-motion doesn't help. Neither constant punctuation item numbers guise policemen's dance bar visits. I also liked symbolic survival innocence, honesty(?) loyalty. Maximum felt like interesting story tell got lost way amongst lots intriguing characters many things tell. A little prioritization might allowed writer director focus story about.
