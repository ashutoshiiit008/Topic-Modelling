An excess anything causes indigestion. Then may loud drums violins trying follow pace heart-beat close-ups / top bottom angles. Note I even complaining bloodshed gore. In fact, I missed profanity. Hard core Mumbai goons abuse? The things make Risk watchable fantastic performances twists plot. The story nothing new. Two gangs wanting beat primary business conduct. But, scores way beat other. Through two hours, audience wondering, “oops…now get one?” drama do. The issue end leave anyone surprised. Watch marvelous performances. Randeep Hooda need prove genre, certainly mastered serious character - dialogue delivery, timing. Vinod Khanna plays part elegance style. The rest supporting cast looks perfect roles too. Oh yes, Tanushree Dutta too, there? I pretty sure, forget role movie, soon. What earth song like ‘hichki’ movie like this? It point-blank out-of-place! Are desperate please masses bring absolutely out-of-place love angle Miss India qualms gratuitous show skin? ‘out-of-place’ phrase seems right place! Vishram Sawant uses music cover conversations audience don’t really need listen to. The technique used ‘D’. Surely, problem reusing technique earlier movie, movie? Was lack talent dialogue department? Sort-of. There really good dialogues mixed regular, forgettable lines. Agreed, like love triangles, many ways gang-wars treated. But, today need something, something make movie stand out. And Risk misses. Or maybe time director move another genre…
