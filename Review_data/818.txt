If get past delicate-yet-rugged sari-clad woman, stomping around slums shooting people sight, Shabri another underworld/gangster movie. The old tiff factions within gangs, old fragility cops goons. Only difference woman gets caught good reason. When done watching Shabri, realize whatever reason get Shabri (Eesha Koppikhar) involved hoodlums somehow could get angry young woman involved. It's like wasn't interesting conflict. Shabri get soup estranging police underworld don. And wonder going wade out. Even though uninvolved, curious bystander would be. But unfortunately, resolution simplistic laugh cop-out. And shame much potential get attached. A woman, whose life isn't enviable is, wronged (for change it's rape once). The hurt makes stronger uses anger change one might accepted destiny. I think sort-of wasted opportunity Eesha Koppikhar. Who would've imagined cast role like this? But unfortunately made hold one expression film. And rare occasions emotes little smirk, realize capable much more. On hand, Shabri going through, I cannot imagine anything dead/blank look. Otherwise, tan make-up distracting too. It managed disguise glamor usually carries, stride, somehow looked artificial, put-on sake camera. Shabri grim brown. At times, even tiring much concentrate figure what's happening low light. The tone given regular gang-war story serious too. Even looking forward story woman gangster, I'd say isn't something worth getting excited about.
