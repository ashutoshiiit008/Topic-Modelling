I won’t ever forget 11-year-old reacted news Lady Diana’s death. My first, instant reaction – I said aloud – was, “Good riddance.” My rather insensitive reaction quite tragic piece news - I remember clear daylight – I thought someone whose claim fame married Prince Wales, seemed present one photo op many. And days didn’t even access kind 24 x 7 news channels like today. It took years realize hardly fault; sometimes fame chases even don’t want it. I must confess I intrigued charismatic personality extraordinarily eventful life ever since. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel’s film Princess Diana covers last two years life, fell kind love isn’t meant be, day tragic death Paris, sent waves shock around world. Hirschbiegel’s terrific 2004 film Downfall similarly based last days life highly controversial public figure. The maturity, however, treated film seemed lacking Diana. When you’re making film life personality like Princess Diana, you’re always walking thin line. Everyone shades grey, celebrity status, shades assume mammoth proportions, never quite know you’re headed recounting life. Perhaps intent makers Diana capture various shades enigma she, unfortunately, comes across far sanitized version last years life. The problem film, really, lies fact never tell tale told from. Is vantage point objective third person? Is perspective Lady herself? Or point view someone middle – someone knew well enough know certain intimate parts life, yet close enough completely trust? As struggle trying figure out, you’re left images scenes idealistic woman saw everything black white. She either victim savior, never person. The Diana film often comes across idealistic little girl trapped shell fame; shell she’d loved break away from. Whether actually that, one never know, surely painting world broad strokes little justice life lived, travails doubtlessly endured. If Diana still film watched least once, Naomi Watts. Now Watts looks nothing like Diana far facial features concerned. However, ever often, when, film, face slight silhouette, passes camera flash, even gently focus, I couldn’t help see Diana her. Combine regal gait, Watts convinces certainly wasn’t miscast. The slightly-out-of-shape Naveen Andrews brave choice character Dr. Hasnat Khan. The fact isn’t ruggedly masculine, chiseled man playing character lends air authenticity. Still, various reasons, Diana far shallow film truly go memorable look Lady Diana’s life. The good news, however, still leaves window open someone else attempt another cinematic crack fascinating life one enduring women ever.
