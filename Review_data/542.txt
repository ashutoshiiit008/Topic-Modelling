Scene 1 bad (read notepad), I thought, "Oh cool, things get better!". But, makers took challenge went worse worst time. So much so, I inspired. I taken challenge good movie. Therefore, I try best refrain words like - clich√©s, cinematic liberties, inanities, contrived, predictable, unoriginal like. Not good start now, that? So, morning, I visited beautiful South Africa taken walking tour dazzling Cape Town without ever there. Thanks Kajal (Ayesha Takia) prefers walking even though owns car. Kudos Ayesha taking job. Having around brought back fond memories Dor really capable of. The actors meet expectations. The phrase "the less said better" comes mind. Since I trying focus hard "better", I choose say "less". One thing sure, surely room getting bored monotony. The characters lot say way profound dialogues love life. Yes, clueless want life. But many us real life, right? And every time dialogues start getting heavy Arjun's (Tusshar Kapoor) friends show comic relief crack "the" joke. Dutifully, main characters creep reminding love story slapstick. The lack monotony also credited decent sounding songs. Copied, I hear say? The originality, dear friends, saved lyricist. Honestly (not I dishonest far), best attempt poetry recent times. The choreography, gives confidence make another attempt dancing. It's pretty mechanical, all. Have successful keeping challenge, I? Hey, cut slack. This first attempt positive positively bad movie. Worry not. Such attempts far between. I good nice long. The nastiness back next bad movie generated.
