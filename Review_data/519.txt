Kidnap raise interesting questions. What small big unintentional mistake? Who decides proportionate punishment? What punishment disproportionate? To extent injustice set right? What set right? Maybe straight answers theoretically. Now wronged person? What stakes made higher child/ person closest heart involved? But, tug-of-war asking questions adding commercial masala, latter pulled harder. And decent story not-so-decent execution. Despite superficial presentation, it's intriguing see movie balancing gray zone. There's hero villain. At two anti-heroes. You can't hate love either them, somehow aren't indifferent either. You want know they've learnt, they've changed end events. Sanjay Dutt perfectly balances street-smart, conniving businessman, Vikrant Raina vulnerable father. True Kabir (Imran Khan) written good detail, supposed cynical all. But eagerness stylize character Imran Khan's dialogue delivery comes across forced. The mid-sentence pauses meant add attitude, manage add unnaturalness. The narrative, Imran's performance, show wrong harsh decision one person affect another person's life. So much latter obsessed completely bringing person emotionally. Unfortunately though, parts writing department leave gaps narrative. There courtesy smart lines thrown full dose inanities. What point clues? It wasn't one leading another. How clues solved clarified. And later clues even cryptic - direct messages. Then even call clue? Also, women ring too, reasonable-sized screen presence; characters aren't really serving deeper purpose. Minissha Lamba absolutely behaves like 18 year old spoilt brat, certainly doesn't look like one. How many ever wet-scenes-in-white however unclad is, doesn't ooze oomph. Skin show in-the-face generally something ungraceful here. Her inelegant dance moves don't help either. And certainly cannot take Kareena Kapoor, Amisha Patel even Aishwarya Rai department. I'm still shock seeing Vidya Malavade play Minissha's mom! Though it's courageous move, deep-necked business suits capitalized rather acting skills. So, sum total cleavage tasteless rather functional. The movie doesn't carry rugged look promos have. It color-saturated feel. That kidnapped full wardrobe - matching shoes included - disposal adds feel. Did kidnapper go shopping her? Or take pit-stop home way going hide her? And changed clothes first time? These things wouldn't usually make review, blatant add significantly already unrealistic feel. Oh yeah, enough engagements wedding anniversaries thrown songs lousy music. Unrealistic advantages though. A couple actions scenes really well choreographed thought out. Bikes cars made imaginative stunts. And human beings aren't left out. The chase scene set under-construction building actually Imran Spiderman moves. If only, could resisted over-stylizing it. Or maybe hangover director's last endeavor Dhoom 2 first step towards actual story action-thriller.
