I really like trend combining commercial cinema believability. Where full advantage taken liberties given art form yet major leaps faith required. The one main thing makers ask little benefit doubt character transformations towards end. But enjoyed enough give them. It's musical, neither great acting demanded delivered. Everybody bit without going over-the-top that's stick to. It interesting rather commendable although Madhuri heart soul movie, realize Madhuri watching Dia. The gripping script deserves much credit woman herself. She aging gracefully, it's great playing mother 10-12 year old posing college student. I really glad didn't work hard covering blemishes face. Makes earthly. Fortunately, story her. And movie magical smile wonderful eyes. Focus one character makes movie plain. Anyway, nothing remarkable character. Aaja Nachle comment onslaught commercialization. About politicians businessmen play together achieve whatever fancies whim. It also attempt show new educated breed politicians use power make difference will. And running background, preaching. All-in-all, pretty decent fare feel good movie. After long while, really long while, I thinking, "oh cool, it's even interval yet" instead "oh crap, it's even interval yet." The first half engrossing. And script safe hands Jaideep Sahni comforting thought interval. "Even drops, it's going plummet bottom." And drop does. The second half seemed rushed. The little nuances characters I admired beginning mish-mashed lost end. But, 20-minute grand finale form play makes that. What spectacle! Yes, don't let forget watching movie Yash Raj money pouring it, play. The edits, camera movements, art design work towards that...and spectacle!! The lyrics, music, performances, costumes, colors, choreography make wish eyes didn't need blink. And makes extra half hour (over standard two-hour length) acceptable. The audience theater clapping play. It's almost makers anticipated left brilliantly timed pause end play. Is befitting who's Indian "parallel" cinema asked sing dance? Because characters movie also unlikely dance. Who would imagined Ranvir Shorey, Vinay Pathak, Konkana Sen Sharma would part musical? Or producer wanted say, "See, I made dance too!" I wonder. Is becoming formula Yash Raj Films? One "star" whose name pull crowds good, relatively low profile actors form rest cast - shouldn't mind/should exposure average, feel-good script dialogues balance humor, charming believability, profundity Just observation, complaining...not yet.
