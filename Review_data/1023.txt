Munnabhai MBBS, Patch Adams, Anand films come mind within first minutes Vaada Raha. Ok, changes there. And don't use exactly tricks. But deviation seems like formality. The first change course little boy one protagonists. Which could worked talking thinking like adult. I imagine character age, who's already going bad patch life, would become little philosophical age. But seeing use clich√©d language oldies creativity would, made one thing - cringe. Given that, Dwij Yadav plays little boy, carries cute self ups downs days aimless Dr. Duke (Bobby Deol). Unfortunately, doesn't look like learnt acting film. He's done done far. This best I've seen Bobby Deol act. Yeah, it's mean way I say this. He actually emotes anger helplessness. Once done rest cakewalk. More less Nanhe Jaisalmer's team cast crew don't quite get us involved vaada raha. Neither adults kids make us love hate them. They going motions expected drill audience - go, watch emotionlessly, get-up, go.
