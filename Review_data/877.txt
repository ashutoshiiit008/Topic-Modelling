The movie opens man standing middle lush green farm. And realize going commit suicide, contrast rich field poor man hits like bolt. No people, spoiler, it's true life story. It's story 150000 farmers who've killed themselves. We've already read newspapers. But visual stay us while. Another contrast strikes scene cuts three men behaving like boys. Arrogant "kewl", Carefree irresponsible, wannabe dependent (Sikandar, Arjan Bajwa, Alekh Sangal). Yes, characters three friends defined 5 minutes. Similarly, two lead women, one epitome things motherly, almost exact opposite etched us next 10 minutes (Gul Panag Uvika Choudhary). Later, introduced village doctor (Ashutosh Rana) too, sense despite helplessness, he's trying help best possible manner. Most credit clear definitions goes writing. The casual aptly light lines beginning course done justice delivery. But, somehow, heavy tinge artificiality performances except Gul Ashutosh. Gul cute momly figure love annoy breathtakingly well-performed scene last half hour. Ashutosh Rana's performance shows new facet talent. It refreshing see non-villainous, soft role. Again kudos well-written scenes. The transformation city based, hip, largely insensitive youngsters working towards cause happens gradually ungrudgingly. However, all's well far writing concerned too. Uvika's Alekh's roles underwritten lack depth initial exposition. Their motivations clear that, I got feel maybe movie could've done without them. Also movie could saved precious 20 odd minutes keeping absolutely dispensable songs - terms music itself, way picturised. I could also make observations things like Sikandar's cringed nose squinted eyes. But, I would lose focus movie trying aim at. One would absolutely right say none departments film-making seem delved 100% - writing, acting, technical aspects like camerawork editing. But, full marks attempting describe complex issues involved farmer suicides. Yes, whole load sub-plots, one shows different link chain events leads ultimate breakdown farmer grows us daily rice dal (lentil curry). At many points movie, I wondering movie targeted towards multiplex audience issues trying resolve situated land far, far away. And THE point. It aimed towards you, browsing net looking reviews latest release. It sensitize us what's happening rather there, interiors country. It doesn't offer earth-shattering, practical solutions. In fact alludes fact intelligent people here. Why don't something? What? How? When? That's us figure out. They given us why. Maybe one solutions us rural training part education - medical students? Engineers, managers, accountants, artists contribute too. Is farfetched? It's impossible reach sensitivity, it? Of course, going hardly going easy. The righteous us wronged, unsympathetic also made human. I thrilled. Thrilled new things tried Hindi cinema. Be it, narrative style Aamir abstract use metaphor No Smoking theme moviemakers wouldn't dare touch yardstick like Summer 2007. All commercial doom written them. And way made, I'm sure even paper, people involved knew well it's going make moolah. But, urge tell story brings stories us. Of course, I would even thrilled Aamir Summer 2007 well box office. But I'm glad unlikelihood financial success didn't keep movies made. And least Summer 2007 serves documentation things India '00s reacted them.
