If watch Kochadaiiyaan, actual film, you'll see snippets film made - cast wear special suits meant performance capture, nothing react terms environment surroundings. It reminds tough filmmaking is. It also inspires awe actors like Superstar Rajnikanth, willing embrace new technology go distance order narrate story believe in. Unfortunately, 'making-of' segments also things truly worth watching Kochadaiiyaan. The culprit, surprisingly, quality animation visual effects. Stilted human figures, lifeless textures environment, unrealistic camera movements, many more; Kochadaiiyaan thorough visual disappointment. Of course, comparing film likes big Hollywood summer blockbuster must know entire budget Kochadaiiyaan would fraction much would cost get Hugh Jackman X-Men: Days Future Past. Still, doesn't ease disappointment. A pity, really, story, though truly ordinary, enough meat make fun watch. Two warring kingdoms battling ghosts past threats future, one hero straddles burdens history, loss, deception love. It makings bit minor epic, honest. Unfortunately, apart visual let-down, film also suffers mediocre music A. R. Rahman, rather placid screenplay. The twists never really grab you, always wait least glimpse Thalaivar - real one - makes believe impossible; never happens. He flourish two there, also gets rattle dialogues (including self-referencing I suspect, watch film Tamil) always miss him. Fact is, there's one flesh blood, amount technology change that. Of course, many shots film couldn't executed live-action - Rajnikanth's entry, instance. Alas! Soundarya Rajnikanth Ashwin must surely lauded brave attempt, Kochadaiiyaan deserved either good best performance-capture animated film ever, deserved made all. This technically shoddy film come attempt justice neither Thalaivar fans. And they've made gorgeous Deepika Padukone's face added travesty. That sad truth it.
