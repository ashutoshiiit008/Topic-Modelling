How ironic. A movie makes comment prevalent systems Hindi film industry gives us complete dose slapstick, clich√©s, glaring loopholes, songs don't belong works. And despite making smart snide remarks. It talks indirectly audience's taste films dictated star day. About non-actor reign "Bollywood". It talks way things work industry. That takes lot struggle make big. That goodness ingenuity necessarily awarded. But unbelievable events like entire population rundown building lends miraculous support protagonist. Or lead lady who's successful actress say decisions regarding personal life. Are formula sub-plots comment commercial cinema gaps script - we'll never know. Or "bollywood" excuse making one patchy film? And despite flaws interesting plot twists film. The kind put characters dilemmas conflicts require extreme steps resolved. Shekhar (Akshaye Khanna) reaches point decision pretty much control forced upon him. When he's ready. A decision pretty much makes 'love life' vs. 'his career'. Manasi (Amrita Rao) faces two extreme types people life. People want take every advantage affluent position people can't bare thought that. She good girl yet makes extremely selfish move. All facets film industry might also reflect community touched upon. From naturally malicious converted cruel people. And well-meaning people try play mentor first take care themselves. Such life. And Short Kut captures well. The lead actors decent job portraying characters too. Akshaye Khanna comes across righteous egoistic, male chauvinist Shekhar is. So far I've seen Amrita Rao play non-glam roles. Seeing skimpy clothes feels like seeing child grow woman. Two old men lech offended me. But came across someone take care herself. Exactly like Manasi. Arshad Warsi exact amount annoying portrayal shallow, uncouth b@$!@&*. I could easily done without parts gets loud tolerable. Which reminds unique sense humor one needs see Chunkey Pandey cast acting Guru! The rest side characters best left alone. They garish caricatured funny. They fact make film seem much longer actually is. Also film drags quite bit. Had slapstick drama left would good riddance bad rubbish. And would saved lot stock, money, time makers audience. Imagine man-hours spent watching extra ugly frills. For best short cut would skip film. For others care interesting conflicts characters might want give shot. But forward button might come handy not-so-interesting parts come. They come bit often.
