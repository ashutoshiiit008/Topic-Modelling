First things first. Yes, I've read books Harry Potter. Fourth book onwards, first day. Does make Harry Potter fan. Yes (Well, I prefer call J.K. Rowling fan). But make fan movies based uber-popular books too? Sadly, no. I didn't like movie interpretations books. But watching pathetic interpretations Percy Jackson The Golden Compass, I think folks fine job Harry Potter. Still, I went watch one lowered expectations. And I wonderfully surprised. As soon censor certificate showed movie title it, everyone theater hooting, clapping kids making sorts happy noises. So set mood. And movie carried forward on. About movie: Harry, Ron Hermione set find destroy rest horcruxes defeat Lord Voldemort. On journey discover existence three deathly hallows, three powerful magical objects wizarding world. They also uncover, You-Know-Who hunting one become invincible. The movie doesn't show much action, lays ground much. Each character prepares inevitable war, come last movie, fingers-crossed, would awesome. The lead actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint ever-so-lovely Emma Watson) done job well. The supporting cast didn't much role one everyone shined brilliantly screen-time had. I personally huge-huge fan Helena Bonham Carter (who plays Bellatrix Lestrange movie) would loved see her. But hey, story already written can't play around much. However, try fit lighter moments film book, pulled them. A couple times, jokes seem forced though. Most movie shot shades gray (So you're watching big-screen you're going enjoy much). While I heard people complain darkness movie (They meant dark colors. Though Voldemo... whoops.... He-who-must-not-be-named oozes plenty darkness too), I loved it. Like movies like The Dark Night, Inception, Kill Bill, etc darker shades added eeriness movie took kids' film we-mean-serious-business one. The background score Alaxandre Desplat amazing. Cinematography visual treat. Screenplay Direction ten folds better two movies preceded one. And another surprise. The best thing movie Emma Watson (Not even making scene. Yes, one. You're already way theater aren't you?) Not that. It five minutes animated sequence told story origin three deathly hallows. Brilliant understatement it. It's brilliantly done I didn't want end. Verdict: You know you're going watch it. And wouldn't enjoy watching nearly much TV screen. So go, watch, enjoy one big screen. But hoping lots action, you'd disappointed.
