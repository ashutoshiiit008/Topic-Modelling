Wally Pfister – Christopher Nolan’s long time collaborator cinematographer – makes directorial debut Transcendence, first word comes mind describe first film gives us, ‘strange’. Transcendence instantly slots sci-fi space. But sci-fi element mostly relegated background. While one can’t say dumbed per se, exists like gentle fumes behind philosophical moral themes film talks – dangers fusing technology human thought, limits humanity go to, powers hands. It also human drama sorts. Except, nothing dramatic film. It doesn’t particularly graph journey characters – least usual cinematic sense arc. Then course, thriller. Yet again, though, thriller doesn’t thrill outright. It doesn’t peaks moments leap shock you. It makes sense foreboding – making wait something happen; something never really happens. It expects content journey, destination. Lastly, also strange sort romance – lead pair hardly ever spends screen time together, love share transcends everything we’ve come accept ‘normal’. This, I suspect, one reasons behind film’s title, though also another reason given film. Transcendence extraordinary researcher named Will Caster, cusp taking artificial intelligence uncharted realms. However, fringe group activists empowering machines much. The clash two streams thought eventually leads Caster something much bigger anyone ever hoped; Will wife Evelyn separated manner never even dreamed of. It interesting, manner Pfister treats film. An old school man, Pfister shoots film lovingly, film. The grainy look hardly ever betrays film actually high end, ultra radical technology – strange sort paradox. He hurry tell story, pace film never ever picks up. It unfolds slowly, ends. He uses extreme close ups, number abstract, slow film further. There times seems like effort actually alienate audience film, that, film succeeds quite often – Transcendence unlikely win many fans, because, crudely put, nothing much happens film. Nothing film outright impressive level – terms plot, treatment even technique. (One audience member even called film ‘boring’.) The audience can’t quite faulted here, one see Pfister intention impressing audience ever. Transcendence slow poison. Neither force audience think questions raises, try blow mind character Will Caster ends up. With unusually staid pace, end forgetting important moral implications power human intellect, film holds core. It core film, however, needs one take earnest initiative truly understand. The film, essentially, body. It does, however, soul. And souls, we’ve come believe, live forever. I suspect, then, sort film that, time, find audience. The audience today though, I’m sure, likely reject film.
