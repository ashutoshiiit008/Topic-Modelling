There pretensions making profound message movie please ages. It clearly meant kids ten doesn't lose focus. In fact, bank heavily upon supposedly limited movie watching experience children. This evident expected turn events - micro sub-sub-plots ultimate climax. Itâ€™s sweet understated instances keep wire live though. Fantasy tales fascinate immensely. We leave whole world open storyteller explore. He take us anywhere wishes obligation stick reality. It entirely use leverage liberally give him. Yet Jay (story writer) admirably tried best remain rooted ground. The side effect though basic plot pretty much unimaginative thus surprises. The restraint shows departments too. The camerawork appropriately doesn't take dizzying MTV land. Which also means editor behaving new toys called 'scissors' 'sticky tape'. Sorry guys, forgive me, I still overcome shock called Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. Visually, Chain Kulii Ki Main Kulii equals soothing boat ride calm lake Jhoom Barabar Jhoom equals rocky car ride potholed monsoon roads Pune (India). Okay - digression ends here. Rahul Bose usual calm composed self too. The kids behave like kids except one two times get philosophical reflective adults. Patently unnatural. And dialogues natural thus basically boring. The music actually infuriating. Especially "Sunday Sunday" blatant copy "Na bole tum na maine kuch kaha" Baton Baton Mein. However, I quite enjoy spoof cricket world created. They - mandatory Sardar (Sikh), left-handed captain star-batsman, Muslim pace bowler, number 10 T-shirt, coach experiments batting line-up, last least - chauvinistic dig female commentator "obviously" knows nothing game. So, plan action weekend - take kids theater stay looking form entertainment alternate loo fag breaks. And end all, together say, "What fun!?"
