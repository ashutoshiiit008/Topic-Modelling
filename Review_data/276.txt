What going villain always Plan B unless he's busy making believe Plan A failed? Hate guts? For sure, yes. Especially since cocky every line utters wise-crack. As afterthought, also admire writer's capacity throw twist-after-twist making sure know motivations behind characters' behaviors. But maybe over-estimated capacity interested turns. After while, gets tiring. The HUGE slip-up second-half blurring motivations make Don 2 average Hindi film. When choice scorned woman's wrath turning gullibility Don change heart - know writer copped out. No explanations good enough switching character traits took two films set-up, within heartbeat. In fact, I wanted laugh loud proceedings, brain hadn't finished bewildered I seen screen. Et tu, Farhan Akhtar? I suddenly flashback Dil Chahta Hai's "proposal wedding" scene. Gosh, turn-off was! Anyway, lot things going Don 2. Shah Rukh Khan certainly one them. He makes forget, watching Shah Rukh Khan. Either that, best use typical stutter laugh. Maybe spluttering chuckle reserved villainous roles avoided comic romantic. Not that, voice modulation works. His look - especially first half hour film goes completely character. And course, character that, almost actors one two things do, around - act toes don't trust him, visibly show despise him. Everyone Priyanka Chopra Boman Irani Nawab Shah decent job that. There slight variation form Om Puri dispassionate CBI officer Don another criminal Kunal Kapoor fresh self-assured. It's shame that, write decent characters; intelligence flair intertwining plots make work thriller; yet end making film nosedives mundane last 20-30 minutes. There also matter much time taken stylizing everything. In attempt add oomph many scenes director, Farhan Akhtar, over-estimates time audience take let twirl plot register. In turn, gives audience time figure what's going ends making scene predictable. And happens scene scene. Fortunately, scenes shot well. The film also collage beautiful shots around world. Some may even accuse travel company's brochure wants visit countries. But, also evidence Don's reach expanse power. The action sequences choreographed shot well too. But can't help feel much Farhan Akhtar do. It almost seems like testing waters one step time, "Hollywood this, let try. If clicks, next time, I'll experiment I really want do." Maybe, it's wishes taking over. Meanwhile, left spectacular camera stunt work, nothing haven't seen action films far. The thing left look forward then, smart aleck remarks Don going make leave people around retortless. That begins missing mark - makes filmy without memorable enough. Especially, since seen many promos. It's almost like dialogue writer Farhan Akhtar trying live father's name. Alas, overdoes process repeats father's lines way often. We know love lines dad wrote, Mr. Akhtar Jr. We love too. But now, begun kill us. For though, I'm going grudgingly appreciate loathsome lead character you've tried create. If hadn't let devil take human form.
