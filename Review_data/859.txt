Majid Majidi’s universe full do-gooders. It’s trust people money. No matter economically challenged are, you’re always kind share meal guest. Customers shop don’t whisk away extra-change may handed mistake. People extremely hospitable, welcoming innocent. Crime, murders unheard of. People tell lies, larger good. There human villians films. If any, enemy product circumstances - often intangible, something protagonist must overcome. That’s exactly context The Song Sparrows. Karim (Reza Naji) works ostrich farm outskirts Tehran, wants loan money boss, buy hearing aid daughter since one used wear stopped working fell dirty cesspool. Poor Karim faces uphill task generate money, gets fired job thanks moment carelessness leads ostrich escape farm. The Song Sparrows captures Karim’s loss innocence frequents city every day posing motorbike pilot ferries people heavy goods. Although earns well this, every piece city scrap begins accumulate backyard becomes symbol degradation generous good-hearted Karim known for. It’s fantastic message, told beautifully simple vignettes - Karim’s refusal part beautiful blue door wife donated neighbours, violent outrage spots children selling roses highway - become signs Karim acid tongued grime face accumulates driving around city day. Through Karim’s character, Majidi’s saying life city bad; he’s saying people change spend lot time urban setup. It’s universal truth, isn’t it? Something snaps inside Karim daily grind city. He loses something family friends treasured him. The film’s plot regains old self, pressure circumstances little help family. Visually, one Majidi’s arresting films - arresting, almost smell Irani soil. The first 15 minutes film pure eye candy lensman Tooraj Mansuri’s camera captures grace ostrich run aburdity chase, dry landscape. They lasting impressions film. The close-ups Karim’s face throughout course film important - discover Reza Naji good, tweak cheek muscles worth thousand emotions stirred inside him. Majidi’s films always hidden relationship water. It’s also case The Song Sparrows, except adds another regular films - goldfish. Part film’s official poster, scene involving transportation hundreds goldfish, moving sequences film, shot Majidi’s characteristic slow-motion. I found tears end it. I’ve seen almost Majidi’s internationally acclaimed films far - Children Heaven, The Colour Paradise, Pedar, Baran. This film latest addition. As got I settled mull film, I found asking one question: Does Majidi’s universe really exist? Are Persians genuinely good Majidi portrays be? Interestingly, I may sure answers questions, I’m least convinced one thing - always manage sympathise protagonists films. Perhaps that’s people world love films. Perhaps that’s they’re acclaimed critics audiences globally - feat sometimes difficult achieve. Perhaps that’s call Magic Majidi.
