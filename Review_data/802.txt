If graph enjoyment thorough 3.5+ hours movie, would bell-shaped curve. At first holding head forced attempts comedy drama. Then begin laughing silliness all. Slowly stories start growing know fond characters. Then comes interval. Things gradually slide intentional melodrama preachy “holier-than-thou” lines. And back holding head. This certainly kind movie allowed say things like, “Yeah right! Like happens real life”. If want logic, stay home. Treat movie one big cinematic liberty enjoyable. The movie weaves different stages couple goes get stay married. And smoothly, grace elegance. Since much ground cover pace keeps interested till time stories wrap up. Interestingly, unique route taken avoid confusion six stories could cause - don’t make six “complete” stories all! There two main stories, three side stories, comic-relief no-connection-to-main-story-story. Even interesting fact male characters full life partners. The songs whole, contribute positive experience. Sameer surprised us lyrics touching "Ya rabba". It heart-warming watch hear. “Dil kya kare” “Salaam-e-ishq” sweet - ears eyes. Two things strike use bagpipes sizeable screen time given Priyanka Chopra. The directorial spoof-touch given movie impressive. What spoof of? Everything ever associated phrase masala movie (or "Bollywood", must). Name - wet skimpily-clad seductress, falling car, temple bells, random people street clapping guy proposes girl, comic-relief sub-plot, mandatory airport scene characters suddenly get control staff, boy arriving girl’s wedding stop it… Oops! Didn’t mean scare you. Not worry, done great style. They actually characters hold video cameras shoot on-goings throughout first half - symbolically reminding movie. The “masala” gift wrapped tastefully bright paper. And bow top take-off leading director real-life celebrity couple. A love story supposed evoke emotions. Many love stories even more. But one six tear-jerker. Can't blame script. The stories appropriately fleshed out. Special mention needed Anil Kapoor-Juhi Chawla story. All performances absolutely great! Especially Akshaye Khanna Govinda's comic timing. It dialogues lacked impact. There good comedy lines (mostly given Akshaye Khanna), made heart go character. The basic question – worth spending 45 minutes end despair almost 2.5 hours good entertainment between? Yes, don’t need rush halls.
