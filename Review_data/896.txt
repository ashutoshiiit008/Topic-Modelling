Who would thought film starring Vinay Pathak, I'd complaining limited talent? But, happens fooled believing Vinay Pathak film. Tere Mere Phere almost 75% Rahul (Jagrat Desai) Pooja (Sasha Goradia) Jai played Vinay Pathak. And boy, Rahul Pooja annoy! It's cute see arguments home, big screen. You sort-of, kind-of identify characters. But issue Rahul Pooja bickering newly-wed couple. And rows reminded kind tiffs I brother, I 10 5! - That kind amateur writing talking about. It's little unsettling then, see sudden insight dialogue spouted unlikely character even subtle suggestion terms character does. For example, thing newly-wed wife wouldn't want husband exposed natural processes, things make human. Or like mom newly-wed son wants part life. But things like character childlike two scenes ago, suddenly gains wisdom. So, character aims perfect relationships, husband mother-in-law, time breaks glassware angry. I understand lovers' spats like that, fight make-up, quarrel try understand. But here, seemed pattern convenience writer. I mean, HUGE fight reasonably huge error part spouse, forgiven within minutes? Like said insights, dash humor shows surprise. Surprise laughs come interval even start, quips far apart. I liked relief form Rahul's family played Darshan Jariwala, actor plays younger son (?) even Sushmita Mukherjee, wouldn't watch entire film couple squabbling that. Other though, it's mostly screeching shouting. I astounded woman director would portray ALL three women characters high-pitched, bossy-pushy women. And it's like involved writing, Deepa Sahi co-writer. And yet, would unfair judge Deepa Sahi's directorial capabilities based Tere Mere Phere. A huge part film comes across shoddy product budget constraints. I'm assuming, better budget, would better actors. And different actors, one film could different. And course, least 20-25 minutes edited out. I push lot blame actors understand "look" film suffers hands low budget. But, things quite control actor. For example, Sasha Goradia's dubbing like English film dubbed Hindi. Very distracting, irritating. Especially laughs screeches - lot. And yet, film complete loss. That's relatable subject, little humor, little hope watching Vinay Pathak. Basically, something stop bit skipping channels.
