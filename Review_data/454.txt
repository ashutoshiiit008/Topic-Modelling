Love stories characters belonging rival families something intrinsically tragic them. Sometimes pathos overwhelming enough make ignore everything else that's wrong story. At times though, could Ishaqzaade isn't sure wants audience react characters thus comes across confused. Add stretched out, predictable climax uneasy, restless audience. The first scene introduces Parmar (Arjun Kapoor) ruthless, uncouth brat audience unwillingly call anti-hero, let alone hero. And no, right end, cannot warm character; empathizing rooting cause distant thought. But also says two things complimentary content - Parmar nothing character consistent; Arjun Kapoor plays Parmar perfection feeling disgust towards character never leaves you. Exactly things said Zoya Parineeti Chopra actor plays Zoya. Zoya consistently immature ironically feminine far emotion goes, behind macho bravado. In fact, Zoya likable despite inconsistency life thrill ride death equally adventurous too. This charm seeps lot Parineeti Chopra's refreshing attitude towards lead lady Hindi film. Unfortunate is, none translates story sustain interest two hours. Ishaqzaade reminded "predicable" doesn't mean audience guessing exactly happen. A story predicable tad frustratingly so, audience guesses two (or more) possible outcomes particular situation (or all) seem equally done death. You could style good camera work sense aesthetics lack content transparent. The dialogues lack charm Habib Faisal's debut Do Dooni Chaar. The references - woman's place Indian society, strong-headed girl righteous widow, similar impotence man whatever takes seeks approval role model - interesting little lame plot culminates. Social message end, notwithstanding. A love story love story love story. And actually, expect little it, terms different. What want engage Romeos Juliets, want feel Majnu unite Laila, world beyond. But Ishaqzaade, aren't even sure Ranjha deserves Heer. Amidst endless gun shots, hoping gun two go cliche run bullets, sight 'The End'.
