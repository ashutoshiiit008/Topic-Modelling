The "revenge futile" concept new next "boy meets girl" plot. Moreso, it's set Mumbai slum. But combination "ganglord wants mend ways" enough meat make film treated finesse. Allah Ke Bande starts way there, gets lost trying stylize dramatize. A couple interesting plot points lose writer/director don't know focus. The writing also suffers usual pace issues. One half slow, half desperately trying catch up. I understand set-up necessary us feel characters, didnâ€™t matter. The second half could well different film. None characters introduced first half anything post-interval (yeah-yeah, except protagonists!) Sharman Joshi cool, calculative planner, Vijay Faruk Kabir impulsive executor, Yakub. Though times Yakub doesn't follow plans Vijay execution. But there's serious, unfathomable deviation initial set-up. Sharman good mix tense, disappointed, rebellious, romantic. Faruk hand repulsive. This intentional likelihood, gets overbearing boring see screen. Oh yeah, boys play young Vijay Yakub didn't work one bit. Their fuming seems superficial wigs serve unpleasant distraction. And despite two exactly need characters, fail engage you. How possible privy plans? If I see execution, I end saying "a shootout shootout shootout" "a chase chase chase." What's point I don't care whether chaser caught killed shootout? There soft moments couple thought-provoking dilemmas. Mostly evoked Atul Kulkarni's character, masterji (the school teacher). That's situation, performance. This role nothing close man capable of. The moments allowed Anjana Sukhani's character, Sandhya. Sure, another case woman used prop, Sandhya shades Parveen Babi's Anita Deewar. There many smaller characters, none stick except Naseeruddin Shah's performance warden. He impact nerves he's screen seen whole film, role looks like one brutal scene jail. Allah Ke Bande's attempt showing inhuman conditions prevalent "homes". It tries show much harm homes instead teaching children better way living. It doesn't want take risk keeps getting dark. A movie crime usually little new say. Allah Ke Bande tries real hard. You can't say succeeded, seeing difficulties protagonists go through, feel, get easy. Are many movies subject desensitizing us?
