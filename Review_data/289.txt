After long long while, watching bad movie make grit teeth anger. It made laugh despair. Kudos 17 year-olds sitting beside saying lines actors clich√©d scenes, obviously giggling victory serious spots. Only dialogues blamed identify situation characters. Especially since performances half bad. The sick PJs (poor jokes) - yeah that's sick poor - try best make eyes roll. But going give satisfaction, we? Jimmy Sheirgill looked awesome whatever justice done aweful lines given him. You actually feel bad actor Jimmy character. While Neha Dhupia certainly slimmest stick around, certain Rubenesque appeal. Her costumes outright gorgeous, especially saris, carried well too. Her performance obviously best lady's skills improving gradually. It's good enough individual alright performances. A couple chemistry. Now, screen chemistry abstract term. But I think described failure understand tension husband wife don't feel tense. You see trying romantic doesn't strike chord. Again I think actors cannot held entirely responsible here. I think camera decisions. In shots couple, twosome matter, camera speaker. The listener seldom frame. It almost like person's lines shot separately. Yet again, Om Puri wasted inconsequential loud role Kamini Khanna shrill. Speaking which, felt like side characters conversing highest possible pitch. The transition one story another jerky clumsy. Not mention side stories could completely avoided since never meant given adequate footage. Also, ain't best time show man - Tendulkar hitting fours sixes. I don't blame makers since I assume finished filming long World cup debacle. Or maybe right time remind us glorious past. Oh, I go again... The mediocre presentation songs makes forget actually worth listening to. The "rang barse" (from Silsila) type holi song doesn't work jealousy background. The college kids' need learn lip-synching. The situations created almost every song fit lyrics. Its supposed way around. "Tere bin" certainly best lot though made lot sense sub-titles. The silver lining mercury close 40 degrees cinema hall functioning air-conditioners. I sorry - silver lining movie pretentious all. It marketed "a feel good movie", know everything sort even buy ticket. As little bonus, I don't spend energy trying hard give story away. About dialogue-writers-in-their-own-right-giggly-teens - first-day-first-show, like seeing second time. Besides, would want to? Unless go ogle Jimmy Neha.
