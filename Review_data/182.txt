It's hard fun watching film like Captain America: The Winter Soldier gigantic IMAX screen, virtually transports middle action. With plot attempts relevant - current scenario worldwide electronic espionage - neat little cast welcome additions previous film, keeps entertained most. Yet, ponder it, despite clear attempts stand out, sequel really different slew superhero reboots sequels regular summer feature, now. Same old, old. In Chris Evans' first turn First Avenger, served relatively silent film - film set character well, genuine attempt World War II period feel it; least much big superhero film could muster. The sequel set current day, bigger, grander louder. Captain America, settling quantum leap world taken since last remembered it, sucked conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. itself, one global security ramifications. Meanwhile, also mysterious villain, known Winter Soldier, tied intricately Captain America's past. With staple dose humour, tons action, lot talk along way, film pretends bit heavyweight terms plot, comes across tad superficial, eventually. While twists predictable, action shot far better last film, unsteady look obviously gives edgier feel. The 3D, however, doesn't particularly add much film. With Scarlett Johansson's Natasha (or Black Widow) Marvel's latest big screen debutante Falcon (played quite well Anthony Mackie) company time round, there's whole lot forgettable fun lasts. Another addition cast, lends film much credibility eventually commands, Robert Redford plays enigmatic Alexander Pierce. Samuel L. Jackson - seems quite fun appearances Nick Fury, Director, S.H.I.E.L.D. - gets longish role well, one best moments film briefest hat tips Jules Winnfield Pulp Fiction. But that's probably Tarantino fanboy speaking. Directors Anthony Joe Russo, known far smaller films, usually lighter vein, take biggest film date, decent job it. Though lacks truly jaw-dropping set pieces, frames scale grand enough, actually quite imaginative execution; one car chase sequence exhilarating, film extended action climax we've come expect. The biggest problem film, me, lack justice eponymous villain, Winter Soldier. His appearances sporadic, presence never fully explained, history Captain America never given enough meat. There simply reason name included title film, plot film virtually nothing him. He relegated side attraction, best. Expectedly, end credits scene - directed Joss Whedon - teases little, introduction couple Marvel villains poised add spice future. In fact, it's time admit standalone Avengers films fast becoming like teasing nuggets Avengers: Age Ultron. That, really, big prize we're waiting for, lieu time give films along way.
