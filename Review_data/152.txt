Darren Aronofsky, director films like Pi, Requiem For A Dream, The Wrestler achieved almost perfect film Black Swan. The flaws, even any, seem obvious attempts find any, equivalent finding needle haystack. Based character ballerina Nina, quest perfection, soon begins lose mind trying play coveted central roles ballet, film gripping psychological thriller, start finish. In process, director visits human body’s fragility yet again, previous films (Requiem For A Dream dealt body succumbing drug abuse, The Wrestler dealt fighter’s body). Aronofsky gives life unforgettable character Nina, played devoted Natalie Portman, role actress’ contemporaries would kill for. Aronofsky begins film much like docu-drama, camera following Nina’s character closely - style polished previous films. I still can’t stop marvelling little time took establish Nina’s character, shed tear two selection ballet, cringe every time peeled dead skin fingers toes, nurse wound cracked toenails. Graphic, disturbing gory. After you’ve wowed Nina’s condition director’s setup, supporting cast takes - Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina’s sensuous, carefree nemesis; Thomas (Vincent Cassell) promiscuous instructor Nina’s mother (Barbara Hershey), former ballerina herself. The film largely centres around Nina Lily - one charming graceful, other, qualms letting go losing herself. Ironically, qualities Nina required portray opera performance, challenge becomes obsessed perfecting. Portman’s year long training dedication towards role, totally Oscar-worthy I’m glad it’s least one choice unanimous. Jealousy, competition, regret, pushing limits, fantasy - major threads screenplay weaves in. But biggest thread obsession. I’ve seen people obsessed looks, Blackberry phones handbags, artist’s obsession perfection something else, something work towards, laboriously. Especially, role challenging, required transition good guy bad guy, flawlessly. Portman’s premise entirely believable, sympathetic tragic. And happening, two parallel stories - Nina Swan Lake - seem switch sides. In quest perfect character Black Swan, Nina increasingly finds internalising creature, thanks relationship Lily. She becomes like ugly duckling, rebellious bold meanwhile, character Swan Lake longs become like Nina’s earlier self, White Swan - pure, attractive controlled. Redemption happens, side expect. What makes transition fluid, consistently well-choreographed hand-held photography Mathew Libatique. I used word ‘choreographed’ I realised camera movement opera, graceful tiptoe every ballerina performing. That, accompanied Clint Mansell’s original background score, elevate film new highs. The climax through-and-through goosebump-cum-wow sequence, riddled twists surprises. You’re left guessing, next comes end, murmur, “Oh God.” I did, I stuck, sinking film even over. To borrow phrase Navjyot Sidhu, Black Swan hit like tracer bullet. There good films bad films. And films league own, surpassing expectations medium. Darren Aronofsky made one film.
