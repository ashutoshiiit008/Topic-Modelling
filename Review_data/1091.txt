Educative, entertaining to-the-point. Compare film is, likelihood made entertain. Its target audience obviously kids 12. And moralize. Okay, mercifully parents lecturing children, it's way around. And how? Not one two adults amongst entire cast supporting cast 50+ care environment. And all, note ALL kids lay lives save planet. If one-dimensionality across characters enough, many sub-plots left without closure - making wonder first place. Not wanted scenes huge sermon least kind arc story would helped.

All child artists behave like kids practicing lives' first skit school - conscious yet self-important. The kids aren't given cute stuff either. The kind would make smile least keep engaged, meanwhile. There number references spoofs popular Hindi films, I doubt many children would get references might seen original. And way amateur dull adults enjoy. Also happenings anywhere close reality. For example, kids parents watch them, look least while, comes forth last sequence. The climax though interesting satire underlying truth late redeem part film. This one kids might watch forget soon-soon.
