It literally 10 avtars Lord Vishnu according Hindu mythology. Good aim educate kids mythology without reading books presenting interpretation religion them. This description God greatness pretty skewed according me. I'm Hindu too, I doubt God ego-centric won't grant wishes I don't pray him. Closing eyes regurgitating lines Sanskrit I don't understand never gone well me. So, Ajay little sister sort-of anchors link 10 avatars told say "mantra" get another place, I cringe. And wonder, I really want kids faith without understanding? That besides though, aim get kids acquainted subject, Dashatar might good start. Of course, 10 stories told 110 minutes, expectations details minimal. Especially longer tales Rama Krishna. However, everything accurate whatever tales I've heard since childhood. Not I researched topic depth, I always seen Ravana ten heads, never seven. Also, I always thought Ravana competitor Sita's swayamwar (the practice girl chooses husband list suitors). Then surprised see Sita actually beautiful. And Buddha avatar completely omitted? Blunders movie aimed educating young, ask me. But, again, tried keep light including songs. And don't miss bollywoodification Gods demons Kurma (Turtle) avatar. It hilarious! Might even offend people. There's nothing much I say low budget animation fact obviously low budget. And low creativity too. I don't understand all, Narada, Vishnu, Brahma look same. Similarly, Sita Laxmi look too. Yet, see glimpses good use colors couple songs, "Ram Ram Sri Ram" "Tim tim tim tim tare". So, I would much rather read Tinkle subject kids. But, would mainly ideological differences way God portrayed. Otherwise, barring glaring flaws pointed like ones above, movie might good way introduce mythology little ones.
