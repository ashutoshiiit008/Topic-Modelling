Last year, saw Jaegers Kaiju battle big screen giant supremacy, Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim. While know fun war panned out, perhaps wouldn’t wrong say Godzilla still remains grand-daddy big screen mega-creatures. Six decades Godzilla’s first big screen appearance, maverick director Gareth Edwards gives us fun retelling Godzilla legend; film far fun last Hollywood Godzilla film, 1998 one directed Roland Emmerich. What makes fun fact film also strange sort superhero film; yes, read right. Watch one right first frame, cleverly designed opening credits lay groundwork story film, launch real thing. Unexplained earthquakes, devastated nuclear plant; things get mysterious American engineer Japan begins fearing something far dangerous cause it. 15 years later, world gets see cause tremors was... Set initially Japan moving San Francisco finale, film takes time build, one best things film monsters aren’t overused. They make appearance late, never properly revealed audience right film. While automatically conveys sense massive scale, also makes appearance every monster event, making film almost always interesting, don’t quite know gigantic bit action going take place next. But I truly loved Godzilla reboot much draws ‘monster master’ Ishirô Honda’s 1954 film. (Remember, dedication last frame end credits Pacific Rim?) When Godzilla made first appearance 1954 essentially metaphor horrors Japan faced first victims nuclear bomb. Godzilla stood ills nuclear power, thought carried forward film, right connection Japan. Godzilla’s iconic wail hulking shape look better ever before, almost cheer every appearance his. The film beautifully shot - atmospheric moody. However, would ideally enjoyed best 2D, 3D doesn’t add much, glasses obviously make dark images even darker. What’s also nice film isn’t merely monsters booms. There’s story characters personal stake well. In fact, lot time actually spent making us invest characters, aren’t rooting nameless faceless crowds people. It unfolds leisurely pace initially, doesn’t bother all, crisp runtime. In fact, adds nicely sense tension, you’re waiting epic battles film ultimately about. Strangely enough, film, feel far personal connect Godzilla you’ve ever felt. And Godzilla reminds you, again, heroes come shapes sizes.
