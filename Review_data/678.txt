What moment irrationality make do? What unspeakable, unthinkable brutality human capable of, survival risk? How much evil irrationality get love, fear anger? Not Love Story dramatized version story involves murder. What makes murder special? It committed seasoned criminal, neither wannabe one. Regular people, people see friends with, commit murder worse, manage effects rather cold-bloodedly. And yet, execution film doesn't make feel newspaper item. I read news item, shook head dismay, I turned page. Nevertheless, I watching film, I involved interested Robin (Deepak Dobriyal) Anusha (Mahie Gill) go situation led murder. Even though, trailers, gave away core story. I moved Anusha giggles pretentiously faces disappointment disappointment landing role film. I unsure actions unsure motivations handle love life. I shocked afraid her. I could see Robin's love Anusha possessiveness. I saw cared protected seeing gore. But, outstanding performances. Somehow, once, I cannot make give even part credit actors' job director. One, person makes awful camera sound/music decisions anything performances? And two, I'm convinced director time direct actors since busy visual aural quirks. In fact, I must give pat back letting gimmicks distracting content film. Okay, I'm sure might least scene two bottom-up angle camera held upside shifty jerky moves made might worked towards scene's impact. But, past experiences RGV films make walk new film intention ignoring trials, thus I set block all. Oh, loud background score - I doubt worked even single scene. I don't understand use horror music thriller. This also added bothering throughout film even though story, like stories coming life, interesting acting ace-class. The intention film fill disgust towards person like capable of, music camera wanted get scared. Moreover, voyeurism takes us Mahie Gills short-skirt hems, in-the-face B-grade-film-style skin-show make roll eyes rather bringing character trying build. All took away intent much potential draw closer. Also, second half, interesting court drama brewing three versions event came forefront. But little time game play out, would mean film longer. And one thing film got right, length. So, I'll happy way court scenes turned out. In one scenes, horrified disbelief faces Anusha's friends find happened - said, "really? No! That couldn't be." Would believe one acquaintances, let alone friends confessed murder? That I think crux Not Love Story. Whatever I derived film despite RGV, failure.
