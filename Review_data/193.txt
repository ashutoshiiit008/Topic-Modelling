If even simply commuted work using public transport, know pesky co-traveller. You don't even need trip longer just-a-commute know one. And imagine anal retentive, almost obsessive compulsive intrusive co-traveller also unhygienic loud. And imagine you, third traveller watching one annoy other. Damn funny, right? And not? When aren't one suffering. And that’s exactly happens Challo Dilli. Unfortunately, goes overboard situations second half. You smile pasted every bit first half film. And see writer's desperation make story little regular road trip. You see suddenly take plunge crime & politics. Maybe attempt picking pace bit post-interval, didn't work me. Maybe I settled lazy, pleasant stroll film set-up. The shift quantity quality events thereafter came jolt. The subtle hints Mumbai vs. Delhi attitude, city vs. small-town mentality, upper middle class vs. lower middle-class divide transform on-the-face comments society live socio-politics take over. But Vinay Pathak all-so refreshing performance, everything looks tolerable. That Lara Dutta wasn't acting brains added bonus. They nice witty, everyday language going too. The well-executed camera work engaging background music made experience even better. Usually, departments draw attention, gets registered head negatively. But add lot two hours spent film. Go along, third person watching fun funny, quirky journey, even it’s DVD watch.
