Phas Gaye Re Obama absolutely delivers sarcastic wit title implies. Satire runs every dialogue situation film. Unfortunately though, alongside smart quips also oh-so-unnecessary slapstick. What could classy comedy becomes yet another toilet-humor fest. It brilliant, however, despite going crude route every while, story doesn't shift focus basic plot. A slapstic comedy focus - isn't relief. In fact, point latter half I'm wondering Shastri (Rajat Kapoor) going get this? I love writer director makes think behalf. He hooked, irrespective whether I'm enjoying film. Of course, film like wouldn't achieve half aims actors aren't capable getting timing right. Here, Sanjay Mishra, actor plays Anni (Manu Rishi?) brilliant. Who would've thought movie would stand tall shoulders? That too, Rajat Kapoor Neha Dhupia around, terms "star-value". Both forced dialogue delivery Neha Dhupia's character stylized. Also, feminism character portrays tasteless. Yet, person enjoys slapstick certainly going enjoy Phas Gaye Re Obama much I did. So, light, Sunday afternoon watch is.
