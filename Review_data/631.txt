Like melodrama drama, Mission Istanbul pointless style. What super-dangerous mega-powerful villains walking like ramp, waiting hero get start fist fight. So minutes ago, thousands guns gunmen disposal? Initially feel like hope story writer, plot seemed non-standard. But ultimately, it's another power-maniac villain thinks best gain maintain power. The characters like typical action movie - stereotypical hero, partner bimbette. So, ingredients form wannabe smart-Alec, pseudo geek cleavage. Okay, I'm exaggerating bit cleavage, need rush theater yet, boys! You know there's hope dialogue writer two characters introduce imitating James Bond. I can't even say it's downhill there, that's pretty much bottom hill. It annoys end, really sharp villain knows everything else can't spot super-suave hero - broad daylight! This coincidences start getting I almost checked whether ticket stub said Kismat Konnection! When show ace journalist (Zayed Khan) computer geek around, take cake. By way, top-notch journalist loves danger clue bugged technically savvy villain. Fine, accept 'top-notch' bit writer's imagination. But, hasn't guy seen single Hollywood action flick? Grrrrr Speaking stereotypes, another huge one shoved throat, time referring entire country. Is really appropriate show Afghanistan arms' market looks like vegetable market nook corner India? She's already country distress; need show worse is? And indeed dangerous place tourists arms' market!? Aah...these markets actually tourist attractions! Got it!! Seriously people, journalists would kind protection/back-up plan entering place. Also, I didn't think cinematographer combination editor justice either Afghanistan Turkey. The tourist spots covered rather hurriedly. I understand, travelogue, beauty/ruggedness places taken away eyes even registered. And I know places qualities movies covered better. If camera focused recording places deserve instead accommodating style. Isn't high time stop using slow motion imply 'style'? But, 'laugh loud' value Zayed Khan understands seriousness mission hand. He says, "he'll need equipment" Vivek Oberoi pull sunglasses put ... slo-mo!! Interestingly enough, attempt beginning keep continuity movie quintessential songs say one-liner like, "Work done, let's party" (though work didn't look like done me, anyway...). Later gave inhibitions threw song. And yet gall dialogue, "There's time love song!" The cinematic liberty placing songs randomly, 1000 coincidences takes make movie, unreal characters go show seriously take "All characters film fictitious, resemblance person dead alive coincidence" warning.
