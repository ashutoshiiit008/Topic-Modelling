You see Boman Irani horrendous get-up know next two hours aren't going bright. But again, ardent movie buff, right? No wonder reading review Hindi film called Fruit Nut or, like case, threshold theater playing it. Thus sliver hope, faith Boman Irani Diya Mirza's choice scripts. HA HA! You made nut case that's laugh related film. It can't bad, think? Bald wigged villain kidnaps beautiful damsel wants map gutter underneath state assembly building Mumbai. Co-villain(?) joins mid-way achieve purpose, except everyone changes aims objectives conveniently. Some actually serving purpose protecting heritage big bad mall-ification city. Except interested teeny-weeny bit. It madcap storyline slapstick lovers relish. The point, say, chaos aim make impossible possible - believable another story. You want madcap? You got MADCAP!! By ton more. Everything, every single micro-element film filled nonsense. Each character caricatured caricature. Each movement screen attempt make audience laugh character others' misfortune. Which translates 'Oh, funny'. And quintessential loudness genre adds pandemonium. There seems satirical comment trends urban life also spoofing Hindi slapstick films. Only explain average absurdity disconnect dialogues. Especially lines given Khandar (Mahesh Manjrekar). A lot pun used none connection anything. Anyway hindsight, feels like farfetched theory trying best find meaning chaos. Anyway, though I understand kind humor, I doubt anything genre-buffs either. When 100 minutes get bit much stay put seat, know gone wrong.
