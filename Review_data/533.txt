Parents use movie substitute story-teller. The kids might mind, adults though certainly going enjoy show! This great story whole lot sub-plots. It really sad explored full potential. The movie starts titles look like PowerPoint presentation. It looks like decided 50% screen time devoted Krishna's birth Kansa's death, rest used fit many stories related Krishna possible. The pace simply drags Kansa's end gets closer. The screenplay patchy transition sub-story sub-story smooth. The animation outright bad! Budget constraints cannot used excuse equal-sized, blunt fingers sharp, angular shoulders characters. Once see first five minutes movie passed by, let go expectation might seeing three expressions faces - sad, happy angry. Colours used fullest, especially background undoubtedly ample scope colour story! One thing stand though, ripples water surface, done really well. It clear one directed towards children right disclaimer beginning. Then music geared towards them? The songs drab song used credits looks place though made kids kids. The background score good though, especially way chorus breaks "Krishnaâ€¦" time Krishna slays demon. The reason give middle rating good way introduce narrate details Krishna's fables children. It certainly worth showing kids hope established standards animation yet.
