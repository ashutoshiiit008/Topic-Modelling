What say film can't shake feeling vehicle mother (Hema Malinito re-launch daughter (Esha Deol), like father (Dharmendra) keeps sons (Bobby Deol Sunny Deol). Watch closing song Esha Tanya, character plays! I doubt even Salman Khan's item appearance trick though. Someone needs tell family, working. They move side-character roles soon, going stick acting is. They don't look good, don't emote well. Anyway so, say film can't shake feeling Tanya looking biological parents go different exotic locations boyfriend friend boy? It tells lot constantly aware biological relationships crew film watching it. Tell Me O Khuda fails engage, fails make identify characters, fails keep interested duration film. The good thing said film protagonist sets interesting journey. But narrations lackluster, even though turns activist psychologist way, don't feel like laughing it. And one good thing, I cannot ask watch film even playing TV, skimming channels may stop bit. But, that's it.
