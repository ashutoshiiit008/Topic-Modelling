Does motivation murder justify murder? Does time elapsed justify forgiving crime? Is revenge futile? Does become justified first wrong done? Is cold-blooded crime less justifiable one committed heat moment? Does justification depend justification criminal? Is forgiveness less palatable done criminal? You might answers questions, ambiguity remain. They are, all, “yours”. Your “justifiable” different mine. The point is, Badlapur makes think you've drawn line. Even entirely convincing. In sense, Badlapur pushes boundaries regular Hindi thriller film. We know going go one way – wronged going either take revenge not. Badlapur makes reconsider much conscience allow even judge's seat. But, involves leap faith side. We make allowances films begin like watching ones want like. But often, story jerks way don't quite get. Badlapur character transformations. Sure, unpredictable unexpected seldom unexciting. But unpredictable change towards something built hour screen time doesn't convince you. For one passage time deal-breakers. Especially, short scene explains asking characters audience introspect. As film, story, Badlapur makes think convenient contrivance. As concept though film stays intensity violence. If take happens given find mulling circular thoughts. And Badlapur's success. You film 2+ hours theater. The actors stay long after. Nawazuddin Siddiqui makes laugh darkest moments go noir tone film. The character actor compliment perfectly, said every character man plays. So used class act we, one thing I'll remember Badlapur Varun Dhawan's performance. It might cakewalk good actor play brooder/sulker. But, Varun Dhawan carries drawin sympathy audience. You almost feel like telling let go anger sake. Huma Qureshi plays aloof concerned exactly like character would place. All others bit roles Vinay Pathak Radhika Apte Ashwini Kalsekar Divya Dutta keep film rooted. Their expressions body language make believe character feels. But might might convinced character feels first place. I slightly ambivalent pace film too. Not slow build-up issue, I can't help think dynamics would changed film lingered little less stayed crisp one come accept thriller. Starting philosophy "The axe forgets. The tree remembers.", Badlapur obviously aims psychological thriller. Unfortunately, neither whole-heartedly psychological thriller. Even though makes introspect attitude towards crime justice.
