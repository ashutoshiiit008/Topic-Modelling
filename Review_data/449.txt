Update: I watched film IMAX thought I share experience. * * * Chris Nolan shot scenes The Dark Knight nearly 45 minutes The Dark Knight Rises IMAX format. In Interstellar, went step further, substantial chunk movie shot large film format Nolan fond of. There's reason - true IMAX, incredible screen size, great sound film projection system (not digital like IMAX screens cities India), easily immersive film viewing format currently. Some shots Interstellar, particular space exploration parts, look absolutely stunning IMAX. To experience one humbling. Then again, large format, seems flaws film get equally amplified. Still, IMAX definitely format watch film in, even though small percentage us actually access it. * * * Humankind may evolved greedy, complex species devouring planet, vestiges once-inexhaustable thirst knowledge set us apart co-inhabitants earth. Yet, perhaps single greatest gift we've received - curiousity, urge know, tendency seek answer every question come across. We're travellers explorers. Our journeys may literal figurative, (the quest solve Fermat's Last Theorem, instance, also journey,) inherent goal always one - go depths unknown. That's truly excited human race, routines mundane, decadent lifestyles see today. Christopher Nolan's Interstellaris journey. Not take us unfathomable ride along protagonist Cooper, also makes us journey inwards, seek don't yet know ourselves. Yes, crash course physics would go long way making film easier follow, emotions heart film primal. They may may find way spot heart make resonate you, that's besides point. The question, ultimately, Nolan's intent. Interstellaris far richer emotions Nolan's previous work - much emotional core one cornerstones film. How much emotions touch big measure much you're willing move past vagaries ostensible foibles film - appear many. Set distant future, Earth seems incapable viable home humanity much longer, NASA recruits former astronaut lead mission space, find alternate home ensure continued survival species. The problems space time - biggest hurdles accessing outer reaches universe - solved curious wormhole. Nolan doesn't thrust science upon us right away. We begin observing state world, eyes Cooper family. We see relationship children - particularly daughter. Nolan, like filmmakers, uses characters voice thoughts often, it's interesting see Cooper encourage children also question analyze. The space travel exploration aspects, though obviously forming bulk film, begin much later. It knowledge physics film references would immense use following events occur. Relativity, wormholes, black holes, gravity, works - alien incomprehensible, film plodding, indulgent mystery. The deeper understanding physics question, gripping film becomes. Through all, overarching presence love never leaves. Love, seems, transcends space time, almost holding cosmos together. Nolan isn't particularly adept filming drama, film's weakest moments characters stop talk love express it. The scenes earnest, tad bit awkward. The film's jaw-dropping moments bang midst space exploration, Hoyte van Hoytema's magnificent frames spectacle behold. Chris Nolan's well-known trope - penchant non-linear narrative - forms backbone film. Except, time he's playing dimensions higher earthly presences bound, likely usual amount confusion exactly happened when. The film warrants repeat viewings, quite like every film filmography. Hans Zimmer always seems set aside something special Chris Nolan, time different. The music score Interstellaris hypnotic masterwork - lacks variation, makes sheer ambition. In fact, sound design film overall plays huge role gnawing attention. The use silence space, particularly face rapturous visual grandeur display, humbling. The film's biggest weakness runtime. At nearly 3 hours, test patience switch melodrama science. However, don't problem either, every minute film treat, there's always something happening. Everything connected, everything meaning, nothing whim sagacious filmmaker. Interstellarwas shot IMAX format, quite different size aspect ratio regular 35mm Cinemascope we're used to. So obviously, film best watched largest screen one find (the IMAX screen Hyderabad instance; true IMAX country). But scale visuals trumped scale Chris Nolan's vision, Interstellarwill make out-of-the-ordinary phenomenon screen. Some humanity's greatest achievements finding answers questions confounded generations, answers came reward many moons toil. Patience, seems, always rewarding. Interstellaris quite like that. As twists around time, space everything between, rewards patience, attention curiosity. It also serves measure individual, like cinema, Interstellarisn't everyone.
