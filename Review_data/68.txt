Occasionally startling, mostly boring never scary, week’s Marathi release Aik, directed Pratik Kadam, confused mess horror film. The hackneyed treatment horror scenes apart, biggest problem one involved making seems real idea role filmmaking process is. A young couple child moves spacious apartment Mumbai comes way dirt-cheap. Without much thought large house Mumbai sold cheap, move in, hints provided existing otherworldly force house. From here, film shifts marital problems couple facing. Before long, film moves abandoned palace near Gujarat, husband’s TV channel starting first-of-its-kind live reality horror show. The story film definitely scope. For instance, one interesting things film nature ‘haunting’. The reason behind haunting unique, makes logical sense (to extent film ghosts can) particular people haunted. However, hard give makers film much credit beyond that, manner film treated. Starting look film choice lead cast techniques used give audience chills, everything gives impression lot confusion surrounded making film. Swapnil Jadhav Aditi Sarangdhar, play husband wife respectively, aren’t bad, don’t look like carry film themselves. It hard root manner characters written, also don’t really suit characters much. The screenplay meanders around many issues side characters, particularly reality show bits, distracting main purpose film is. It takes long start getting scary, already run steam then. The unconvincing content seems worse technique. Shots repeated hope one notice, cinematography colour correction inconsistent substandard, production design poor often betrays fact film clearly made really tight budget. Aik best likened ambitious student film. The makers film thought, pull through. What didn’t money expertise make worth audience’s while.
