You know kind cook shows make want regret mix veg nothing-ness dinner? The kind makes forget couldn’t pronounce French dish cooked looks divine? When I first heard Julie & Julia, I thought movie would make feel - nagging concern life going I’m successfully chef. Or least salivating regret I didn’t something creative dinner. The film based lives two women - autobiographical texts Julie Powell (played Amy Adams), hum-drum government employee takes challenge cook 524 recipes Julia Child’s book 'Mastering Art French Cooking' Julia Child’s life first cooking class publishing book. Both women way admit food saved lives. The film draws parallels 1950s, Julia Child (famous American chef, played Meryl Streep) first started taking cooking lessons Paris, early 2000s Julie Powell’s life changed super taxing challenge. We made see similarities lives even though belong different time zones social brackets. Julia Child moved Paris husband, Paul Child (played Stanley Tucci) plush government employee supportive zest something life – play domestic companion him. Quite similar Child, Powell decides boring government job pulling down, especially since friends climbed ladder success. She lives husband, nonchalant yet supportive Eric Powell (Chris Messina) pizzeria Queens, New York. Her one year challenge, witness film, lifts life extremes. She writes blog daily accomplishments, becomes hugely popular. The cooking, however, taxing. You made aware pressure mostly film keeps cutting back Julia Child’s inspirational story became successful chef. The parallel narratives work well two stories, stand similar contradictory many ways. Both women fight vastly different demons: Julie financial situation job coming way aspirations, Julia social mindset women Europe early 1900s. Women cooked home, see Julia Child breaking stereotype standing room full men, skeptical tutor, making own. Yet women searching thing: validation talent. Meryl Streep Julia Child delight, course. You immediately choose side, decide side story tad bit interesting Julie Powell’s. Amy Adams though, makes Powell’s character lot endearing relatable. Both husbands shown extremely supportive wives career, somewhere line, characters get boring. I would preferred refined characters, especially since Nora Ephron (writer director) decides delve deep personal lives women. The DVD Julia & Julia bunch really exciting extras. First featurette titled "Secret Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia", get hear bits real Julie Powell Julia Child’s niece. We also get overview production, might I say, never get enough Meryl Streep screen! She’s charm; want keep watching perform. A part wishes film focused making viewer drool food film. Most food related shows/movies/books end making feel either hungry inspire cook. I felt neither Julie & Julia, maybe focus womens’ trajectory less cooked. While performances main straw Julie & Julia, film surprisingly doesn’t make want cook eat. It makes want sit back ponder women achievements. That’s real win film, isn’t it?
