Shortcut Romeo desperate stylish, desperate story, desperate fill elements considered constitute Hindi thriller - love, drama, action, betrayal. Only thing missing seems comedy, thank goodness mercies. Yet, give leeway trying, even tried way hard. You blackmailer (Neil Nitin Mukesh) taking advantage caught rich woman (Ameesha Patel) red-handed. But lady ain't going take lying gives good fight nasty. Interestingly, supposedly shades good too. The schemes counter-schemes design elaborate lie obviously mercy coincidences, actually happen. Not mention, tad predictable too. The characters either nasty uninteresting invest them. That leaves dialogue writing department pull in. Shortcut Romeo doesn't manage take good lines either. The performances dull one would expect Ameesha Patel Neil Nitin Mukesh. However, latter try hard infuse life lines bring mean streak character. Puja Gupta tries best sensuous simple, ultimately amounts one-expression deal. The rest supporting cast outright bad dialogue delivery body language. Even so, feel like makers give Shortcut Romeo best shot. It doesn't feel like take audience granted. Its ability writer/director engage us limited.
