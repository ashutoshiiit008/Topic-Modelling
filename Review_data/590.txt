I witnessed Kay Kay Menon Rahul Bose Om Puri. As wasn’t trauma enough see Om Puri perform like monkey movies like Buddha Mar Gaya Mere Baap Pehle Aap suffer heart-break Kay Kay Menon Rahul Bose loud over-the-top, shamelessly so. How much torture industry capable of? The thing bad performances considering wisdom slapsticky performances supposed way. But, I really wish exposed versatility capable of. True, Rahul Bose isn’t greatest performer around, Kay Kay…. Just I great regard script choices two make, I giving many Mallika Sherawat sleazy dance numbers scenes benefit doubt. Thinking, maybe script really demands it. Till, I proved wrong Mallika trying seduce audience straight look camera rather sharing chemistry co-stars. Under pretext satirical comment prevalence slapstick Hindi cinema, Maan Gaye Mughal-E-Azam ends adding one “crappy movies” list. It starts trying sarcastic dismal political administrative condition country. But satisfies scratching surface. There intention delving deeper ruffling feathers. And mockery Urdu, Mughal-e-azam, Jaane bhi yaaro for? As far I know, mockery done someone thinks superior things ridiculing. Now really? Can anyone inflated opinion themselves? Especially involved product like this? While I go balm hurt, cinema-crazy soul, general, get I went through, I seriously hope saved bear this.
