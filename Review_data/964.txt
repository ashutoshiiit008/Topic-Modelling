It seems Hollywood offer us week adaptations books. Mira Nair’s screen adaptation Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid’s 2007 book ‘The Reluctant Fundamentalist’ appealed instantly gritty, haunting atmosphere creates right first frame film. However, seldom manages move broad, over-dramatic manner story treated. Mira Nair seems thrown everything film, decided leave subtlety back pocket. Set around fictitious incident international significance traveling back-and-forth time reveal journey protagonist, film potential taut, gripping thriller subtly puts forth message holds – every man responsible choices ideal world, religion would nothing it. However, simplistic loud treatment lets film almost completely, despite much else going it. The film is, heart, intimate story Changez Khan, Pakistani lad aspires generation part world aspire for; success ultimate land dreams opportunity – United States America. Built around central premise story despair, injustice, fanaticism ambiguous morality repercussion ingeniously horrifying terror attack history mankind. The film tackles theme seems staple – life young Pakistani man, living age-old ‘American Dream’, changes completely, post 9/11. It shows you’ve already seen heard – every person South East Asian decent, specifically, every man Muslim surname beard, targeted singled suspicion eventual degradation humiliation. Changez’s journey starts truly engaging you; lot performance Riz Ahmed. The graph character, slow build aspirations love wonderfully captured physicality well eyes. Then, despite eventual direction character takes established weakly, Ahmed holds fort manages carry along him. However, film primarily fails sets film apart regular emotional tale – thriller format narrative. Then black-and-white opposed gray story like stand for. I haven’t read novel, I don’t know sharp lines characters situations etched derived source itself. However, I couldn’t help get feeling book essentially film masquerading novel – story narrative technique appear strong cinematic potential film adaptation almost inevitable. Add visual treatment Nair gives film; I eventually lost count many times I told lost chance film is. Riz Ahmed’s performance ably supported rest cast. Shabana Azmi Om Puri, play Pakistani parents, joy despite brief roles. Kiefer Sutherland Changez’s ice-cool, ambitious boss perfect well. Liev Schreiber plays journalist one half conversation core situation around film set, fair job, I often felt lacked intensity Riz Ahmed had. And one wishes terrific Adil Hussain smile mutter couple scenes. The film also charming little Sufi-flavoured background score one good song. In fact, I said earlier, film lot going makes fair technical achievement. It overdone dramatics thrill factor film really loses plot. The Reluctant Fundamentalist kind film I’d recommend feel satisfied film even aspects – mood, visuals Riz’s performance case – work. Otherwise, may hard find film anything passable.
