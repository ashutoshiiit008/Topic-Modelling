At risk sounding extremely snotty, I didn't think I'd ever consider Hindi romantic film list favorites. But, I am, guilty charged strong contender. There 200% credit give away would split writer Imtiaz Ali director Imtiaz Ali. The writer's decision pick 2 characters focus developing them, making grow people yet keeping consistent difficult one. It must tempting shoot sub-plots. I'm glad ruthlessly avoided. My admiration various directorial decisions kept building movie began. If first minutes film make worry, intentional. Trust capable director. From background music lack thereo,f way scenes sewn together, director's role obvious. Almost every 4th 5th film reviewed background music Salim-Sulaiman one so-not-in-your-face. The flow film one love story another back seamlessly swift. It actually reminded Rang De Basanti, better, story human. Another brilliant stroke genius losing crux story commercial viability. Yet keep tone light enough engage many people audience possible. Cracked Midas touch, we? I haven't particularly liked Deepika Padukone earlier films seeing cast line-up I knew person could get emote would Imtiaz Ali. Just like Kareena Kapoor Jab We Met. And I wasn't disappointed. At least, know Deepika better done thus far. We know come model-like within-her-frame body language. Though I seriously doubt taste costumes chosen "chor bazaari". Minor irritant - shall ignored. Of course, Saif Ali Khan played many romantic role. But playful yet intense, contemporary old-fashioned, happy dissatisfied isn't something many lead actors industry could pull off. And transition character believable without inconsistent. Looks like I'm sort-of back awe writing. It makes think. Is point pulling relationship practical? Is practical give relationship means much you? Do really know much something means till push away try take back will. These times ask "Do love me?" know reply "What love?" Does mean binding finding someone liberates you? Does mean space needs filled good riddance bad rubbish? There solutions issues, let alone easy ones. And one doesn't really give answer film set-up conflict, resolution. This one satisfying climaxes love story. And yet like friend I watched movie said, "I hope 'wrong' friends don't get wrong message." That sentence make sense watch film. And watch film must! So go already! And you've already been, isn't worth another watch? And beauty type likes think much entertainment, you'll still enjoy it. As far looking flaws, I'll watch second time around. Till I'd like feeling enjoyed film completely.
