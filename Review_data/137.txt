There haven’t many films recent past traverse graph Girish Mohite’s Bharatiya does, respect nature narrative. Armed interesting concept, film rocky intriguing much first hour. Thereafter, descends absurdity preachiness kind bound irritate even tolerant viewer point other. The film opens wandering soothsayer, played Makarand Anaspure, breaking fourth wall talking audience. He introduces story unfold, forgotten village called Adnide, located Maharashtra-Karnataka border. The village host expectedly quirky characters. Mohan Agashe Kuldeep Pawar, example, play couple power hungry old men other’s throats, vying head village. The soothsayer goes suggest something explosive soon going happen village. Enter city-bred lad Abhay Sardeshmukh (played Subodh Bhave) intends return village ancestors hailed from, reasons unveil film progresses. The film’s one-word theme quite simple - identity. What mean, belong village, state country, especially one like India, perhaps diverse nation world? Using sleepy village seems run autopilot subject actually doesn’t seem like bad approach explore question. However, story meanders around farfetched situations characters becomes hard take film seriously particular point. That isn’t say film doesn’t entertain. It does, even sporadically, mainly dialogue performances. Pawar Agashe fine form, injecting deadpan comedy near-perfect timing. Jitendra Joshi another actor shines. Last seen playing title role Tukaram, one little alley – confused lover forever eyeing daughter rival. Few people play dumb screen like does, make laugh character well. One must grant Subodh Bhave try best opinionated, petulant do-gooder character Abhay is. However, one much character flat, preachy and, quite frankly, ridiculously silly one is. Intended anchoring pillar film, Abhay’s character quite easily one major flaws film. Switching genres ever often eventually becomes problem film, audience rarely knows expect. While may good thing film solely thriller, one not. Not knowing actually watching political satire means lot situations actually lost you. While director Girish Mohite definitely moved forward since last film, disastrous Pratibimb, Bharatiya still film I’d recommend. In spite generous dose comic moments, Bharatiya eventually becomes tedious watch.
