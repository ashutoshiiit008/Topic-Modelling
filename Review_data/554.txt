Men boys men. Will boys. No matter old man gets, he's never old enough spot fun, even life catches sometimes. In Jon Turteltaub's Last Vegas, four 'boys' late sixties decide get together fun Las Vegas, because, obviously, last get hitched. If The Hangover didn't end trilogy went on, decades, you'd end Last Vegas; easy film dismiss warm to. What keeps going honest camaraderie film's four lead characters, clean humour never transgresses 'haha' territory. (By clean, I don't mean sexually, there's lot 'guy' humour, sexual innuendo likes, film. But clean way seems malintent way film attempts charm audience.) Archie, Paddy, Sam Billy friends 60 years now, still share bond teenagers, even ups downs along way. All said done, stand time comes. Each issues life, physically emotionally. And trip is, way, cathartic them. Each enters different person, better worse, leaves different man - that's pretty much film supposed symbolize character - snapshot personal journeys best friends company. Treated continuous stream humour largely ages, film doesn't try hard make smile. The dialogue never downright hilarious, often relying goody charm anything else. That, veteran actors respective characters' quirks enough ensure film succeeds frothy, breezy watch meant be. There occasional leaps faith film expects take, don't mind meant good fun. The writing nearly always predictable, Turteltaub's direction isn't much functional. This four veterans come save day. Make mistake, none particularly outstanding roles. Just men who've years. The material doesn't challenge one bit, natural talent timing exactly required make work. Kevin Kline steals show adorable Sam, taken 'permission' wife hanky panky, lucky. Michael Douglas plays Billy, is, well, pretty much Michael Douglas; suave, sexy rich bloke who's marrying woman half age. Two absolute all-time favourite actors - Morgan Freeman Robert De Niro - seem made lives' mission pick films characters aren't worthy them. Last Vegas joins list, least couple scenes genuinely make smile, them. The boys ensure Last Vegas watchable, become much easier accept Hollywood mediocrity long isn't big franchise film. Last Vegas isn't absolute must watch, watching four grown boys bit fun isn't particularly bad way spend couple hours either.
