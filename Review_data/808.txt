Unfortunately, also means good either. Anyways, compliments first making brave scripting decisions, important power-of-politics based movie. Though common sense story focal point movie, yet movies far between. So, need applauded come along. But, alas one ultimately fails taking audience thick action. Various tactical twists story, especially towards climax accepted "Sarkar" says so. A riveted Amitabh Bachchan fan might even mind so, especially fan presented intense performance long monologues. There's nothing specifically wrong lines, crisp, occasionally garnished tangy sense humor. But, fair make movie one actor jockeying power various characters interesting? Without taking away anything legendary actor's entire range expressions, I really would liked see characters' motivations instead verdict passed central character. Also, central character really consistent. His motivations way gets influenced/convinced dominant son rather unconvincing. And look Sarkar's character change two movies really unbelievable. A man sensitive stranger's daughter's rape movie ago practical death betrayal. He suffers physical trauma willing treat death collateral damage?! Likewise, Shankar, Sarkar's arrogant, disrespectful son (Abhishek Bachchan), doesn't feel fully developed. His quiet demeanor goes sudden bursts anger. But, somehow father-son relationship seems forced contrived. The emotional bond fuzzy hence taken face value. Due one-dimensional portrayal Abhishek required hold one expression face throughout, minimal variation. Anita (Aishwarya Rai) skimpily etched character. Her interactions Shankar seem extremely superfluous. I think Aishwarya way part written blame it. However, amazing deglamorized looks. And I sure thin line identifying characteristics side characters making look like caricatures dissolves. The supporting cast doesnâ€™t much terms evoking fear hatred. So, resolution ignore rather make peace expected, overactive camerawork ear-splitting, background score worked. Once I decided give things satisfaction reaction, going got little easier delicate grayness head. An occasional cringe unavoidable. I'm human all. The thing is, director love music camera decisions fact proud them. Now, know that, thing register protest - "me likes deafening-is-such-a-mild-word music sway-here-there-and-everywhere camera movements." I must admit, though, I didn't mind relatively limited use close-ups much time around. Part credit would go performances lot way faces lit. The natural source light consistently kept mind I loved fact colors used tune general serious intense tone movie. So, low expectations set previous experiences might contributed towards liking one. But, yet huge chunks movie, especially towards end, I would liked people acting story instead one person sitting reading me. Oh well, worse made yet it's entirely dissatisfying experience.
