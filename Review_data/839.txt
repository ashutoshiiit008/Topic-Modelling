Is marriage dying? No, marriage around you. Marriage - concept, dying? That's question Shudh Desi Romance trying get hold of. You'd think interesting trailers songs film promised. Alas, doesn't work out. 15-20 minutes film know plot falling flat. I've warmed idea confused / listless / loser lead characters since I started seeing poetry tragedy. So, I try find Raghuram Sitaram (Sushant Singh Rajput). That made want love him. Also, Rajput plays youngster earnestness. His confusion though boyish, comes across "man"-like thing do. Yes, yes, stereotyping all. But, I imagine many women going "these men!" look "he can't express himself" angle. He charm, yet difficult see vibrant, confidently aggressive women - two one - fallen him. What's say love, again? Let's say blind, is. So, two blind women loser. Even I told watching film, strong faith Jaideep Sahni I'd still look forward it. And doesn't disappoint - well, least dialogue. The lines earthy, snappy, delivered well. In fact, things keep film going. And Rishi Kapoor, course - thank goodness him! After all, there's much keep interested events get repetitive. And I hard time accepting Jaideep Sahni's work. True, pattern every person's behavior, especially comes love life. But, repetition isn't interesting enough sail 2+ hours. It's almost makers realised getting boring characters break fourth wall explain motives us. For one, characters weren't deeply sketched us many questions motivation. And then, things better left unsaid. Also, realistic treatment film gets art director, rude intrusion. Not B-town neighbours accepting young couple live-in relationship real. But, accept realism makers wish even foresee. It helps Parineeti Chopra Vaani Kapoor make Gayatri Tara seem comfortable are. Except comes intimate guy love with. I must admit here, awkard first kiss charming way. But, difficult believe couple comfortable sing sorts aren't singing love life. After comments varying topics US' involvement wars world-wide safety women India, boils lyrics one songs - 'chanchal mann, ati random...' (Flitting mind/heart, random) - Shudh Desi Romance - zeal pertinent, comes across rather random.
