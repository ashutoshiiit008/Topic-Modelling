Heartbreaker’s premise sounded like another offshoot Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. In French. I instantly knew I go see film, especially since India serious French movies get released (if all). It almost field day romantic me, able see French rom-com. And even though it’s predictable, structured film – Romain Duris (of Russian Dolls The Beat That My Heart Skipped fame) pulls film through. Alex (Duris), along sister husband (Julie Ferrier François Damiens) unique business - breakup marriages/relationships. The opening scene film steals you; set Morocco it’s crisp entertaining 15 minutes describing Alex’s craft women. He’s typical rom-com anti-hero-who-becomes-the-hero, one claims never fall love, especially clients. And find wanting believe him, pretty admirable film genre. Alex’s method simple. He convinces rather vulnerable targets partners right them, charming woman’s pants off, except keeps professional. This makes witty fascinating quarter film. It goes downhill minute meets, trailers refer “his match” i.e. girl capable making fall love. Currently Monaco, gets assignment break upcoming marriage wine connoisseur Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) – also French ingredient Heartbreaker, everything else (structure, formulas, clothing, background music subtitled dialogues) wannabe Hollywood. So much even Juliette's best friend Sophie (Helen Noguerra) sex fiend magically makes Juliette look classy. Typical. The salvage Paradis’ looks like elegant, aristocratic sweetheart – image comes virtue friend's behaviour, works appearance. Alex enters Juliette’s life bodyguard. And even though seems reluctant first break wedding due 10 days, forced financial desperation – lagging, unnecessary subplot involving irrelevant goons thugs. The rest movie becomes like liability; one forced watch given option beginning. You simply fall love Alex, curse predictably falls love Juliette. Heartbreaker good-looking movie, it’s one tries hard. The subtitles timed don’t get feeling it’s language might understand. Halfway Heartbreaker, it’s like makers forgot add ounce charm. The plot starts beginning feel heavy – background music little mushy. I’m surprised American studio bought rights yet. All praise Romain Duris, though, absolute charmer brings movie watchable slate. Maybe cold winter afternoon girlfriends.
