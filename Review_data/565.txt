Brittany Murphy weird looking – cute face, bug-like eyes. It’s pity didn’t horror films time, bless soul. She certainly eyes it. And therefore, I reservations seeing chick flick. So I picked rarer film (she’s also done Uptown Girls Clueless), sometimes find best performances film many haven’t heard of. Little Black Book traces Stacy Holt’s (Murphy) dream TV anchor. She works associate producer unsuccessful show – insecure relationship. Perfect fodder witty fairytale-ending chick flick, right? Well, Little Black Book debases expectations film – big win me. But manner leaves spellbound. We walk Stacy spies commitment phobic boyfriend, browsing Palm Pilot (Blackberry-type device). With sloppy pace, sift Stacy’s insecurities meets ex-girlfriends meticulously compares them. The funny element film enters here. Probably strongest reason pick DVD (if you’re Sex The City kind mood is) entire theme unapologetic insecurity. Murphy pulls perfectly credit goes entirely looks. While meets girlfriends, entire laugh-worthy voice dominates film. It’s raw, unapologetic director Nick Hurran great job making tone absolutely non-judgmental. The DVD film one feature (among extended trailers theatrical posters), making called "Live & On The Air: The Making Little Black Book". It’s fun, entertaining watch there’s 3-min interview Murphy she’s asked would indulge sort snooping around. Her calculated, diplomatic answers deliberately hide tone guilt exactly emblematic film. Little Black Book kind unabashed, satirical tone self-righteous relationships eternal strife perfect. That way, film unlike chick flicks. It almost promotes snooping crazy neurotic behavior. In 2009, Murphy died cardiac arrest remember strangely petite looking girl films like 8 Mile, commercial-singing freak Clueless. However, it’s Little Black Book seems unnervingly charming self-talking, insecure honesty. Little Black Book isn’t great film; real “story” mostly overpowered need make mush moments winner among chick flick lovers. We flat performances; side characters barely contribute, including boyfriend Derek. But it’s sloppy film see sneaky, neurotic underhand side relationship – truly original interpretation romance!
