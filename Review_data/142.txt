Just experience watching film like Bhoot Returns theater annoying, audience sure come comedy film masked horror film never stop giggling. Save minutes last quarter film wasn't minute silence audience. Continious chitter-chatter and/or laughter happening screen rather NOT happening. The plot barely moved inch first half. Night turned day day turned night, nights getting longer material stayed pretty much same. The attempt replicating Paranormal Activity effect superficial quite plainly didn't work. While days passed, dialogue outright hilarious inane. While might intentionally comic like say hide-and-seek sequence, looked silly. For change though background music, albeit loud, used little differently created tiny bit tension. The use 3D hand, rather comical. It employed either give wide-angle effect make items foreground obstruct view things/people background. While Manisha Koirala decent job scared, character Namrata disturbingly standard loving mother. Even mother self-centered, difficult imagine yelling child obviously need help. The rest cast okay dismal tele-marketing kind dubbing Madhu Shalini extremely distracting. Not mention, reason existence film seemed add X factor, there's nothing she, possessed child's aunt either parent couldn't done. Personal judgments role definitions aside much advertised horrifying climax bit uncomfortable digest. And maybe exactly aim film â€“ make audience uncomfortable thought. Yet, makes sick even think might people okay conclusion implies. My usual complaint child artists play roles possessed humans stays though, I guess, I relatively relieved kept one sequence intense either. While one thank Mr Verma keeping film short 90 minutes, re-return Bhoot seems imminent. And that, I certainly wary of.
