An auspicious red golden cloth flies across bright blue Los Angeles sky. It intercut shots source destination - Sim's (Kareena Kapoor's) purse Viraj's (Akshay Kumar's) face. Creativity 50s-90s reproduces Kambakkht Ishq. What thinking? Sorry, "thinking" way big word. Usually, even it's bad film, I end saying, "at least put money flow, good economy." But, I cannot stop hurting crores crores Rupees drowning drain core earth. What prompted supposed top-of-the-line stars country entertain no-line (ouch...just can't make call plot) expect film-starved country entertained? Unless definition entertainment changed - slo-mo entries, cake fight wedding, slap-a-thing-slap-it-again, leching, disgusting innuendos, forth. The loud-louder-loudest, loud-louder-loudest contest Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor, Aftab Shivdasani, Amrita Arora, Jaaved Jaffrey, Kirron Kher basically entire cast insufferable. Kirron Kher Jaaved Jaffrey retire genre. For matter Akshay Kareena AND US good allowing projects find way screen. Kareena looks good almost always does. So, what's value-addition made particular set makers? Having stalwarts Hindi films cameo film pass√©. Hollywood new trend. So, looks like stock-footage Bruce Willis Angelina Jolie attending "Stuntman's award ceremony". Then Denise Richards, Sylvester Stallone Brandon small gigs. And case miss them, don't recognize them, name repeated every appearance. So, much creative dialogue. The creativity actually lie giving credits - Pooja Batra credited "acquiring foreign stars". Wonder "acquired Bollywood ones"? The lines bad, jokes lousy needless say predictable. The overall film cannot called obvious say word "film" know it's going end. Little I know "establishing characters" bit going go next 2.5 hours! I wondering constant comments Akshay Kareena other's IQ actually hint audience still watching film first 10 minutes. More often not, movies scale good songs choreography aesthetic sense. Not here. Music typical Anu Malik stuff. The lyrics although bit interesting usual. I don't remember ever remembered mom often watching film. The brain went rhythmic pattern internally yelling "MUMMMMY!!!" every couple minutes. The monsoon set guys. Go watch leaves caress cool air. Certainly beats awkward Akshay-Kareena lip-locks lip-pecks.
