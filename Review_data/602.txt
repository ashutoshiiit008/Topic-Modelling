It refreshing watch Hindi film lengthened forcing romantic track songs. I understand, shouldn't reason bump film's rating up. Unfortunately film, one main things come with. NOT social issue trying create awareness about. Till film starts getting preachy goes monologue, Mardaani well-narrated story elements in-sync. But, last fifteen minutes downhill towards typical thriller. That say, action last bit engaging. It fact slick Rani Mukherjee moves smartly. But, voiceover explains things worked out, biggest turn-off thriller. And shame till Mardaani didn't single dull moment. It's plot twists weren't forseeable. You could see, biggest turning points story minutes happened. But, since rooting right thing happen, don't mind predictability. The writing great extent keeps intrigued one means other. Even though, usual trappings supercop film. Like, showing cop's happy family one one reason. And course, loopholes leaps faith. On hand, things writing department takes head-on. The dialogue witty, even way abuses delivered sound forced, effect, rather natural. But, lines bring smile make smirk. The lead characters written reasonably well too. The topic sexual trafficking audience already rooting story. In addition, Mardaani's bad guy instills fear appropriately. Also, rarity Hindi films, see enjoy vibrant chemistry protagonist antagonist. This Shivani (Rani Mukherjee) villain (Tahir Bhasin) hardly physical space. Again, it's often sides equally smart, cool unfazed. Of course, wouldn't worked hadn't Rani Mukherjee Tahir Bhasin's performances. Though Rani Mukherjee starts loud, soon get used it, character written way. She's strong fight her. Always. It commendable ounce glamor around Rani Mukherjee stays character throughout. My usual gripe movies address social issues make characters (usually main leads) representative larger group people say, youth women common man. Which bad itself, story slips character symbolic said group. Mardaani saves trap film. It telling story one lady officer taken upon get bad guy personal reason (to start with) moves larger purpose. It also refreshing film doesn't make much ado women-centric. It sticks points one - thriller two - talking trafficking. Sort-of neutralises fact film woman center ironically called, Mardaani. Yes, child trafficking sexual crimes needs awareness. Yes, films need made issues. Yes, Mardaani decent film. Alas, issue come thinking about. I wonder censor cuts took away bits needed get us involved suffered. But, meanwhile, do. And go give, Lakshmi watch too. Note, I saying instead, I saying both. Each different approach - one worth watch ought watched.
