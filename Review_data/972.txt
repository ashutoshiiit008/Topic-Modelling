A mysterious woman train coupled mistaken identity tourist, definitely sounds interesting. Add inept cops clichéd gangster Russian henchmen, The Tourist. The plot looks intriguing trailer, turns extremely stupid. It slow, dialogues. The story pick silly thriller. It mostly predictable, nothing happens movie! The value talented cast cinematography. There zero adrenaline moments. The amount focus Elise (Angelina Jolie) made think would turn something like Hitchcock movie. But expectations, even flair. I always wonder cops movies stupid, one adds curiosity. People standing around passively pistols shot, makes entire thing look unreal. The lack real twists weighs hard film’s genre. Plus physics action sequences baffling. Almost unbelievable, therefore irritating. And I say gangsters? Ah, losers. I looking forward film Johnny Depp. But sadly, nothing substantial movie. He comical, charm. But I used seeing playing quirky, character driven parts, feels odd see play normal role. Angelina Jolie sure looks ravenous - I mean ravishing. She pulls role confident woman doesn’t like circumstances controlling manipulating vulnerable tourist. Another thing I liked film dark like thrillers. The mood throughout film light, touch comedy flicker romance. The one-liners enjoyable, though you'd seen trailer. Venice made even prettier times day chosen shoot her. Unhurried verbose, film best mediocre. Jolie fans might like since lot close-ups. Depp fans find disappointment. Wait DVD really want watch it. Else, might well give one pass.
