Update: The director given interpretation movie here. It interesting read along interpretations here. Of course, articles spoilers. But, mind, wouldn't matter much even reading these, could come interpretation own, go open mind. Happy watching! A four-letter expletive repeated thrice I left with. In excited tone. In "I don't believe I saw Hindi" tone. And fascinatingly "It beyond completely comprehend I saw one take" tone. The beauty abstract concepts almost many meanings viewers. What paradox!? Something obviously meaningful many meanings clear statement! Oh, I digress? Coming point - movie treat senses. The background music, sound design, camerawork, special effects - worked towards narrating idea. Nope, I cannot make say I saw story; visual description idea - 'what if...?' Such cinema might proverbial "everyone's cup tea". But, point is, available enjoy different flavor. Thank you, Mr. Director! John Abraham plays K absolutely everything movie K's point view. But, don't let keep away, even wary acting skills. Because literally 'unbelievably' good. The transition self-obsessed, full-of-himself man person lost grip remarkable. Especially came us performance merely lines given him. However, could certainly survived without animated thought bubbles. What exactly purpose? They funny, insightful - especially since could make John thinking body language movement facial muscles (yes believe me, actually that!). It joy watch Paresh Rawal making fool himself. But performance lacked punch character demanded. A powerful, menacing "Sri Sri Sri ... baba" would great. The dialogues nice crisp, absent needed - leaving lot room interpretation. At least couple metaphors decipher. Especially, commentary infinite self-improvement programmes resorted days. Do umpteen movie awards given bravery award? I guess not. I think time come start one first one go 'No smoking' Not technical brilliance, concept itself. Sadly, though, might go well many people. And exposed world cinema, seen similar stuff before. But, I admire I able watch theater screens mainstream Hindi movies people applauded credits started rolling. The question I still struggling - Would I liked much obscure ideas translating movies? Well, I'd say bring we'll know!
