A hard-core, hot-headed, cold-blooded criminal past resurfaces unknown ways. It surprises showing fuzzy, warm side. In "opposite attracts" sense, feels natural another person's purity amuse eventually draw person. And played well too. It clear story writer's focus main character, Shivam (Emraan Hashmi). There attempt talk characters. They given, fact accept reject - call. Similarly couple coincidences main plot difficult digest presented matter-of-factly manner - take leave - writer couldn't care less. There attempt make characters interesting. For example, Malik (Ashutosh Rana) person takes pride fact good judging people motivations, true time? How take it? Good thought audience chew on, addressed satisfactorily. Such character developments given strong conclusion set-up deserved. Very rarely Hindi movie build whole story around one character sticks that. No back story villain, side-kick, lead lady - nothing! While hurts little bit, least usual objection mixing genres held bay. The focus Shivam makes character study least much interesting. The product becomes worth watch story Shivam. The writer's implied arrogance however easily forgiven, due justice done Shivam's stylization depth character portrayed. All would lost, Emraan Hashmi composed restrained performance. Be romancer lady, action-master gangster, loner, loser looking meaning life. I wish something could done voice. (Or done already? I donâ€™t remember voice jarring whimpy recent films.) The person really impressed performance Purab Kohli playing madcap goon thinks owns world. It took recognize him. This act rather make-up. On hand women nothing evoke emotion. It'd unfair blame writing doesn't justice characters. One plain vanilla, difficult situation woman could find one scene shows gravity situation comes way late. Sure, first scene tell us situation, isn't followed up. The next scene shows lap luxury. It feels like major continuity glitch writing, like forgot write couple scenes. The introductory scenes Mohit Suri's films impressive disappointing. They CSI episode kind expose build half exciting. That's because, basic plot criminal seeking redemption done rounds often enough. They try add little depth including family feud chaos efficient outsider's (Shivam's) presence already tense situation. But, goes nowhere ultimately falls flat face. The filmmakers allude spirituality existentialism throughout film. Afterall monster trying become Buddha. If done conviction didn't succumb out-of-context song dance. It's slow, serious film. And though tries hard, it's subtle. Note: I saw film Satellite TV.
