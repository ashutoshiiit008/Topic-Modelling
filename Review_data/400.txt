Here's thing - I'm unable take Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson seriously I watch big screen; I'm sure loads people who've known WWE days feel quite same. Despite sizeable fan following (which explains film opened quite well BO) tried hard vary choice roles, one can't slide away fact owing muscular physique affable screen presence, certain kinds roles chosen for, he's them. Brett Ratner's take Greek mythology's Hercules adapted graphic novel, truth told, Dwayne Johnson sure suits part. He looks almost superhuman, sinews appearing capable enough pull feats shown film. But, said done, Hercules nothing VFX-heavy, testosterone-fuelled Hollywood sameness; version Kick, will. Oh, actually semblance plot film. Hercules, exile mercenary hire, brought defend kingdom Thrace mysterious invader. Things get murky, however, even Hercules battles demons. Luckily enough, doesn't seem like either Rayner Johnson taking film seriously, least most. There's bit humour, loads action even Johnson playing gallery. The portions seem like taking seriously are, unsurprisingly, weakest portions film. Mercifully, film brisk, least one twist flags interest begin feel monotony set in. And there's decently executed close combat action, addition grand battle scenes. Not gorgeous, uber-stylish kind 300, rugged, believable kind. The trick getting bored film like Hercules, then, play along lead actor director, dish passable film. Don't expect much, Hercules least won't make regret watching it.
