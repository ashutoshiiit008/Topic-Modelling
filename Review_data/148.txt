When successful franchise hand survived three decades viewership, maker would want expand frontiers. While counterpart Don series moved forward story, Ultimate Star Tamil films decided tread different path, going back time tell genesis story David Billa (the Tamil version Don). While original story usually stresses formative days titular character, Billa, urge see history much revered Don surmounts thanks insufficient material available reclusive gangster. But five minutes movie, best dialogue trailer wasted terribly, I suspected dreadful times await me. As happened, 2 long hours, Billa-2 stood testament film, matter good star has, tech-savvy & creative technicians involved, good creative vision director helm affairs. The problem I Billa-2 couldn’t justify hunger violence protagonist; welcomed many maniac want world burn. I didn’t even mind fact film monotonously escalation rampant man. Hell, I could even tolerate plump hero whip win masculine enemies jiffy. But issue really convincing factor deployed it. You really can’t make action movie action sequences weakest link. From opening sequence fight, till much talked helicopter fight scene, nowhere violent rage seeps David Billa’s face fill screen space. As result able see computer generated blood bursting cadaver even knife touches it. On hindsight, wonderful punch lines well-intended scenes ebb crevice, like much needed crest long trough, Billa-2 moments then, making wonder writers couldn’t diligent work. Had creators understood taking audience coda important coda itself. Billa-2 sure would adrenaline pumping movie. Unfortunately present form, Billa-2 nothing 2 hours stretched version 2 minutes trailer 1 hour 48 minutes boredom. If film answers something, tells origin story plump Ajith Kumar walks way become trim & fit Billa 2007 film.
