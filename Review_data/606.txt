There's always story behind film made every viewer likes voice thinks must've panned out. So Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola might rolled. Not-so-sober Vishal Bharadwaj: This system frustrating, politicians despicably corrupt, businessmen making biryani farmer's blood labor, country going tube. We need something! Sober Vishal Bharadwaj: Let's make movie. Not-so-sober VB: Ah-ha! Why not? People protest participating peace marches, wearing pink chaddis, replace display pictures black dots Facebook Twitter. They know do, I know make films. Perfect. Sober VB: But, political shoo-shaa, angst farmer, etc serious, aam junta get terribly bored. Not-so-sober VB: Political satire is, then! Sober VB: Good thinking, there! Let's add love angle mix, good measure. Not-so-sober VB: You think? I hoping add woman mix like vamp. Sober VB: You yours, I'll mine. Deal? Not-so-sober: Only let go little crazy. Sober VB: Crazy good, multiplex junta loves it! Not-so-sober VB: Promise me, won't let go focus issue love triangle. Sober VB: I'll sign papers, don't go overboard crazy bit I agreed. Not-so-sober VB: Yes! dances happily-ever-after dance Anything repeated often long, like film's quirkiness reviewing style, gets old soon. Fortunately unfortunately, not-so-sober VB sober VB got make films, respectively. Yes, usual, not-so-sober one makes sense. Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola starts bang incredibly insane title - readies zaniness look forward to. The 'no smoking' disclaimer witty, ironical, slap-in-the-face start film. The buffoonery begins builds "you got kiddin' me" level. And right moment, decent element story added form strong, burning issue country. The issue hand represents many issues faced real world. The politician represents citizens perceive politicians. And see play footsie businessmen whose deep pockets want grow deeper taking entire nation ride. Then, wait big climax, wait drama reach peak, wait big climax, wait exhilaration bring along, wait big climax. And doesn't come. I ever-so-grateful Vishal Bharadwaj making climax huge jingoistic movement. I also grateful characters make u-turns basic natures. I can't even complain end silly I indeed thought it'd atrociously out-of-this-world kind-of silly. I feeling I'd enjoyed way build-up craziness. Unfortunately, doesn't go way. Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola cannot claim three characters Matru, Bijli Mandola either. None given depth relationships paid attention to. To seal anti-climax, comes title song made solely purpose marketing give Rohit-Shetty/Farah-Khan worthy shudder see Shabana Azmi (who plays vamp) signature dance step! Why? It one thing make political satire serious issue quite another market movie comedy fun without letting audience seriousness. Are viewers worthy knowing film really about? Or makers guts selling product is? Make Shabana Azmi dance out-of-context, really? I can't get it. And yet, despite episodic side-plots, Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola complete wash-out. It disarmingly witty dialogue, especially reserved Mandola (Pankaj Kapur). There least three scenes second half stay powerful lines, insight, sarcasm, delivery. And don't work you, Pankaj Kapur's performance alone enough carry film you. From mumbling alcoholic delirious alcohol-quitter stone-sober, cold businessman - Pankaj Kapur whole range without going over-the-top despite genre goofy satire film belongs to. Shabana Azmi holds ground ambitious manipulative politician. She one scene could shined in. But overpowered theatrical setting necessary powerful insightful dialogue delivers. Imran Khan doesn't much scope different usual except occasionally slipping Haryanvi accent. And I said, like anything repeated often long, Anushka Sharma's wink-and-grin-wide routine getting old too. Arya Babbar gets play stupid well plays appropriately. I don't mind serious film, I don't mind socio-politics, I don't mind satire, I certainly don't mind quirky, dark humor. What I don't get though film can't pick one two themes stick - there, build-up end like makers believed making, without external pressures.
