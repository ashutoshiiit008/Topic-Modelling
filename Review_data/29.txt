It simple good Hirani-land. You beg, borrow steal good faith lovable, charming person land idiots. And much ever I hate use fiction realistic set-up, I end enjoying worlds. Maybe because, like people, I want believe possible good mean-mean world. Also it's nice see comment educational system Indian-parent psyche, competing kill invention creativity. In fact, time around, felt like Rajkumar Hirani taken upon challenge every single complaint I typical Hindi masala films. I hate slapstick. He uses - it's justified (the setting boy-dominated college all-boy hostel.) And DAMN! He makes laugh Mr. Bean-Tom & Jerrystyle jokes. And loud toilet sex-related jokes! :( He uses sttuppid marriage-melodrama scene. Yet, I'm egging bride run away, completely disregarding little change plan-of-action Hirani employs. As typical slaptick comedies actors ping-pong loud melodramatic. You call brilliant acting, say cannot judge actor genre demands - take pick. Then there's slapsticky, loud background music too. And list goes on. I want hate man's guts, can't help admire way typical toilet-humor fluidly mixes insight comes next. Though I fear he's taking slapstick little ventures. A little towards making content appeal palate "masses". Be overuse songs clich√©s smartly covered guise spoofs. Using 40 year old actor play 17 year old. It mildly irritating time, next time annoyance might increase. But doesn't mean hasn't taken risks. The lead lady Pia (Kareen Kapoor) makes first appearance screen 45th minute film. The kind humor uses risky. Such serious, sensitive, real issues laughed whole-heartedly - characters. Such dark humor! And well, audience laughing, doesn't reduce risk taken, right? This might obvious statement one make film, say seen it. This film would hollow without dialogues delivery. And despite occasional shallow humor. And even sms/e-mail forwards. Its lead that's engaging. All fingers point back man, Rajkumar Hirani, written dialogues directed delivery. While phrases coined become references everyday conversations, mantra "Aal izz well" taken extreme film's writing. The screenplay makes sure audience knows beginning "aall izz well" end. So, yeah, call predictable. And events predictable screenplay given one extra second think guess what's going happen next. But semantics. The point raised answered predictable moment something you'd think - least time. Another huge element writing - characterization - mostly done use caricatures. From Chatur/Silencer Prof. Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani); supposedly-soon-to-be son-in-law even Rancho (Aamir Khan), look like comic book. But seen character like circle friends - one names price/brand object ask it, one competitive ad nauseum, one spouts philosophy every third second. But lingering element masala missed. There gray characters. Rancho, example, huge strokes Raghu Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Bawarchi. But still something mysterious Raghu, something made curious him. But here, know Rancho could evil even wanted to. And yet Rancho makes laugh, jerks tears. One emotion high, time. But, question I films give "message" lighter vein - laughs stick message? Will laugh every time someone says "o bhaiyya, aal izz well" subscribe fact "all's well"?
