Continuing rather puzzling trend Malayalam films bearing English titles, Ranjith Sankar’s latest film, Molly Aunty Rocks, simplistic, occasionally enjoyable film whose primary USP set decent, smile-inducing performances. Revathy plays Molly, popularly known Molly Aunty, NRI living Kerala last two years, husband children still US. She’s upright, law-abiding slightly comical; bank employee progressive thought used manner things done ‘by book’ US. Thus, often gets tiffs people who, like us India, aren’t worried things ‘right way’. Molly Aunty Rocks maintains feel-good, frothy sense throughout. Molly runs bunch situations handles manner intended make audience smile cheer even. However, one can’t help get sense everything sanitized. The characters one identify family members problem way is, definitely likely reaction one would character like Molly. However, number characters seem go way help out, make one wonder why. One gets feeling real life situation, would strange character like many well-wishers. The biggest flaw film screenplay. The whole set events happen first half much second half supposed build suspense end revelation supposed clear audience’s doubts Molly’s motivations. However, build-up weak revelation occurs audience realizes supposed suspense element first place. Also, film seems way long good. At time Malayalam films clearly trying best compete World cinema, right pace film absolutely critical truly hold audience. As mentioned earlier, strength film lies performances. All said done, Revathy pitch-perfect. She one finest actresses India has, performance proves it. Prithviraj makes late entry film, excellent. A fine, young actor, makes role own. The supporting cast film good job. If characters fleshed more, lot attention paid little details, along sharper screenplay, film could really good, slice-of-life story struggles one go ‘the system’ India. However, stands, Molly Aunty Rocks isn’t complete waste audience’s time, amount fun situations performances. But isn’t must-see standard.
