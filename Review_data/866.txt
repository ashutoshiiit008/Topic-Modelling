Stanley ka Dabba, title warmed film. I used lazy one school who'd never get "tiffin box". And little sister would pack early morning. I don't know, dabba never fascinating enough. Years later, I watch Stanley ka Dabba, I realize maybe 'bonding' thing me. Many friends made shared parathas buscuits. Sure, Stanley's reason bringing food far laziness could be, fact didnâ€™t meal brought result. Many friends lovely memories. Despite fondness though, Stanley ka Dabba seemed slow, predictable repetitive 95 minute duration. Stanley ka Dabba's promo also makes believe going something really deep film take repeated viewings deconstruct. It raises question Stanley's background remains unanswered till last ten minutes film. By then, pretty much made sad story family probable life-style situation. And climax gives exactly that. In sense, film unpredictable, right? You expecting something more, something beyond superficial didn't get it. But says every film zen moment realization? For is, Stanley ka Dabba perfectly enjoyable simplicity relatable is. A science teacher constantly asks stick norms, unreasonable Hindi teacher insists Goddess knowledge oblige use right hand. Stanley ka Dabba simple things like fact every student come traditional Indian school environment find something smile at. And can't identify events film, there's always Stanley smile with. Partho plays charming Stanley, master story-teller, strong self-esteem. In fact, kids film perfect roles - almost aren't acting all. The kids theater around seemed love every minute spent Stanley. They didn't seem mind slow pace repetition. It didn't matter seemed valid reason angst resolution thereof Stanley Hindi teacher. Nor care climax nothing outside box. The protagonist hero story tugs right strings lumpy throat. I'm really curious film going liked film festivals Indian international. The context Indian. In fact, documentation education system culture revolving schools India. Fortunately, "new-age" schools might changing teacher-facing experience. Unfortunately though might changing dabba experience too.
