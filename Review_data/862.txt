When Special Chabbis ends, go entire film mind (you helped repeated scenes end) realize scenes film, put track cracking mystery. Why else would people know talk like strangers story? Till then, holding Akshay Kumar, Anupam Kher others moving slo-mo made guy made A Wednesday - HAS lead something good. In fact, entire film feels like moving slow motion, even camera job regular speed. And yet giving leeway. Good thing smart one-liners delivered really good timing keep interested film. That doesn't mean performances top-notch. Except Anupam Kher Manoj Bajpayee, rest plain. I cannot deny it's relief see Akshay Kumar role isn't "comic" antics. Kajal Aggarwal fairer gender representation. Divya Dutt given one line repeat whenever predictably appropriate third woman around told husband wear dupatta! The way camera moves along women's curves makes film respectful women film item number X-factor. These things don't expect watching A Wednesday. Yes, one Neeraj Pandey set competition himself. I enjoyed set-up. The film gives audience time figure things themselves. Especially 'who's what' bit isn't aided people talking meeting first time, voice-over trying help us out. However, becomes bit drab later, feel continuously exposition mode. In fact, given end, entire film feels like introduction sequel, series films. It sad then, see out-of-place stylization lackluster conclusion. Also, lead players film going nice people, need good amount background them, able root them. None lead characters, except Mr. Sharma (Anupam Kher) certain extent, get invested them. Nothing keep hooked out. Sure, sentiment hurting corrupt nation, giving deserve. But, seemed half-baked felt like comment passing. Another side note one country's administration law enforcement believes something basic checking credentials. Are trusting nation? Yet, forgive writer Neeraj Pandey going way fool believing something, couple twists make smile way characters seem outsmarting other. But, along lame love story, quirks exist sake quirky, con-jobbers written con other.
