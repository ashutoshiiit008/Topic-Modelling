You wait thrills shrills begin. You wait wait wait. Finally, hour half later, don't get shreiks alright - thank goodness mercies - get interesting premise hook in. Too late? May be. Too little? May be. Just way much time spent establishing flaky love affair. You don't know one fallen love another stays love either. Given number things cause mistrust love should've fallen apart couple days relationship. Anyway, so, much-too-much love happens South Africa, Goa, Mumbai I'm sure exotic locations. There air mystery experienced audience inkling it's misleading. When, real mystery unveiled, sit up. A world possibilities opens up. A lot test-of-character bound occur. These opportunities utilized well too. The question whether forgive time spent getting there. Here, warned even events last half hour tad predictable. Not necessarily step ahead makers seen before, given extra thirty seconds guess happen next. And likely going guess right. Aditi Rao Hydari's performance makes things engaging. I hope gets role soon, use talent seems have. Randeep Hooda Sara Loren carry typical plastic expressions I associate genre horror/thrillers produced. Randeep little less Sara, Sara's drone-like dialogue delivery. The background music tries hard create spook fails. The camera doesn't try pull anything outside box. The songs like recent product Bhatt factory. Why makers willing let go clich√©s? Why difficult go beyond? Especially willingly accepted drawing another film - La cara oculta, Spanish time. You cannot help think - given combination woman's instinct insecurity physical atmosphere claustrophobia, Murder 3 ought arrested us.
