One distinguishing factor Shyamalan – Brand movies easily placed two extreme categories: Stimulating Good Hair-wrenching bad. If The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable Signs fall former category, know The Village Lady In The Water make feel. It’s delivers alternates – also holds true latest film Devil. Devil story worked inner recesses Shyamalan’s head given form screenwriter Brian Nelson (of 30 Days Night fame) Director John Eric Dowdle (of Quarantine fame). First part Shyamalan produced Night Chronicles, Devil based premise called Devil’s Meeting – Devil takes human form, traps sinned unknown location, kills torturing them. Devil deals foundation 5 people stuck elevator gets murdered one another occasional blackouts. Shyamalan admitted film loosely based Agatha Christie’s novel ‘And Then There Were None’, main inspiration behind film Hitchcock. With background – writer, director, premise influences – Devil sounded like chilling, mind-bender. Allow place two-sided argument movie decide category movie falls under. You can’t go terribly wrong regular whodunit Hitchcock Christie footprints it. Devil classic eye-popping twist end couple bumps throughout film, make anticipated chill stop midway spine - it’s something haven’t experience before. Fernando Velázquez provides typical horror movie background music- banging high octave piano keys like someone taking slow cautionary steps. The cinematography moves tight shots people trapped elevator establish claustrophobia, inter-cut crane shots sky-scrapper people stuck. The symbolism meaty, still bit overdone – becomes cloudy grey minute people get stuck, bang middle 40 odd floors building 6th elevator. There definitely melodramatic, old school charm Devil; it’s perfect amalgamation Christie novel, Hitchcock thriller contemporary horror visuals. The problem arrangement lack originality – nothing new Devil offers 2010 film. If read seen enough horror/thriller genre able make correct guesses film, you’ll still want sit out, formulas never go wrong. The DVD Devil extended trailers, deleted scenes don’t contribute much film – anything film crisp 79 mins long. The DVD also includes featurette making film – little arrogant Shyamalan’s interview also intriguing discusses myths surrounding premise film. Devil won’t excite like guilty pleasure would, 79 minutes decently spent, you’re mood average movie fine fusion influences. Watch Devil won’t disappointed overall experience film. Almost like indulgence junk food would – it’s good inviting way stimulating.
