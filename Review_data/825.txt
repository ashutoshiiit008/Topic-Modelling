Sharyat made impact posters – Sachin Pilgaonkar’s fiery look rustic feel I got it. While film definitely re-write cinematic history, Sharyat important film Marathi cinema. Finally, technique Marathi cinema seems coming age. Sharyat impressive production, looks slick spite village setting, also manages squeeze Matrix-esque bullet-time shots. True, times technique seems over-done. There overdose motion blurs ramped jib movements, film often appears excessively colour-corrected. However, I’m willing overlook interest larger picture – one say technique hasn’t reached shores Marathi cinema. Directed co-written Viju Mane, Sharyat firstly needs lauded choice theme. It revolves around traditional bullock cart races held rural Maharashtra, fierce battles ensue gain specific honour victory annual races bestows. Sachin plays Dhananjay, ace bull racer hasn’t raced five years tragedy forced leave village altogether. Circumstances bring life full circle him, race yet multitude reasons. The film, surprisingly, share flaws, screenplay biggest. It could far taut even main plot; half-baked love-story side makes worse. Thus, spite fact film’s runtime shade two hours, stills seems longer needed be. It also often prone top drama inane plot twists. Adding film’s woes three unnecessary songs - two item numbers (one particularly derivative silly hook line) one romantic song (which incidentally looks lot like ‘Ishq Sufiyana’ The Dirty Picture.) The songs fairly ordinary. The memorable song entire film title track ‘Sharyat Lagli’. It catchy placed well film. While major complaints regards performances film, I often found wishing Sachin’s dialogue delivery little less stilted stoic. He great intensity completely looks part. But times way delivered dialogue didn’t justice emotion eyes. Sachin Juvekar, plays Sachin’s brother, mostly endearing, occasional tendency go top. Veteran Marathi film TV actor, Neena Kulkarni (also known face Hindi films) plays part well. Tejashree Pradhan pleasant, truly insignificant role. Which brings back technique. Marathi films, sheer lack commercial viability, never able match scale technique Hindi Tamil films. In fact, days even average budget Malayalam film significantly higher Marathi film. While truly pity, bright side Marathi filmmakers forced stretch every rupee try make films ‘look good’. For reason alone, Sharyat (reportedly made budget 3 crore) film proud of. In spite glaring flaws otherwise could put off, Sharyat film I don’t regret spending money on, I could see filmmaker’s intent make sure one could look film say Marathi films shoddily produced. Hopefully, Sharyat set new precedent technique Marathi cinema.
