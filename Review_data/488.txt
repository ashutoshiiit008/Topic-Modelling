Eons passed yet aren’t sure whether response signature pose mere appearance mass hero wonderful build-up fitting coda. But, Allu Arjun (the mass-hero Julayi) comes frame suddenly dog crossing street, left none three factors cheer mass-hero. However, past master is, director, Trivikram compensates conjuring enticing bank robbery next scene show acumen beloved hero. Julayi, mass commercial formula notwithstanding, story clash intellects. While protagonist impatient youth, can't wait climb ladder riches, antagonist self-conceited criminal. While former tends bend rules achieve dream, latter exudes passion art robbery. What binds together though, willpower unorthodox yet street smart brain. With alluring concept, Trivikram starts crazy entertainer wonderful witty lines thrown - dialogues always Trivikram's strong hold. Unfortunately, game progresses, dialogues become shackle incoherent script. Where riveting action & pertinent lines, exorbitant action & brimming lines.
