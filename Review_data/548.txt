Most sports-themed films I've seen based sport I've enjoyed watching, least bit. I always wondered differently film would appeal person interested sport, doesn't know rules. Today, I part audience. It difficult say I didn't enjoy film I don't like sport one bit not-so well made film. My problem boxing - kind - brutal game also seemed like wrong one pick theme peace. I know, argued irony whole point film. But, didn't go well me, all. I imagine film banned Pakistan. I'm sure we'd furor country shown evil, manipulative cheaters. And top off, film Pakistanis right thing right time. Also, much sense make show individuals country hating government using machinery end war. Maybe it's closer truth. Scary I still don't see helps process peace. The film standard story. You win some, lose some. You drive home point. I actually liked way conflict resolved, concept. But, way done, bulk character transformations much gulp down. As far-fetched possibility, character conversions would worked actors done half-way decent job acting. Interestingly, Aanahad good growling boxing games compared stone-face body carried even supposedly playful. Some awful dialogue delivery possible. And done inspiration around seems Nafisa Ali. Sushant Singh, Farookh Shaikh Saurabh Shukla good support roles can't make expressionless cast around. So, theme didn't appeal me, performances nothing hold interest. The thing worked camerawork. It really accentuated well-choreographed action sequences. How true game, I wouldn't able tell. A slow narrative family hurt person another country deals situation. It uses usual means, new moves. And I don't see engage, educate, entertain?
