Being student science supposedly something extraordinary world Bhagnanis. That spend significant part first hour telling us lead hero unique Physics interests him. But actually makes irreplacable knows sweep woman feet, fight 5 "machos", muscles worth showing off, move feet put Hrithik Roshans day shame...if think I'm exaggerating, blame writers film! If, far, haven't reminded superhero 90s, take this. This story supposedly comedy, drama, suspense, melodrama, romance, revenge, drama, I'm sure I'm missing genre two. And yet one bit entertaining. Each element looked like part scene first visualized scenario built around connections scenarios after. Be fight sequences romantic ones. So, Jacky Bhagnani - Uday Chopra look-alike cringes nose expresses sadness blank face like Fardeen Khan. Giving credit it's due, can't annoyingly Fardeen. Then there's Vaishali Desai annoying she's arrogant - what, I haven't clue. The worst-worst hit seeing Riteish Deshmukh play comic relief doesn't get laugh. That hurts, really does. That Archana Puran Singh little less irritating usual hardly consolation. Neither hero villain none interesting characters. The hero course hero - ever-so-nice 24x7 one all, including people insult rhyme reason. The villain doesn't inspire us even raise finger him, let alone hate him. His motivations unknown aren't motivated find either. Like films nature, songs come go like guests film cheap motel. No rhythm, need. The lyrics tad better one would expect set-up like this. The theater usher asked girl watched film, "how like film?" Her answer says all. "Sad..." And thought tragedy film.
