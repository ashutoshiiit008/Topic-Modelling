All us crazy, way other. As much we’d like pretend sane others not, there’s escaping fact something inside every single person face earth makes weird, insane, times, downright neurotic. Each us square block trying best fit round hole. In charming little world created David O. Russell Silver Linings Playbook, host dysfunctional characters deal little insanities everyday life, coming terms loss, friendship love. Far typical romantic comedy, film warm ride smile-inducing moments characters can’t help fall love with. We peek lives, walk leave them, knowing they’ll continue madness; all, incidental spectators. We immediately introduced Pat, spent last eight months psychiatric facility Baltimore, reasons explained little later film. His mother signs takes back home Philadelphia, get bringing normalcy back life. But precisely film deals with; exactly ‘normal’? Pat, married man, gets task setting things right life estranged wife, meets Tiffany, recently-widowed woman issues. Together, set helping deal mess respective lives. The first, instant connect one makes film manner characters speak other; seems real, real life, rarely people talk full sentences conversation. We often cut off, often speak simultaneously almost often talk listen. The writing, direction performances work beautifully together achieve effect characters conversing people real life. Also, every character little lunacy finds resonance within level. So there’s Pat’s obsessive-compulsive father superstitious presence absence objects people watching football game. Then there’s mate psychiatric hospital talk hair; many others, can’t help adore. What I really liked film fact always know going, doesn’t stop film surprising throughout. It thrives simple principle journey matters destination; get end matters end itself. So, even story isn’t novel way, screenplay tinged humour everyday lines events, odd outlandish situation make smile wide. My real problems film largely technical – minor directorial oversights like suspect choice shot framing, particularly long dialogue scenes, well frequent axis jumps. Axis jumps fine long don’t ruin illusion continuity, often film. Also, I often got feeling number dialogues scenes far longer, cut short – call taken edit stage, I suspect. The plethora nominations wins cast film garnered comes surprise; every single one outstanding. Bradley Cooper always likeable, charming presence screen. But turn Pat comes huge surprise. He manages capture every little beat character’s quirks beautifully blows away. The gorgeous Jennifer Lawrence, best known role Katniss Evergreen The Hunger Games, manages spring wonderful performance Tiffany. Tiffany is, possible, even crazier character Pat, Lawrence completely wins heart performance. I didn’t know turn mature performance young age. I glad see one favourite actors, Robert De Niro, back form long time. After slew indifferent characters played lately, finally sinks teeth heartwarming character Pat’s father. Jacki Weaver plays Pat’s mother; expresses eyes words, wonderful job well. One favourite actors, Anupam Kher, plays Pat’s psychiatrist film. He small role, joy watch. Also, relief finally Indian actor speak silly accent Hollywood film. No one buys old-fashioned romantic comedy anymore, both, romance comedy, invariably cranked beyond necessary. Silver Linings Playbook new age romantic comedy, one romance comedy far real identifiable. It film heart well sense humour, bound charm you. Watch film; good chance you’ll smiling throughout, you’ll leave cinema smiling.
