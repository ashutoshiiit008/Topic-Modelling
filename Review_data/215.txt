I like look draw positives every movie; positive I drew The Collection least worst film I’ve watched big screen year isn’t Indian one. The Collection, sheer virtue genre, caters niche audience. After all, many people like spend hour half watching body parts dismembered, human beings tortured sharp steel jaws spikes, hairy tarantulas walking girl’s face likes. Such people way stay away films like others ilk. But films genre hardcore, loyal audience. Though I don’t particularly belong category, I enjoy blood-and-gore screen, done well. In fact, I actually liked first installment Saw, 'seminal' film genre, I could say thing. The films series went bad worse, another story. Or Eli Roth’s Hostel matter, another film I quite enjoyed B-movie indulgence. From Dusk Till Dawn another film comes mind - though vampires, equally gory. Here though, I doubt even hardcore loyalists draw anything The Collection. A random assortment torture murder scenes regard space, time logic, kind film makes 82 minutes seem like eternity some. And isn’t wanton castration human bodies problem. The excruciating non-imaginativeness every scene situation without even semblance effort inject slightest credibility treatment makes almost wish someone drove rusty steel spike instead. At least torture would end then. All films, good bad, ‘story’. This one too; particularly silly one. Through montage newscasts, introduced fact violent serial killer prowl – one kills numbers random locations abducts people scene, whereabouts completely unknown that. Inevitably, abducts girl, sets chain events lead group men women trapped abandoned hotel actually maze-like deathly lair belonging masked serial killer. His barbaric instruments torture death over; tripping tiny thread cause god-knows-what horrific contraption skewer you. It doesn’t help firstly writers director, cast, take way seriously. Had chosen go Robert Rodriguez film, could actually made hangout movie; friends laugh snigger people involved film laugh well. No luck here. Everyone clearly believed masterpiece making. The cast full familiar faces, familiar names; bit actors who’ve made fleeting appearances big movies. On1 level I actually felt bad them. They clearly impression big break stardom, certainly not. The Collection supposedly sequel cult horror film, The Collector, also directed Marcus Dunstan, director co-writer film. I haven’t watched that, anything like this, I’m glad I haven’t, The Collection scrapes bottom cinematic barrel.
