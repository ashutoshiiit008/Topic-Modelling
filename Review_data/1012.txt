It touching. It sweet. The romance good true. Yet level works, chemistry works. But, where's "hum" Mr.Devgan? I saw "U". Why Mrs. denied character development? Of course, U argue movie Ajay's point view. But behave like love cheese call it, U Me Aur Hum? The story clear set-up, conflict resolution. I like pace romance builds cruise ship tribute Titanic. The conflict chosen however, specific wonder whether resolution applicable situations. Especially considering Ajay Devgan, person, wants people work relationships rather let go. Yet, manage make think "how much would I willing give relationship?" Again, problem hand specific enough warrant research. A cursory glance around web raises couple questions. To extent, movie specific issues, overall idea love also means enjoying blindness. But issue much crux story can't ignored. And obsession boy child? "To own" good, really need kind propaganda influential medium? The issue female infanticide rampant India one doesn't even need research. Coming back romance, lot pretentious dialogue going back forth, alright till Ashwani Dhir gets sentences "repeated words". He takes scheme sentence formation along joke release week Krazzy 4 too. So, repeating across movies too! Not mentions key scenes lacked punch. But, particular monologue getting tedious Ajay changes tone completely takes off. It touches right chord. Yeah, credit go Ajay Devgan that. I always felt it's difficult director direct well. But comes directing others, Ajay missed mark. Almost everyone supporting cast over-the-top. Of course, Kajol done best get us involved situation despite lack depth writer, Ajay Devgan, etches her. Though get shrill self every while. But I'm still miffed short hand dealt. More credit Ajay, time regard experimenting camera. And course Aseem Bajaj executing director's vision. Most film shot subject camera background. And out-of-focus object foreground - chair, person showpiece lying table subject sitting behind. I found interesting I always inkling evironment character focus in. However, Ajay Kajol stylish, elegant personalities, beautiful looking people. Close-ups aging faces avoided, especially playing characters 10 years younger are. Munna Dhiman decent job lyrics. The witty words flow well music thus don't strain hard understand. The music however, functional. Despite flaws, U Me Aur Hum touches tender spot, makes tear roll, sets thinking love really means you.
