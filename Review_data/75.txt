You could call Hindi Harry Potter 7-crushed into-1 dash X-men thrown in. Or, matter, look super-hero story. BUT, could also think Aladin huge step forward Hindi films terms graphics cute imagination - however small might be. Don't expect sort deviation writing department though. Oops! Did I give movie away? Oh well, like wouldn't guess first 5 minutes. Also, still don't know dim-wit like Aladin (Riteish Deshmukh) manages keep evil forces taking over. There fascinating revelations life human behavior. There aims loftier power. I don't know you? But, I thought Aladin adventures, like love story. The first thing takes awe first 15-20 minutes lovely sets. The sand-colored stones, fortress like look done really well know fairly land spurts color showing screen. You town more-or-less nameless bound time. You see TVs wood-finished remote controls. You milkman's cycle vintage cars. The special effects also fascinating. I wondered I seeing Hindi film. And answer resounding NO! I would equally appreciated film part world. The action sequences smoothly cut put together. The camera moves lyrically somehow never gets story book. Unfortunately, there's nothing else that's average here. I shouldn't repeating often story oft-repeated. :) Not that, slacks quite bit first half hour. Also jumps story make feel like watching movie based book lost 50 pages every 50 pages. The intriguing suspense beginning built sorted-out pretty disappointingly. The acting I guess requires everyone behave little over-the-top. I'm loud-act-makes-me-laugh audience, I wouldn't know people like would enjoy it. I think it’s lame excuse name appealing kids. We developing better tastes next generation. But, given supposed act loud larger-than-life Amitabh Bachchan Sanjay Dutt enchant. We knew capable it, see again. Oh, heart sinks giving movie starring Big B low rating. You want look 65-year screen full dancers. How pulls entire song makes elegant, simplest choreography … sigh oh well… Riteish Deshmukh succeeds, looks like effortlessly, playing larger-than-life idiot! Some scenes two Aladin's screen (just like that!) make respect even actor. Even two expressions could hold. And what's special Jacqueline Fernandez, again? Not chalk-white face whiter make-up, right? And songs get one many thus way often spoil too! For Hollywood, one must-must-watch! Others could say, "baah! I've seen Hollywood - like 100 times over." Or could watch like would watch next Holly-thriller-action-superhero movie typical No-one-can-save-the-world-but-me plotline. And yet, sequel, I would look forward it, hope's lost.
