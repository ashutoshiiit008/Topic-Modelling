For brief moment there, I thought Lekar Hum Deewana Dil aiming something larger, something beyond noone suspected off, something urban youth sensitized interiors India looks like, even feels like. But, fleeting moment. Other that, run-down version domestic bickering baseless many domestic quarrels. Not fights like don't make good stories even movies. But don't empathize petty selfish lady smitten boy, there's little hope. I'm negative characters main leads I like seeing not-so-nice side heroes. But, don't inspire interest. The performances could've blamed I gotten superficially written characters were. For bit, I consider possibility characters intentionally made inconsiderate towards people around them, portray apathy urban youth. But towards end, difficult believe intention. The rest writing, movie generic could get hardly meat terms dialogue, supporting roles, music, etc. Lekar Hum Deewana Dil one films can't even say could better potential. It's case there, seen many those.
