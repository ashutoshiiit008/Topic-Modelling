The oil glossy glitter associated mainstream Hindi cinema. Isn't shame movie called one without "stars"? As soon Vinay Pathak makes laugh way locks briefcase, star. If I yell, "aaa-ouch" Rajat Kapoor gets hit back already hurting, isn't something right? Dialogues characters made repeat every opportunity possible usually make sick. But, time, I could caught laughing loud couple dialogues. Here, subtle integral part personality - forced, squeezed increase line-count actor. I laughed anticipation every time. For reason even predictable misunderstandings made laugh. And I thought, "okay enough now, going funny anymore", character didn't say movie ended soon thereafter. The makers knew push far. That understanding, ability resist temptation one time, creditable. Sorry, didn't mean take away anything lines repeated. Most dialogues witty keep splits throughout! Like dialogues, things irritate real life used irritate characters get laugh audience. E.g., sound effect used exaggerate noise created handling plastic bag hilarious needs special mention. This cinematic liberties taken. And allowed to. There things that, maybe, 'outside scope movie' maker's point view left audience questions. Like inconsistency Sarika's character. (Read "what didn't work" section). The problem short role, Ranveer Shorey overacted. Yes, read right. Granted asked pull face modulate voice certain manner. But didn't work. His character looked rather out-of-place otherwise believable set characters. However, something worked. More half Milind Soman's lines appropriately - Laugh. And laugh heartily. The wonderful part movie much joke simpleton clerk arrogant upper class businessman. And yes, certainly kinds characters would annoyed them, ready burst laughing someone else. They make fondly remember guys college sources entertainment "talent" personalities. I wouldn't wait DVD kind comedy needs encouraged - intentional.
