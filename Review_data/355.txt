Some antics best left Tom & Jerry. That kind violence funny humans it, especially set really long Ekta Kapoor soap opera. Yep, Golmaal Returns bad! What's trend half dialogues referring another movie/ TV show? Every scene one reference Sanjay Leela Bhansali taking worst hit. How many movies going this? Is creativity limited laughing another's expense? Which could grudgingly acceptable done least little less crudely. Like Golmaal, Tusshar Kapoor's mute character comes welcome relief midst screaming yelping. And one managed make laugh. And became repetitive. Women, supposed expect, mere eye candy referred men's property. Jealousy emotion allowed. It almost felt like particular women cast balance men looks department. I see reason casting Celina Jaitley Shreyas Talpade Amrita Arora Arshad Warsi. The Ajay Devgan-Kareena Kapoor pair alright Omkara feels like complete mismatch. Especially Kareena behaves insecure Ajay's faithfulness. And don't even get started badly placed picturized songs are. And sound awful too. The silver lining dark, dark cloud I completely enjoyed transitions used put together two scenes. So much I began waiting scene end, I could see going move next one. Of course, reason I wanted scene scene end, nevertheless credit given due. So, many would see movie transitions? There's scene towards end member cast walks towards noose hanging tree threatening commit suicide. Now, three cheers one!
