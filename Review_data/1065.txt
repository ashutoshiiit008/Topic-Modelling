I option studying Greek Literature college, seemed interesting evil fathers, Oedipal sons ostracized siblings – much like plot television shows. I didn’t opt finally, watching weeks’ Wrath Titans I thought I read bit Greek Mythology, movie watching experience could devoid questions. Wrong move. If you’re going watch Wrath Titans (I strongly suggest spend money otherwise), please treat another action film heroes fighting monsters created computer nothing more. (Think Clash titans, John Carter suchlike) Sequel 2010’s Clash Titans, Wrath Titans isn’t intriguing celebration Greek mythology laced universal morals passed generations. Maybe I wishful believe so, I proven wrong watered version mash Transformers Immortals. The film begins demi-god, Persues (Sam Washington) humble life fisherman. He visited Zeus (played Laim Neeson) informs gods losing Godliness Humans dangerous war brewing. Together, Zeus, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) Posiedon (Danny Huston) overthrown Persues’ evil father Kronos, must strike deal regain power remain immortal. While brother battling gain autonomy, Persues’, hero (and yes, built chosen first place) must save human-race. Wrath Titans lacks sense story structure. For sequel, assumes viewer seen previous film well-versed small nitty-gritty’s every character’s history. It’s like expecting remember relatives’ middle names remotely related you. Before clear doubt, monster pops screen: three-headed made-up animals puffed man-buffulo, you’re expecting pretty much anything pop screen “threat”. The CG team real winner here. There’s energy story-telling. When revisit older era, culture, habits look starkly different, representation usually one awe passion. Passion bring world read books importantly passion tell story based world. Wrath Titans looked like videogame – enthusiasm performances (a waste talented Ralph Fiennes), confused sense structure overkill visual effects. I strongly recommend miss one.
