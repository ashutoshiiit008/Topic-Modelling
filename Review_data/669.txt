A man found stealing mango. Situation 1: He's chased beaten pulp thrown jail. Situation 2: The chasers realize he's eaten anything 5 days that's he's stealing. You beat way jail. Situation 3: The chasers realize stealing children wife. They haven't eaten 5 days. You give warning let go. Situation 4: The chasers realize stealing family duped loan-shark. You might actually go beat loanshark. Suppose mango stolen. But couple buildings downtown Manhattan conspired blow successfully. Not pardonable, right? Even similar situation 4. But, course. Suppose he, you? Now, do? This debate New York struggles with. It doesn't offer solutions show one right path - script's beauty. For, ain't straightforward answer dilemma. Yeah, there's loads stereotyping - whites painted darkest hue black. What whites whites, you? After insanity inhumanity racial profiling prevalent everywhere. That's exactly security guards every building gate doing. That's exactly barricades middle city roads for. All good, message nice. Arguments sides convincing thus engaging. But, here's biggest BUT all...why over-dramatize it? It's Aditya Chopra, know there's going drama. The 'over' overtly annoying doesn't provide much relief interval. It actually reminded days VCRs mom would forward half Hindi film. The background music on-the-ear except place two it's really well done. The close-ups beautiful places need ruggedness beauty. The slo-mo's arrrrrgggh!...yep...frustratingly irritating. Disturbing flow, distracting plot jazz! And happens time, key plot points. The one much talked intense scene completely spoilt camera gimmickry. Whatever catches director's producer's fancy, found place film, thus making much longer film necessary. It didn't look like Kabir Khan film all. Did producer much directing producing? Thankfully producer, who's also writer, also fair job writing overall plot. And comparison reasonably well-received films like Black Friday Fanaa, similar elements. And I didn't really like. The point struggle frustration people discriminated against. And made well enough us curious what's next, despite gaps. What scheme? What plan? Why small gang FBI's radar? The writer couldn't bothered details. And minute details given wish weren't could've predicted 30 seconds ago. There surely must ways create suspense give extra brooding time kill it. Same goes (lack of) punch one-liners. But restricted first half. The second half becomes heavy gripping. Inspite glaring NO-NOs, there's quite bit cherish. The performances brilliant. Now would've thought space would said Katrina Kaif John Abraham? Okay it's relative, brilliant compared earlier non-performances. Katrina Kaif, expected Aditya Chopra story, strong role support. She looks usual pretty self, time around, makes feel accent doesn't bother much. John Abraham actually convey character's emotions he's shown New York shows how. It's unfair much said actors like Irrfan Khan "his usual best". The penalty one pay talented. Neil Nitin Mukesh good looks like he's capable much more, needs find variety. So, can't keep bling YR film? When constant, visible struggle supposed "mass pleasing" need mood story get over? They edging make films make difference. They made moves film won't popular. Then go whole 9 yards? Or taking one baby step time...pushing envelope? I hope so.
