When walk film, whether like it, come sense film about, wanted say do. That succeeded failed you, way narrated, different matter. Issaq doesn't give chance assess latter bit. You left wondering about. Is love story backdrop politics? Is family feud? Is Maoists? You'd believe someone said wasn't anything all. When film something, makes "something" innate part narrative. At least, In romance, you'd feel like rooting couple. Instead, crowd cheered bad things happened them, grey shades them. For me, worse, I indifferent happened them. You clue Rahul (Prateik Babbar) )and Bachchi (Amyra Dastur) love other. You don't know loyalties lie. Every time feel know next step be, exact opposite character saying. That's really right kind unpredictability. You don't feel anything all. To top off, barely chemistry two actors. Prateik Babbar's dialogue delivery worst. The pauses takes sentence make feel like watching primary school play. Amyra Dastur, comparison, seems like ace-rate performer, really isn't. Except one scene read poetry, great job of, performance doesn't get attention all. Unfortunately, scene seems rather context performance wasted context film. Similarly, lot things feel context. While disorienting enough South Indian Maoists Varanasi, portrayed psychopaths and/or terrorists bothered more. There disconcerting randomness chose kill. Prashant Narayanan, character plays leader, could walk one sleep. So, yeah, film wasn't remotely Maoism either. That leaves political angle funniest bit. You know Tittas (Ravi Kissen) lover supposedly political sidekick is. You know even lesser two gangster-politicians asked fear beginning film. However, given nothing fear them. In fact, once, come across meek, disable men. When else fails, usually something technical departments keep going. The music, dances, action. No hope here, either. All left is, one botched scene other. In fact, entire film, quite literally looks like, scenes shot sewn together pretty much random order. For example, felt like Prateik Babbar jump roof tops could action element film. Oh well! Not world expected Issaq, it's like come back disappointed. You feel sad people claim take Romeo Juliet Varanasi.
