If evil within you, nothing struggle against. If dilemmas, internal conquests make, don't make interesting characters. If characters don't interest me, I'm audience tapping feet, waiting something unpredictable happen. If don't make anything unpredictable happen, I awed much slick cinematography, smart editing pulsing background music. The point there's attempt make point degenerating youth, different way. But style gets share, dry runs trying shock, fail. And yet performances make film worth watch. It makes sit take notice. All short role Raj Kumar Yadav main characters played Shiv Pandit, Gulshan Devaiya, Kirti Kulhari, Neil Bhoopalam, course Rajeev Khandelwal. We always knew Kalki Koechlincan play doped out, girl-woman. Here see another facet. The one perfect comic timing. Sure, awesome one-liners. And character sense humor darker mine (yes, I inflated opinion dark sense humor). Kalki takes insensitive bitch next level. And that's best writers do. The odd one-liner. Where's depth engross characters? The twists make sit edge? There's quip native language, marwadi, translates - Don't trust fate/luck? Usually used someone's eating there's tomorrow. Looks like director, Bejoy Nambiar doesn't trust fate. Which put everything thought quirky one film - whether belonged not0. Lest didn't get another chance. One example, Amy's (Kalki) excuse cold shown us fairy-tale like atmosphere. That doesn't fit otherwise morbid story-telling. Maybe wrong judgment. Everyone allowed those. But examples. Dark characters find spot couldn't possibly get tighter. At point, Bejoy breaks fourth wall, character talk camera text superimposed screen!? Totally rocks boat you've settled in. Maybe, maybe, intentional. Maybe characters lost marbles can't think straight anymore. Maybe, youth Bejoy seems commenting beyond redemption find comedy great tragedy created. I'd given benefit doubt rest writing supported it. Can killing someone accident make callous enough kill will? Without doubt, situation Khoya Khoya Chand set brilliantly edited. And I liked use slow motion song (ahem!). Yet, looked like part Bejoy's showreel rather Shaitan. Yes, one us devil made us home. Yes, need fight constantly make world livable. Yes, it's beautiful concept needs explored Hindi cinema. Yes, remains so.
