For 89 mins, The Darkest Hour crisp, fairly-spine chilling film gives necessary thrills, considering good part film visuals. But again, film alien invasion banks heavily upon visuals. It seems director Chris Gorak (also art director Fight Club director Wanted) takes pre-requisite bit seriously. The Darkest Hour flat characters, almost plot development, forgive forget submerge chilly background music scary pace. The film starts Moscow, two Americans Sean Ben arrive sell high-flying technological software. They meet two American girls eventually (Natalie Anne – fact don’t second names, let alone back story give enough proof lack depth film) party night away. It’s invisible aliens - look like lethal, dusty mirage - eat entire city, killing every single living being. We shown alien’s point-of-view well – humans look like walking tissues, coming contact them, humans get reduced dust. The film tracks survivors first attack (all four Americans handful Russians meet way) battle way apocalyptic mess find in. If need couple reasons watch film, you’ll happy know effects scare-factor maximum. It’s phenomenon I find apocalyptic films common regardless basic plot. You going find idea world (as know it) coming end, extremely creepy. It’s must-have film content (like The Day After Tomorrow 2012). The Darkest Hour banks factor. The first half hour truly terrifying, learn ignore unexciting acting lead foursome (Emile Hirsch, Olivia Thirlby, Rachael Taylor Max Minghella) soon enough realize color palate, plot development threat (aka aliens) pretty flat. It’s simple; aliens going invisible, plot keep viewer hooked topping horror-factor every then. What see The Darkest Hour incident repeated again. People dying way (barring one bus sequence keeps edge seat), sporadically, get spooked unexpectedness. The real winner The Darkest Hour cinematographer, Scott Kevan, puts front us extremely gripping visual dark city threat supernatural forces. It’s sight bring chills dusty, invisible aliens, repetitive background scores one-dimensional, predictable performances.
