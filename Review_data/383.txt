Breakfast table conversation morning - My 6 year old son - "Dad, mom going review Hari Puttar today, right?" His dad - "yes" Son - "It like Home Alone, only." Me - "Why say so?" Son - "Because brain told I watched trailer. See, there's one boy big house, asks koi hai (anyone there?), means he's alone. And 2 chors (thieves)" Me - Hmmm... (thinking interview) Son - "I want watch it, Home Alone also good." Like mother, like son - never loses hope... But avail. This one easily declared dud, since efforts change ambience tweak concept pretentious. As made satisfy copyright law makers care about. Seriously, going make even half effort details, bother? Might well copy frame frame done it. You clue difficult watch one objectively, without comparison. Let's say, it's lousy-lousy copy - Home Alone, take scene Kungfu Hustle I'm sure bits Carry On one directors claims so. Actually, bit originality contextual alteration. We one burglars using abusive language appropriately beeped off. Now, one would kids' movie beyond me. To top off, 10-year old smothered skimpily clad Shamita Shetty sundry bunch women. Hmph... Many time remakes, story fails, departments compensate. But here, performances try complement loud character slapsticky tone. Except Zain Swini seem enthusiastic look like fun troubling adults around. But everything else - costumes two burglars, sets locations, background music - appealing all. If nothing else, plain simple continuity make sense mayhem? Na-ah! I think I'm going get entire Home Alone series DVD/VCD kids. Much rather watch those. On hand, interesting see react Hari Puttar see whether think one favorites ruined. It's 90 minutes all. Oops! That'd mean I'll watch again. No thanks, I think I'll pass.
