Anyone going expecting Bheja Fry - Part 2 disappointed. Anyone going expecting laugh-out-loud comedy disappointed. The people hope satisfied Vinay Pathak believers. That too, same. But we'll make since we've paid ticket. This serious case give much money, disciplined child become spoilt brat. You aerial shots cruise ships remote island locales. Itâ€™s cool, it's great even. But sake creating situation sounded great head? Especially regional jokes least funny all! I don't know it's boon Vinay Pathak around save film curse spent time it. Kay Kay Menon would sleep walked Bheja Fry 2 amateur days (if anything like him, is.) Amongst rest Minissha Lamba first half Amole Gupte second. She clueless loud, deafeningly loud. Amole Gupte's character equally place too. In fact, everything second half goes over-the-top. It becomes like Tom Jerry show, waiting become funny. Or getting stuck admiring brilliant simpleton vs. snotty idea first film, knowing milk further. Dear Mr. Ballary, I want see senseless, plotless film wants make laugh fails miserably. I guaranteed avenues. I don't want precious money reserved smaller films spent kind tripe. New tripe, I'm ready for. But thing over, na-ah. It hurts, know? I mean, it's fantabulous jazz independent filmmakers get money make films good first show. It's even better Vinay Pathak screen. Heaven knows much I love seeing moustache muscle moving actor's face. Or dimple. But hurts, know how, Ready makes laugh little Vinay Pathak-Kay Kay Menon film.
