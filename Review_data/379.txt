Oh I lashed reviews conveniently resorted clichéd lines like, “feel good film”. I never understood it, always thought better ways describe film. But like say, Karma b****. A ago, I randomly picked British director Mike Leigh’s film, Happy Go Lucky recommendation friend. With Sally Hawkins lead (of Woody Allen’s Cassandra’s Dream fame), seemed like promising film jarringly positive optimistic protagonist, Poppy. Lo behold, first thought was, “Wow, feel good film!” Sigh, life. Happy Go Lucky struck film – it’s plot heavy all. It’s film woman early thirties lives independent single life London positive things. Simple? Double yes much endearing. It’s harder role play say, Desdemona Othello. She must happy, cheerful, positive times film, sun rose within body. She sifts job elementary teacher surprisingly she’s delight children. She shares comfortable relationship cynical roommate Zoe, forced see life extremely cheerful glasses thrusts front eyes. The relevance character however comes starts taking driving lessons Scott (Eddie Marson), bitter, antisocial, conspiracy-spitting, absolute contrast Poppy. It’s encounters truly enjoy film, stripped form. When hear conversations – ranting everything wrong world asking relax live little – understand dynamics human identity. The credit mostly goes Mike Leigh, able show different viewpoints colorful way. The DVD Happy Go Lucky includes commentary Mike Leigh, 18-minute making-of featurette driving lesson scenes Scott Poppy. It’s hilarious watch jokes behind scene commentary Sally Hawkins provides - makes see witty side reality. It also includes 27-minute interview Mike Leigh talks characters, envisioned play role Poppy. While film progresses see Poppy go difficult relationships, situations. And get reduced silence contemplation every then, idea film able let us ponder little complaints insignificant issues. Alternatively, Poppy, wears grin every scene never loses hope. I know it’s easier portrayed film done, make feel-good (gah!) film make believe adopt refreshed perspective life easy. It’s simple road; optimism. Infact, it’s rather brave make film it, risk criticized ignorant, unreal works. Speaks volumes Mike Leigh’s insight human perspectives manifested. Inspite depressing moments film (it few), emerges almost guide book. The kind trying tell you, “Have ever really lost anything optimist?”
