It time year again, I go futile exercise reviewing Salman Khan film. The thing want watch it, watch anyways couldn't pay don't want watch it, (why would want anyway?) Kick typical Salman Khan film gets, plus tad bit story, tad bit attempt keeping things sorted, tad bit attempt acting usual Salman Khan (not I expecting it). He enters style. He stays, swaggers mouths sytlish lines style. No one else matters, though technically try succeed audience cared. I must confess, I think I finally get Salmania about. The thing gets nerves - complete lack acting skills. Tell I got right - knows cannot act knows get away - makes Salman Khan, Salman Khan. Right? The over-confidence. When I saw try emote little usual, even I felt like whistling. No, that's magic Salman Khan. That's magic rock-bottom expectations. Oh listening speak English refreshing too. It relief listen lines see trailer, repeated every 10 minutes remind us cool Salman Khan is. In fact, lines actually enjoyable even discount fact rest entire theater splits trip cheering delight, irrespective what's happening screen. They hooting joy anything everything. Should I then, discount also joy whole theater went uproar Nawazuddin Siddiqui's entry? Even short appearance, leaves remarkable impression. As part quirky character, makes sound every while. It hilarious audience repeat sound every time came screen. Now, audience engagement completely different level. Notice, lot film's experience comes audience reacts (even come pre-determined good time). As I sit here, writing review, I wonder I'd given film points, I hadn't seen 600-seater enjoy completely. Would I enjoyed film is? Nope. Because ultimately, film story told. And bits highly irksome. Yes, back 'thinking' Salman Khan film. How I stop brain working I see Salman Khan's character, Devi beat living daylights bunch people onlookers eve-teasing beats offenders themselves, next sequence pretty much stalking woman? The first half film pretty much that. Devi wooing Shaina, psychiatrist, one whose first lines film is, "Mental ho kya?" (Do mental problem?) No wonder professional's dad looking either provide look husband earn enough live by. I would tried make assessment lead lady's performance, inconsequential, despite good hour revolving around her, doesn't matter. In sense, Kick actually two stories force-fitted make feature length film. One girl-met-boy story, good-vs-evil. So, disconnected don't even bother mentioning latter bit first half former part happens lying around good-vs-evil part film. The connecting bit Randeep Hooda's character, Himanshu Tyagi. He looks good part apt amount smug. Within story too, enough continuity jerks logical loopholes make 1000-word article own. When try fill us logic, wish didn't. So, might well stick aims objectives audience is, "leave brain behind, whistle enjoy", waste effort would be. Other that, Kick feels stilted aware Salman Khan film. The songs come appropriate commercial doses. The cinematography better would expect film Salman Khan genre, doesn't give film whole, many bonus points. I didn't like Kick much + 599 theater loved (with two girls side, making plans see Tuesday) = say, 300 crores?
