Having served Assistant Director original Malayalam film, Manichithrathazu (The Ornate Lock), starring Mohanlal, Shobhana, Suresh Gopi, Priyadarshan taken upon remake film Hindi Bhool Bhulaiya. The film also remade Kannada Telugu, famously Tamil, Rajnikant lead. Having unleashed spate shallow, loud, situational gag oriented comedies, remakes various Malayalam films, Bhool Bhulaiya requires Priyadarshan tackle something need engage far; namely script revolves around psychological perturbation one characters. This perturbation causes certain effects, see sequence film unspools. The cause revealed towards end, justifies climax film. All major characters film part “Great Indian family”; karta sister, respective spouses children, nephew returned America new bride. The non ‘family’ character significant psychiatrist, played Akshay Kumar. The director unable decide whether would like film comedy sound serious note; first half sees trying squeeze laughter audience forcing ‘senior family’ members act like half wits, second half suddenly becomes somber doom laden. This necessitates sudden change character psychiatrist, happy ham loudly members family. Unfortunately sudden shift mood leaves viewer laughing least contemplating ‘serious’ part film, includes climax, mild amusement. The director unable create sustain ambience tempo involves viewer empathizing collective ordeals family members, well lead protagonist. From slightly abstract perspective, film seen clash western rationality religious superstitition (as embodied myths belief occult) represented film clash two generations: one steeped rituals esoteric practices living ‘Hindu small town’, other, embodied modern western educated characters hold ‘professional’ occupations. This theme exemplified film character psychiatrist ‘modern’ psychology versus mumbo jumbo religious priests. Towards end film change shown happening one characters. This change could possibly interpreted omnivorous female sexuality reasserting face insipid patriarchal matrimony!!!! This sexuality subversive threatening existing patriarchal order hence psychiatrist (male, course) helps restore order put things proper place. The cast little film playing stereotypes; fine actor like Shiney Ahuja reduced either bland acceptance frothing rage, Amisha Patel weeps moans throughout shrill voice, Vidya Balan sunshine cheer, Asrani, Paresh Rawal, Manoj Joshi alternately rant rave busy trying look scared. Akshay Kumar best, sudden shift script comic darkly tragic, pulls stuffing performance. Vineeth chosen non-consequential role, terpsichorean prowess. Rajpal Yadav total waste, fault, screen time runs five minutes so. Sabu Cyril’s art direction adequate, though overdoes bit crowd scenes peoples frame many holy men. The songs distraction come way script seeking build maintain psychological tension. The climax worthwhile, unfortunately emphasis comedy earlier part film, completely ruins it. The director could reined set bleak ominous approach would made film taut so, possibly ‘comic’ expectations audience him. One wonders whether one would ever get see realistic cinema mainstream Bollywood; even themes realistic, execution reduces crude buffoonery stylized gore fest. One waits day.
