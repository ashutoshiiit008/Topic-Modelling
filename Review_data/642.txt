The biggest fallout something terribly mediocre well spawns whole generation mediocrity based theme, aim cashing mania. The Twilight franchise, then, torchbearer teen romances dolled monsters and/or fantastical adventure settings. So Twilight led another franchise Hunger Games (which, I must admit, guilty fun) second film way, recent Stephenie Meyer adaptation, The Host. The latest follow trend The Mortal Instruments: City Bones – first film adaptation set books Cassandra Clare. So exhaustingly inane utterly ridiculous film I walked out, I couldn’t believe I little two hours. Now, I’m scared many books left series. This first film hasn’t even time enough gather brickbats, sequel already underway. Clary typical teenager typical teenage problems – thinks. Clary geeky best friend Simon get drawn world werewolves vampires magical portals; world even Bach supposedly Shadowhunter wrote music could tell demon apart reaction – no, I’m making up. Packed much exposition, explanation, back-story mythology, clichés rival equal measure - film cumbersome watch. It never eases levels idiocy inevitably keeps crossing. I haven’t read source material, I don’t know; seems like lot direction original novel. Harald Zwart, director Agent Cody Banks Jaden Smith’s The Karate Kid, directs film seems like alarming intent ensure never separates typical teen movies I mentioned earlier. This kind film begins raining indoors middle kiss. It is, course, conveniently attributed something else later, point clearly kiss rain. The film also keeps giving Harry Potter-Constantine déjà vu, isn’t necessarily good thing. Apart never able shake been-there-seen-that feel, film doesn’t seem original word screenplay. The film interestingly executed VFX pieces, that’s opposite nitpicking – I left determinedly hunting anything take away film. With generous display hooded skeleton-shaped gargoyles statues camera continuously seems want establish setting every new scene, film tries hard create sense foreboding danger - I admit happen while. However, anything good achieved comes undone next familiar fantasy-teen-romance-trope next annoying back-story-exposition film takes through. It doesn’t help performances film mundane be. Even known faces, Lena Headey Jonathan Rhys Meyers amongst others, left roles often make wonder kept straight face it. The young trio left task carrying film give all, there’s much one everything else around film. The film draining wearisome, every time spot Mortal Cup everyone’s running after, wish strong wine go with; downing cup would make film infinitely tolerable.
