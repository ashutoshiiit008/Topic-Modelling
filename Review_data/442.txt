Yes, nearly 20 years last episode – Indiana Jones Last Crusade Indy went search Holy Grail along father Henry Jones senior, Indy back! The trademark battered fedora present bull whip Indy played Harrison Ford older, battered, seemingly reasonable physical condition. Spielberg must wondered script film, coming nearly twenty years last Indy film twenty seven years Raiders Lost Ark, film made Indiana Jones cult hero pop culture. In interim, innumerable blockbuster action adventures made way onto screens world over. When Raiders Lost Ark released 1981 signaled birth monster blockbuster practically set trend swashbuckling action adventures. Post that, films varied Romancing Stone King Solomon’s Mines recent execrable National Treasure, owe existence Raiders. So latest Indy film offer? Unfortunately, offers elements first one – elaborate action set pieces – three all, including one opening film, dry banter lead characters, plot involves archaeological hocus pocus accent paranormal. I used word unfortunately, done Spielberg nothing new offer viewer either terms style content. So mouldy caves rotting mummies, flesh eating ants, mysterious riddles written long forgotten languages, exotic locales – Amazon case, forget search absolutely super duper mysterious artifact. While enemies earlier films (Raiders Holy Grail) Nazis, film situated 1957, Russians playing evil ones height Cold War, Cate Blanchett Rosa Klebb type character (remember From Russia Love) super pseudo Russian accent creased military pants. Spielberg stuck comic book feel earlier Indy films, set pieces quite standard. True form, two set pieces involve motor vehicle chases, Indiana Jones leaping moving vehicles Shia LeBeouf indulging Douglas Fairbanks style swordplay. Spielberg throw occasional surprise, sequence Indy stumbles onto nuclear testing site. The sequence motorcycle chase ends library also pretty good. I missed Sean Connery witty comments; get banter Harrison Ford Shia LeBeouf, part quite flat. The climax CGI generated, quite tame. Yes, I felt nostalgic watching film thinking years gone by, film likely fans Indiana Jones. For viewer seen Indy film I would highly recommend viewing Raiders Lost Ark Indiana Jones Last Crusade, could safely give one miss!
