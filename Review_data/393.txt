It great learn something didn't know film. It great learn scientist tried get plane fly people know – Wright Brothers. It also awesome know secret written ancient scriptures. Whether true sound grounds matter debate beyond scope review. In either case, matters nationality scientist belonged matter religion scriptures originated from. (Can text books belong religion anyway?) Was India even one nation text written? But, point Hawaizaada seems say, “we first, first!” Not mention film says 2.5 hours. Hawaizaada might passed sweet story shorter. A one-line plot summary would “A man wanted build airplane.” And alludes freedom struggle, family dynamics, romance etc, film despite one point focus place. The romantic moments patriotic ones make go, “Huh? Where come from?” The emotions display strong compared mild build-up. The background music sets way theatric make take anything film seriously. The film bright sharp us believe 19th century. Sure, films blame make us believe rustic times. But, distracting sure makes feel watching play rather film. The language seems little contemporary. At times times director attempts childish comedy garb Chaplin-esque. Ayushman Khurana charm getting old now. Also, rare male actor cry well screen, one them. Mithun Chakraborty carries eccentricity well, asked him. But uneven – asking, doing. Pallavi Sharda's existence film makes not-so brave film. If idea make film concept Indian made first plane fly appealing need lady prop? That shows lack conviction. With audience eager lap film novel concepts, worth trying one without making musical. Another hint film tries appeal populist sentiment Ayushman Khurana speak Marathi. Authenticity would wrong argument make one character Shivi speaks Marathi, including parents. It's like continuously speaks Marathi either. So, first man fly plane Indian, spoke Marathi too! It would really sad move break actor's North Indian boy image. Yet, I look forward next film, chooses films norm. And thing works Hawaizaada - something different attempted. Despite pitfalls, Hawaizaada attempts telling story carefree, wayward, rich, spoilt brat also smart sharp interests him. And went fly plane. Patriotism national pride aside.
