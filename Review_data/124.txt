There two kinds ‘predictability’ come across you’re watching film. The first, commonly occurring type, absolutely know story headed, writer director imagination scripting making film; ‘yawn’ kind predictability. The second, rare, particularly films, characters well etched really step person would taken faced particular situation. It doesn’t jar; feels, want better word, natural. I pleasantly surprised, then, Anjali Menon’s Bangalore Days lot second kind predictability. Now look run-time film - shade 3 hours – wonder film young people inference, targeted primarily young people, would long. (We’ve reached stage many kind attention span, films hover around 2 – 2.5 hour mark.) The answer, again, lies characterization. The characters given room breathe, explore discover themselves. Bangalore Days, thus, surprised multiple levels. The three main characters, Arjun, Divya Krishnan (fondly called Kuttetan), cousins. Extremely close growing Kerala, always promised they’d go Bangalore older. As turns out, life takes exactly there; journey something truly worth sharing. Handled surprising amount patience maturity, get involved stories equally. Newly-married Divya’s problems reticent husband – fourth important character film; Kuttetan’s yearning simple, Malayali girl who’ll make happy; nomad Arjun’s journey towards internal stability; tales could story itself. Put together, though, makes soul-stirring ride. Because characters written well, relationships also crafted love. They stand other, fight, make pull along beautifully. Yes, film share ‘twists’ seem tad place. But one way look find primary characters deal them. So eventually make twists work fact tie lives characters beautifully. The film also little moments, little deft touches add wonderful texture story. I don’t want give anything away, little moments show lot thought went putting film paper. Insight human behaviour relationships, love little flourishes life, genuine fondness affection characters written. Yes, moments would classified ‘filmy’; one origin – writer-director’s heart. The icing, then, cast. Cute-as-a-button Nazriya Divya charms you. The fact husband, known film Das, played wonderfully talented real life fiancé Fahadh Faasil, gives story added zing. Nivin Pauly Kuttetan sweet, bumbling presence. And young Dulquer Salman, plays Arjun, star. The screen presence confidence genes, course, he’s also solid actor – talent cannot taken granted even father Mammootty. Bangalore Days one honest films I’ve seen while. The effort put film manifests ways can’t strictly quantified. The film well shot well, really nice music. Bangalore, city I personally love, also beautifully captured film. It seems long since we’ve met characters fall love walk fall love themselves. Bangalore Days offers that.
