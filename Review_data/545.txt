"Hell hath fury like woman scorned." But woman woman all. These two lines likely read every review Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl. A woman warm compassionate wrong her, capable making life hell. But, turn back warm compassionate self slightest chance. While over-generalization course Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl guilty charged, I slightly charmed three women representing three facets today's woman - strength man's world; old-school simplicity; superficial & so? - fourth woman combines three. Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl started making way good books writer spent time thinking women. But, spark. And no, spark doesn't mean adding absolutely irrelevant songs bump stories. The strategy might worked Yash Raj Films earlier. But music worth listening choreography colors worth shaken film. It's shame throughout first half, I wondering better known faces three women - Dimple, Raina Saira - would engaged better. I thinking non-top actresses could've added spunk three women's decent performances. They acted well, something plain stories came across. It kept bothering stories interesting, actors apt yet weren't able engage me. The mostly basic dialogue blame. Except lines given Parineeti Chopra, funny completely in-character, others pretty much functional. Parineeti Chopra adds value comic timing. Also, extra credit Aditi Sharma Dipannita Sharma done well dialogue had. There lot going body language emotive eyes convey written. And yet, I can't shake feeling maybe supporting actors say Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na Wake Up! Sid would added spirit missing. Interestingly, Ranveer Singh Anoushka Sharma nothing new, except maybe show calendar-photo bodies off. I guess, one complain, nothing major really expected them. Of course, two major characters film that, don't come feeling special film. In fact, I hear twosome utter word " partner" more, I might mark film, lack originality. However, "different" thoughts film. I don't use word "original" I'm sure someone somewhere done before. But, sly comments commercialism hypocrisy brought casually - comment don't Rs.30 wine Rs.30,000 wine willing gulp down, packaged 5-star environment. Unfortunately, along usual problem goes "con" film. Everything works easily climax usually cop-out. Add predictability, ask whether conned thinking woman's film?
