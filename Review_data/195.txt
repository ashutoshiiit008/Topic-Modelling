"Houston, problem" A huge problem. We losing Ranvir Shorey big, bad world and...fast.Ranvir 'Chopstick' who's Feng Shastra specialist, sells good luck amulets too. He'll anything every penny get daily bread. But, he's entirely heartless. Looks like nice gray character Ranvir full justice to, right? Uhh...Friendly reminder: heart-throb "masses", Akshay Kumar playing simpleton, village chowk fool, movie too. By definition, entire cast HAS speak least 20 decibel levels acceptable. And therein lies problem. Ranvir, convey much eyes, let alone body language, made look like comic filler found every slapstick. I guess slapstick role entertainment. But, can't something fresh, something makes roll floor laughing, literally. Sure, lines scattered around witty bring smile. But every element 'masala' entertainer like punctuation next element. It' like scriptwriter/director went -Oye! 19 minutes since emotional scene. Time one. Plug in. OR/AND Oh no! actors much glycerin, can't audience crying long. Where's crotch joke played 5 minutes ago? Will perfect here. AND/OR Oopsie-doopsie-poopsie...haven't action sequence while. Editor dear, let's put one in, right lovey-dovey song. So forth... There would've miniscule amount grace elements worked least themselves. But, na-ah. A smile here, smile there. A good laugh hard slap forehead pointless predictability all.True, action sequences ensuing computer gimmickry ght. A couple 'wows' Deepika Padukone's karate hu-aa. But that's absolute terms. Relatively, evening Matrix's Trinity Kung Fu Panda might give better dose action, comedy cuteness! There's something Deepika doesn't seem right. She looks alright, nothing overly charming beautiful. But 'the girl next door' either. She's completely blank still going motions. Who I kidding? There really character(s) whose skin could let talent(?) grow show. Yeah, yeah, yeah...time give credit it's due. Yep! There couple things I liked. Akshay Kumar's character, Sidhu extremely consistent. There's point event moment inspired grow brains. The way character grew gradually didn't seem place sudden. Like Nikhil Advani's earlier venture Salaam-e-ishq, I found tiny spoof-type sub-plots interesting. There infomercials pop every while. A comment blind faith made passing. I'm curious issues make way absolute crazy caper. Anyway little, late. This completely lost pure non-sense plot, script, screenplay are. Yep, right! What could I expected!?
