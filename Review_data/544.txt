So, Yash Raj movie. You learnt forgive extra tinge orange sharp sounds, mandatory songs unnecessary melodrama. But, throughout movie, one question nags is, "Could real person, seriously react way situation?" exactly expected enjoy? We talking movie claims 'journey woman'. I refuse believe supposed leave-your-brain-home-and-don't-ask-too-many-questions genre. What could celebration spirit woman, turns another story woman finding ultimate happiness meeting ideal man. It uncanny salute womanhood ends men goal lives. Not mention men shown breed crave sex. So desperate pay huge sums sex remorseful, uninterested women. Let alone societal issues, treatment given story also half-hearted. The details missing. Elements needed build-up happened suddenly. The outcome things built-up movie resolved within 30 seconds screen time. The redeeming factors performances two leading ladies - Rani Mukherjee Konkona Sen Sharma. We seen women wide variety roles, particular ones don't stand within standards set themselves. But, managed jerk tears without adequate support script dialogues praiseworthy. The dialogues, especially towards end clich√©d outright ridiculous. There one pause Abhishek Bachchan takes mid-sentence. You could sense huge portion audience admire dialogue-predicting capabilities, finishes line. The dialogues excessive couple scenes given Konkana. I think, left devices, Konkana could expressed much silences. On hand, I bowled lyrics songs. Especially, "nistabdh khadi hu mein" "Kachi kaliyaa". The music refreshing different. Now, whether songs deserved time screen different question altogether. The camerawork average. No in-the-face camera annoying movements except scenes there. In fact, couple well-done scenes depicting emotional state character. Unfortunately, go rest film technique continue rest movie. What amused huge compliment cameraperson paid Abhishek Bachchan Rani Mukherjee song supposedly shot Switzerland. Just imagine, scenic beauty world capture focused mainly close mid-shots two-some. Or avoid criticized favoring Alps much? Or could Switzerland all? The rainbow shot towards end song looked like use blue screen. If wasn't, that's bigger shame, isn't it? Imagine money spent effect blue screen. Better defined characters even better defined motivations would taken overall interesting plot long way. But, alas, lot ask for.
