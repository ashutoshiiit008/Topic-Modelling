It's lengthy, it's slow it's preachy. And yet it's engaging. It's don't lose patience every while, there's enough savor screen. And that, soon enough, interesting remark made story moves bit forward right direction. A Muslim protagonist, common man, auto-garage owner, part local community association - Hasmat bhai (Paresh Rawal) finds struggling always believed religion he's told religion is. He believes work religion, keeping commitments highest priority - qualities long lost contemporary India. After much internal debate follows conscience. If thoughtfulness sincerity thought put marks film average must watch, theater, least DVD. Even topic doesn't interest you, might want catch Road Sangam experience freshness Paresh Rawal's ultra-serious performance. A non-caricature, non over-the-top role gem non-rare isn't. Unfortunately can't said about, performances. While Om Puri looks rather stiff, Maulana twitching beard talking weird tone pitch rather amusing. Also, talent went writing Hasmat's character absolutely missing characterizations. They rather feeble except one-odd case transformed without much convincing.

The entire 2.5 hours length Road Sangam plays intelligent drawing room argument. The pace follows life-style non-metro gives time mull. Mull issues like partition India Pakistan actually partition Muslims. It toys around what-ifs remarks like savings defense expenditure partition avoided. That done, need hour today? Another Gandhi see Hasmat reincarnated Bapu himself, latter's ashes pour holy waters. And Hasmat common man like - I need go satyagrah fellow-citizens see really need - peace. Road Sangam one community. What fundamenatalists religion(s)?
