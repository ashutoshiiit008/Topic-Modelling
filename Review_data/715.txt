I don't remember last time I walked theater felt like I've left different world behind. Not world I want go back time soon, that's quality I saw there, it's shocked fright insides felt. It might accentuated somewhere, deep I expecting watch unintentional comedy. To credit absolutely justified. But one turned chiller. So, zero-thought story. Oh, way, film directed Ram Gopal Varma. Just saying. Phoonk 2 creates lot shrieks, loud audience, least jerk shudder every while. And basis camerawork, sound design (though almost always, it's louder side), make-up taking suspense almost intolerable high. Though large chunk first half, thrill peaks got annoying. Later, get used movie moves forward inch inch get sucked drama. The writing, characterisations, worse - continuity way beyond comprehension. The first half used establish characters scared last nerve unknown sense something spooky rounds. The second half characters either getting beaten killed brutally unknown. Yes, scares you. Not care protagonist family. But unknown creates completely suffocating environment. And maybe film's success. But way many things left loose. And I'm complaining stuff remains unexplained. I didn't let 'why's bother me. For example, I forcefully ignored omnipresent, evil spirit's graciousness allowing characters mourn dead longest time. It's 'how's became distracting. Like, said unknown scary unknown, said powers place twice? There jerks continuity like day turning night vice versa logical flow. And I'm one didn't problem dark climax. In fact, Harry Potterish. Of course, movie wouldn't half impact performances mark. Except overacting exorcists, rest cast decent enough job getting scared thus scaring us. A lot worked film make-up department cinematographer awesome job. Phoonk 2 'job get done' mode started. That turned cynicism, first half hour, every scene moved slowly music reaching climax every five minutes. And absolutely unexpectedly, started creating jitters. And kind anxiety doesn't give kick, horror far least-liked genre. Even so, usually super-natural horror stories don't scare easily. This one did. I wanted spirit go away, level I could identify family causing agony to. If really like kind horror, could go it. I doubt DVD watch justice cinematography. If like me, getting terrorized - dead alive - idea cinema, IPL still on, sports channels news channels too!
