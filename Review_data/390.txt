There couldn’t generic story line. Replace cricket obsession two cricket-crazy characters movie would – awful. I assume movie named hattrick “three” story lines connection cricket. There three threads movie - Kunal Kapoor-Rimi Sen; Nana Patekar-Danny Denzongpa; Paresh Rawal family. So far good. Kunal huge cricket fan – lame OK. Danny Denzongpa bowler turned coach. OK. Paresh Rawal – I think happened – writer wrote Paresh Rawal’s story; dozed struggling inject cricket connection blank spaces (I wonder why); woke find crossed deadline submitting it; submitted had. Because writer late, others time read started making movie is. I think connection movie cricket number advertisements squeezed – Reebok, Café Coffee Day, Starbucks, Tootsies, Kellogg’s, Fedex (and I sure I missed some). If enough annoy you, usual extra-bright blues, pinks oranges associate movie qualms taking cinematic liberties. Connection three threads? Goodness, guys limits expectations! They give three stories (?) instead one want connect?!? Nana Patekar, Paresh Rawal, Danny Denzongpa script asked therefore complaints them, except taking roles first place. Then Kunal Kapoor interested drooling muscular physique Rimi Sen (with overdose make-up) interested looking sexy seducing women. They serve purpose well tough competition who’s-going-to-show-more-skin competition? Their performances mostly loud. Speaking loud, first time ever, I wanted remote fast forward songs. Okay-okay, enough negativity. The good thing is, I laughed loud thrice movie smiled once, 3.5 laughs less two hours. Hey, wow! A hattrick little more. The dialogues were…oops, can’t remember…well, let’s say forgettable - especially preachy ones end. Since I can’t seem control cynical attitude already used gray matter write review makers used make movie, I shall take leave next time.
