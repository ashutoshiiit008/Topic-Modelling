Ra.One's first-day-first-show reviewed wogma's guest reviewer Pradeep Menon here. Thank much, Pradeep wogma. I Diwali family saw film couple days later. Here's I liked Ra.One. * Ra.One works brilliant film kids. And I say sarcasm all. From time I heard premise film, gave children's film vibe. Of course, fear alienating audience, Ra.One couldn't marketed kids film. But, day age nice "cool" enough, Ra.One goes show happens try mess "good > evil" formula. Or like Pradeep said, "it tries". It attempt moral story functional, shallow. When woman loves husband, grieves perfunctorily, using two-minute song medium AND ready look shiny hot next party number, barely care character died. As adult, I wonder, whether right lesson morals all. But child, one could forgiving focus job hand - kill villain cheer up. The movie-lover takes lack warmth stride focuses film made entertainment allows dark event like death happen. That slick action swift enough pace I didn't get bored two-and-a-half-hour film fifteen-minute ad-filled interval. That huge plus wants every minute beyond 100-105 minute mark count. While action executed team obviously best field, writing mediocre - dialogue overall story. The film tries hard funny, almost "one-liners" fall flat. The non-funny, supposedly emotional/inspirational lines "bleh". The line stayed powerful statement said Ra.One villain, also heard promos. And I wish I that, also Ra.One, character. I supposed fear protagonist feared him, anything menacing him. And I can't blame actor, Arjun Rampal, story didn't sub-plots events exposed anything loathsome him. I need something powerful, I'm supposed hate software program, right? It could also thing threat little boy's life. It isn't earth destroyed aliens world peace stake. And isn't anything extra endearing little boy gorgeous mother Kareena Kapoor feel fear behalf. Instead, get mumbo-jumbo name game really works? We villain power take control others' mind, writers couldn't think intense situations us see power. There one scene Kareena Kapoor, comes across device give screen time different expression, anything else. The climax lame, leaves interesting premise sequel, course, need out-of-this-world writing make good use it. The one thing comes pleasant surprise didn't happen Shah Rukh Khan doesn't fill every frame. Also, doesn't ham go Shah Rukkkkhy us, though loses Tamil accent way often. There one scene character Shekhar scared wits, I forgot he's The SRK, I taken Shekhar's fear confusion what's happening - absolutely un-hero like, certainly non-star like. There little elements make film likeable. There isn't much take home, 2.5 hours spent theater bad. There sequences film made miss kids. I know one laugh loud, clench hand fear. Yes there's lot juvenile humor I'm giving kids two years snap of. I'm surely going test hypothesis out, I choice, want watch movie, I've make promise, "Even don't like it, mamma" :D I'll surely update space interesting observations. Till then, Happy Diwali you. And again, thank Pradeep wogma review day 1.
