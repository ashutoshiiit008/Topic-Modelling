Hindi war films rarity. Well-made ones even so. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore welcome change that. To top more-or-less two man act yet, manages engage 100-minute run-time. Both sides dusty, rugged section India-Pakistan border find one soldier each. Interestingly, soldiers belonged side partition. It easy understand allegiance confused. You empathize put situation all. You, fact, find changing sides seem like protagonists could take either side film moves one mini-event another. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore doesn't move much. Not physical space time (it set period 24 hours), also terms actually happens film. The movement emotions rather events. This gives film fluidity feels different episodic nature many Hindi film. Given circumstances, film run risk becoming repetitive. After all, many ways Indian Pakistani (even newly so) sling mud other. Unfortunately, Kya Dilli Kya Lahore fall prey that. But, pace gets soon enough. Also, characters go back forth emotions believable could easily gotten iterative, brilliant performances Vijay Raaz Manu Rishi. From word go act seems effortless natural take granted. I caught thinking performance I deliberately focused it. Till immediately given. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore well-shot, also almost background score less - rarity Hindi cinema. With frog croaks sound wind background many times, songs blare (most likely break monotony) jarring. Other that, film brings vanity war impact macro level decisions made politicians common man soldier well - tinge dark comedy too. It could called cliché too, every cliché works. The last Hindi war film saw was, War Chhod Na Yaar well, good. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore well-intentioned well made too. Certainly worth 100 minutes.
