Easily poetic haunting film I’ve watched big screen long time, (Anand Gandhi’s Ship Theseus comes close second,) Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master extraordinarily melancholic layered film seems many things, nothing all, once. But film, Paul Thomas Anderson underlines fact one daringly original thinkers American cinema produced, ever. Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix, terrific return) broken man, World War II seaman trying deal life post-war world. He sexually frustrated, almost always high booze (that makes using commonplace ingredients finds hand), perhaps looking direction life. He seems find direction words teachings Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman, beautifully nuanced), founder philosophical stream thought known ‘The Cause’. The core film mysterious relationship two polar opposites Freddie Dodd (called ‘Master’ followers) represent. Freddie wayward, eccentric, filled nervous energy constantly looking outlet, better yet, form control. Dodd, hand, seems always control most. Freddie is, many ways, looking meaning life, something bow to, like master. Dodd provides extent, always seems something missing, something can’t quite place. As film strips away lays bare characters Freddie Dodd, also hides much shows, inviting deeper it, draw meaning. Like Freddie’s actions often draw smirks even laughs, pause think it, weight loneliness frustrations behind actions should, anything, make one cry. Of course, pre-release, one film’s talked-about aspects fact character Lancaster Dodd based Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The parallels The Cause Scientology clear; Anderson makes attempt mask it. So past-life regression healing powers Dodd attributes it, belief man cure ailments current life delving previous lives curing there, albeit mentally – many there. However, anyone expecting find mystery behind makes many millions around world follow Scientology religion bound disappointed. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance Freddie one gut-wrenching portrayals character recent times. Perhaps Daniel Day Lewis deserve Best Actor Oscar performance Lincoln, may say man added benefit prosthetics well historical reference points help ‘feel’ like 16th President United State. But Joaquin Phoenix inhabits Freddie kind body language state mind reference point, alone, must lauded. Philip Seymour Hoffman excellent Lancaster Dodd. A Paul Thomas Anderson staple, filmography Anderson alone shows remarkable range Hoffman has. It tough even imagine guy played Scotty Boogie Nights played Lancaster Dodd The Master. Mihai Mălaimare Jr’s gorgeous cinematography Johnny Greenwood’s sparsely arranged no-less haunting music embellish sense loneliness endless hunt meaning film essentially is. Also, pity don’t get 70mm release film India. The kind detail every 70mm frame would hold would perhaps give little insight Anderson trying say every shot. Paul Thomas Anderson absolute master taking basest human characteristics weaving near-epic films them. He also particularly skilled making film feel like lighter – speak – actually is. But The Master, goes esoteric ever done before; asks viewer viewers used giving film. Though many disagree, I long held view truly great cinema appreciated repeated viewings. Anyone calls, example, The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, great films watching absolutely idea films great; watched repeatedly see true cinematic greatness is. Which The Master kind film polarized opinions. There either reject film first viewing, wondering big deal about, feel like continuously revisiting it, attempting draw meaning subsequent viewing, reading watching again. They continuously question Dodd’s intentions were, came Freddy. Or when, exactly, Dodd Freddie first meet? Or hint homoeroticism spotted relationship Dodd Freddie? Or Dodd’s exact intentions The Cause itself? And what, really, film even mean? If looking it, film always gives feeling you’ve missed something. Likely then, ask Anderson film about, he’ll probably say, “Secrets.”
