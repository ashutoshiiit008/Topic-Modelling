Love conquers all. Or it? Whether not, care? At least R...Rajkumar doesn't make you. It makes feel love romance means meet end making action film Shahid Kapoor star. Shahid Kapoor make though. His comic timing required film nature decent, best emote anger, fatigue, worry rest too. Unfortunately, comic lines either over-writtent sound way "filmy" inane. Similarly, Sonakshi Sinha lands another role requires play second fiddle male lead. Though introduciton screen fight sequence makes believe one might meat her. You see glimpses variety do, little certainly disheartening saw Lootera. Yes, I know, I still stuck there. That aside, Sonu Sood lot brawn. It's interesting R...Rajkumar, film clearly wants hit masala film lover you, villain better looking lead pair put together. Considering I spent three paragraphs actors, safe assume little talk departments. The writing least all. It certainly didn't material stretched screenplay 2.5 hours. I must say though, flat unimaginatively predictable overall plot manage bring unanticipated turn events. But worry, goes back expected five minutes. There lot action packed too. Some even little innovative beginning. But, purpose masked killings random stay amused much. Add slo-mo close-ups tuned off. Of course, means cinematography dramatic background music loud associated film genre. That leaves music department, well, might foot-tapping material, lyrics outright awful. And somehow awful lyrics almost always translate sleazy dances women. Yet, I wouldn't like take away anything heart Shahid Kapoor puts dances. The choreography mind-bogglingly complicated, Prabhu Deva film. Also, become repetitive eventually dry up. Not mention, usual, nothing graceful dances set him. In sense then, R...Rajkumar exactly expected be. If Prabhu Deva film, film aspires entertain masala. And yet, house full, equally enthusiastic whistles hooting Shahid Kapoor, Sonakshi Sonu Sood. Correct, I don't understand world.
