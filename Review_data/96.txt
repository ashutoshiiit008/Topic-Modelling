The quality animation Walt Disney logo video (producer), despite repeated views, gets hopes animation film coming up. And course, disappointed first scene. But, won't surprising money spent logo video close spent whole Arjun: The Warrior Prince. Given that, I understand it's unfair expectation comparison. Even so, faces expressions animation far behind. The backdrops hand much detailed. Even patterns clothes jewelry pretty intricate. Even long shots, conceptualized really well, colors, formations war sequences aesthetic. Then, lack imagination facial expression department. 2-3 variations eyebrows, eyes lips move things see. Same goes body language movement - trees, water animals. All movements come across frames missing two gross movements. These things take away lot experience animated film. Sure, must function money available lot also comes across lack talent. Another department animated films lack voice animation. That doesn't much variation thus distracts story told. Mahabharat, war - events encompasses, many characters complex relationships - humungous enough movie cover entirety. We know, events leading war far beyond single session story-telling. So, indeed unfair expect 100-minute cover all. And thankfully, Arjun: The Warrior Prince doesn't attempt either. It clearly conveys intends tell much rest either looked outside film indicates part 2 coming up. However, seeing war Kurukshetra epilogue text hilarious. Like one would expect, assumed know central characters earlier on. While I'm glad characters explicitly introduced, abrupt way characters brought picture rather disconcerting. As time spent thinking character blend story, case example, Bhishma Pitamah. Then come liberties taken great epic. While acceptable input maker like tall Gandhari accompanying short, blind Dhrithrashtra short stout Shakuni (who tall Gandhari's brother). But others no-no. For example, way chakravyuha formation soldiers shown - didn't look like maze all! Not mention use Virat war Arjun Abhimanyu together questionable. And changes story, wanting narrate story know. For film titled Arjun: The Warrior Prince, I'd expect lot Arjun's point view. They try, still feels like episodes one might heard grandparent bedtime story. There isn't much insight that. Arjun: The Warrior Prince works much comic strip book would. Except much intricate backdrops sans speech/thought bubbles.
