Watching tiny little girl reach glee bubbles heading towards joy special enough. But happens inside darkened cinema hall tiny little girl wearing 3-D glasses, feeling quite simply something else. George Miller’s Happy Feet 2, sequel Academy Award-winning Happy Feet (also directed Miller) fun children’s film immensely helped 3-D. In fact, since Avatar 3-D contributed much film. At last, someone seems realized don’t get feeling characters action right front you, really isn’t point releasing film 3-D. Apart thoroughly enjoyable 3-D experience, film quite easily stolen Brad Pitt Matt Damon-voiced characters Bill Krill Will Krill. Though aren’t central characters film, interwoven portions featuring two Krill ‘swim swarm’ genuinely funny, quirky enjoyable animation. Their antics often reminiscent legendary Scrat Ice Age series. The dialogue film goofy witty, particularly portions involving Bill Will. You can’t help smile Will rattles dancing providing ‘momentary relief existential terrors existence’. However, film majorly let central story Mumble Penguin (voiced Elijah Wood) family. Not nearly charming first film, Happy Feet 2 tries pack much little time, ultimately making seem like mishmash number animation films come Hollywood. While host endearing characters including Ramon, voiced excellently Robin Williams Sven, voiced Hank Azaria, plot film doesn’t engage enough root central characters. Like first film, musical, couple well-crafted musical set pieces fun last. At core film father-son story feels quite unexplored. The film would appealed far core idea used anchor film, instead whole host sub-plots deviate potential heart-warming tale son grows respect father man (or penguin) is. What really works film packs many messages tries hard convey messages. Thus, audience repeatedly subjected characters coming terms accepting are, importance family, environmental messages on. No surprise film ends becoming tad preachy good. Ultimately, film fun watch children 3-D genuinely thrilling, one wishes makers film chosen narrate simpler, cleaner tale would genuinely ‘brought happy’.
