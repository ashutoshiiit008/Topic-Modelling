Don't let video promotional song put off. This brave directorial debut certainly cheesily picturized. I willing take bet said video made completely different set people - marketing MBAs likelihood. People, reason think bright colors half-naked women thing get us theater. Originality executed even reasonably well hard come by, spot one mile, deserves enthusiastic support. The freshness lies way vaguely familiar stories sewn together. The clever dialogues giving company along. The way complex plot unfolds transitions one sub-plot another without taxing brains viewer enticing. Sitting edge seat gives backache, otherwise I would it. And feel, "okay, one sub-plot might make whole thing go over-board", movie ends. The writer balance right. So, bonus marks guts takes something like this. Of course, perfect product hard come too. So things amiss. The one strikes lead pair's performance. They completely off, don't whole range either - expressions, body language, voice modulation. And nags end. The supporting cast though, barring shrieking vamp, gives creditworthy support. I also issues unnecessarily tilted camera angle over-used verge nausea first half. Throughout movie though, little things kept splits. Sound effects used exaggerate going-ons took cake. Creative slapstick welcome, especially dosage really low. Similarly, background music absolutely complemented pace movie. Particularly, car chases Pulp-Fiction-inspired strings play - apt tribute. In fact, lot "style" looks like inspired/derived Pulp Fiction. The creativity humor infused story brilliant. Alas, largish measure dark comedy neither provoked tickled. It existed thus watched. Thus, comedy works, works really well appalling it's crude. Interestingly, pace much like riding Mumbai local train. Takes slowly, gathers momentum, goes top speed stays till destination arrives slows short credits start rolling. If symbolism intentional, I thoroughly enjoyed tongue-in-cheek humor. But, worth risk - thriller start land sluggish pace? A good 10 minutes first half hour another 5 minutes last 15-20 minutes could edited out. If symbolism fabrication imagination - oh well, I deserve points coming analogy!
