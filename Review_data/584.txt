I imagine Zoya Akhtar taking notes every time saw person industry behave "typical" industry manner. She smoothened edges rough mental sketches, deepened ever-so-slightly, gave thick outline ta-da...script ready. That's Einstein-moment realized needed story. Damn! Back storyboard weave characters together coherent plot. If left her, she'd happy continue playing around characters peculiarities couple hours without ever getting story. And she'd done well too. That's say didn't justice story, it's nothing spectacular - love story gray characters ambitious. And tweak simple storyline bit too. And tweaks might make movie popular I enjoyed best. The foreground Mumbai's filmy world clich√©d elements movie based industry could expected have. And yet there's charm characters. Rishi Kapoor industry stalwart yet share insecurities. Dimple Kapadia, Diva era hasn't enough fame intent upon continuing live aspirations daughter. Isha playing daughter almost clueless knows way around too. Juhi Chawla's character enjoys status world even mostly name trophy-wife. All "stars" real life mixed Manish Malhotra, Mac Mohan, Javed Akhtar, Shabana Azmi, Kareena Kapoor, Vivek Oberoi, Ranbir Kapoor, John Abraham, Abhishek Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan Aamir Khan playing themselves. Anurag Kashyap aces list, I couldn't resist giggling throughout two scenes. Don't let list bring back bad memories Om Shanti Om though. Even cameos multiply glamour quotient, there's reason smartly woven movie it's shake leg two. This smartness runs undercurrent movie. It starts one non-Khans 'top' industry, Hrithik Roshan named Zaffar Khan. Then see discussing break mould set actor...so work Karan Johar. Farhan Akhtar's character, Vikram written great thought too. The transitions goes perfunctory result inspirational one-liner. But, see build-up towards change. We see get vulnerable-emotional conniving-calculative. The credit goes much growing talent actor goes way character written. On hand, I feel little bad Konkona Sen Sharma. Since almost always picks well-written roles, one seems like yet-another-well-written character. So even though performs well gets nuances across feels like 'What's big deal? We know that.' Yet medley little good things stretches "got it, let's move already!" There spans absolutely inane-quotes-from-an-email-forward dialogues. I suppose meant inspire. But lines almost always end patronizing annoying sort-of way. The saving grace amidst witty one-liners. Luck By Chance kind sit back enjoy. And time keeps gray cells work. Not powerful plot thing. But characters thinking talk like people do. So chance, miss theaters make sure catch DVD...only officially though ;)
