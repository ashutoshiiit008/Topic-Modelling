The characters things abruptly, story leaps one point next without giving audience clue. It reads like chapters book chapter ending cliffhanger. However, start next chapter realize cliffhanger big deal all. I don’t want spoon-feeding, hint transitions characters relationships making would give narrative much needed flow. Soha Ali Khan, Shiney Ahuja, Rajat Kapoor, Vinay Pathak good actors. But, come across going motions. It claimed movie really story comment lifestyles people about. But, come across too, certain amount insight character necessary. Khoya Khoya Chandrevolves around Nikhat relationships. But time figured out, lost interest. Mainly screenplay meanders around trying show everyone's point view. I usually enjoy movies/stories narrated various points view, one view fully fleshed out. Even Nikhat's character doesn't seem completely thought out. Isn't shame spending two hours Nikhat clue feels characters movie? Or is? Clueless relationships? Either way, couldn’t care less. The chops one scene also distracting. Before sink teeth character trying say/do/feel led straight next episode. I rarely question person falls love another person. You know - "love happens". But, blindly accepted that, I think I deserve peep couple spends time together grow apart. Nope, luck. I told, way plain dialogue glycerin-filled eyes transpired last scene. Khoya Khoya Chand also emptiness lives people, specifically people work film industry. It also shows fallibility "stars" people portrayed larger life reel-life. The irony staring face. Uh...so what? We know that. Our "star" played oh-so-lovable Munnabhai prison involved terrorists goodness sake! However, I'd like thank director taking us charming 50s-60s. (Except title song - best, seems little modern compared setting rest movie.) Especially songs - music, lyrics, presentation. The music lyrics truly refreshing. Yet, I saw specific reason set 50s. It might well present-day story. True, tributes various actors, directors, music directors era. And certainly must I missed I completely aware happening personal lives people era. Any way, I found lives portrayed one-dimensional, ordinary. And technical aspects extraordinarily bizarre. The light seemed coming weirdest places gave many scenes artificial look. There way many close-ups almost on-location sets. It made feel like I trapped low-budget Bhansali-land. And camera wasn't closing faces, going around circles particular reason. More so, towards end movie. Put together, didn't create impact all. And exact purpose time-transition title cards serving - "One month later", "two months later"? Were supposed imply whatever shown last title card happened one day? However, title cards end said loud clear, "this ran money, sorry - story finish. khel khatam, paisa hajam (money digested, game over). Tata. Good bye. Go home." Haven't seen abrupt ending recent past. As I write review, I running movie again. It's Sudhir Mishra product. There must larger point, hiding? Or maybe point show pointlessness existence. If so, doesn't interest me, one clearly me. Parental guidance: When good chance adults might get bored, I doubt children going sit it. Besides, story adult relationships. Visually couple mild love scenes.
