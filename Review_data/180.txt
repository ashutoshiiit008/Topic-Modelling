I target audience movie. Like many Indians, (as appropriately depicted movie) I run-a-minute person. So, game claims "exciting" final score 1-0, interests much. Top "Shah Rukh Khan over-rated" attitude. You know makers played cards right, person tastes hooked movie entire length. Though credit mainly goes sharp focused writing, casting needs special mention too. But wait... This Jaideep Sahni's movie way. The little unexpected things script make difference otherwise ordinary plot. In movie underdogs trying achieve impossible, pretty much know story going. It's "how" get counts CHAKDE! INDIA scores (all pun intended!) many levels. The obstacles characters encounter ride, overcome, keep glued enthusiasm till reach destination. And I really glad stuck hockey team whine much coach life. The rhythmic ups downs story supported equally well crisp, witty dialogues you-are-smart-viewers silences. The sub-episodes flow one another without episodic. That editors job well also demonstrated remark I overheard way movie, "The good thing Hindi movies days two hours. 9.30 11.30 - nice movie". The movie actually started 9. If movie felt 20% shorter was, editing department done job really well. Oh yeah, casting...the first thing sell ideology get popular actor board. But, went one step further. The whole team perfectly cast. From hockey team hockey association members - one singled fitting shoes character. It difficult say whether dialogues written first actors chosen first. Okay - I loved Shah Rukh Khan's acting! There - I said it. Done. (Believe - It wasn't remotely easy write read it.) The smirks conspicuous absence; occasional, unnecessarily long-paused sentence; romantic lines delivered half-whispers (thank goodness!); - get - trade-marked raising hands side waiting hug him. Best all, shared space girls without overshadowing them. No-no, it's things do. There things right too. He controlled emoting frustration, happiness, anger, disbelief. Actually made excuse occasional "I King" attitude (Ray Ban, et al)...ahem...okay...now I get divorce notice comment space here, let's wrap here. When entire audience rooting women's hockey team 150 minutes straight, know movie worked. The movie certainly achieved aim drawing attention national sport especially plight women sport. It invoked national spirit, made us whistle cheer, clap hard, laugh loud. It almost like stadium watching actual game. The question, now, - sensitized enough something situation? Meanwhile, like Shah Rukh's acting keep expectations control enjoy show.
