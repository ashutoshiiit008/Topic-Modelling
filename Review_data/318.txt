Driver (The Rock) avenge brother’s murder Killer Cop chasing him. With regular pace, one stereotypical revenge movie. The narrative linear director hasn’t even attempted induce depth leave viewer derive meaning movie. The story spells notable points,, irritated I could predict going take me. The script something I could come with. The movie doesn't justice either name genre. Not single scene could called ‘Faster’, hardly real action entire movie. Lot killings - yes, simple crushing ants (and wrestling all?!!). The lesser expected number gun fights made flat action film. The plot isn’t convincing enough great thriller, definitely audience used likes The Departed. I could done "Killer", it'd great see reason character's existence! Though Rock looks great muscle, acting expressionless face make wish wrestlers didn’t change professions. Even finer tuned character would made feel better. The director reserved dialogues Rock, terse that, two-sided coin. At least didn’t make worse forcing many too-good-for-him lines him. There character Cop lead, Billy Bob Thornton fine actor wastedhere. Oliver Jackson-Cohen plays Killer (and looks killer!), kid much learn. This case proves non-Bollywood directors also shove scantily clad hot-looking women significant roles attract audiences. A lot movie seems like waste makers’ energy, like emotional scenes tried heave random unnecessary push stories. Although better side, movie mindless killing. It story, climax could partly surprise you. Watch nothing better do.
