What? Was? That? Again, see I rid sense bewilderment, “What WAS that?” I understand need experiment add quirk love story simple gets. But maintaining age-old norms Bollywood, much ever spoof-like meant be, didn't work Aiyyaa. Aiyyaa slow, long tries best test patience. I know, I giving film benefit doubt projection issues screen I saw first 40 minutes second one another 10 minutes, 20 minute delay begin, following show canceled. So, I watched film next show. Yet, I willing go limb say sheer absurdity last half hour worth another “WHAT WAS THAT?” Yet, I don't write film 100%, basic idea. The idea attraction experienced woman sensitivity smells. Love first sight always intrigued me. I always wondered ticks. I always imagined communication eyes senses rather logic brain playing role one. And show either Discovery National Geographic smell plays major role couple interact other. And thus concept Aiyya uses fairly engaging one line plot. But boy, director Sachin Kundalkar overdone it. Anyway, seems enamored miraculous sense smell considering Marathi film Gandha three shorter stories connected using theme smell. But time seen Rani Mukerji heave closing eyes 10th time, you've enough. For want better phrase over-generalising way much taste, Aiyyaa carries heavy dose Marathi film sensibilities (barring likes Deool, Natarang, etc) Not complaint Aiyyaa. The loud, forcibly quirky characters Meenakshi (Rani Mukerji) destined Marathi family, get nerves first minutes. Amey Wagh, Jyoti Subhash, Nirmitee Sawant, Satish Alekar – well known Marathi film industry made plain weird add whackiness element director seems shooting at. Well, annoying kind whacky, kind grow enjoy. And let even get started Maina's (Anita Date) over-the-top, unfathomable derangement. The mockery people don't look normal used yet bring laughs. Rani Mukerji barely tolerable general, especially far usual shrieky self monologues. And couldn't anyone heavily Marathi crew point exaggerating ph, ai, sh speaking English punctuating Hindi 'aiyya' 'aga bai' make Marathi accent. Moreso, considering nearly naïve Marathi girl Pune basic theme film. Yet, I commend experimenting script. It's risk might failed, took risk admirable. Also, adds list lead ladies bringing size 8-10 back fashion. Unfortunately, depiction physical attraction woman experiences comes late performance story/film add value make film look even ludicrous. The juvenile symbolism makes even laughable. The climax another box weird worms simplistic Bollywoodization (yeah, yeah spoof-shphoof). I read synopsis couple places describe Aiyyaa, something includes Bollywood icon Rani Mukerji plays Marathi girl Meenakshi delightful 'Amelie'-style comedy. I hope isn't official synopsis. 'Amelie' style? Really? Such comparisons left audience, shouldn't they? Also, makers admitting to? And I guess, I add, loved almost everything Anurag Kashyap associated with, I never thought I'd ever say products, “aga, aai ga!” (MUMMY!!)
