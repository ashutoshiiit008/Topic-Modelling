That is, go first place! Fans Sooraj Barjatya - species extinct yet - might enjoy moments typical style. The rest us didn't care first place. The lead pair whispers listener delicate eardrums heroine heaves, head 45 degree angle, soon going need asthma medication. It acceptable first times - throughout movie though? All actors, lead supporting roles, try make best lines given them. The actor stands Seema Biswas, suits different character given. You predictable dialogues spoon-feed audience details obvious, leave technical details lest distract story (if called that). The predictable plot ‘world’s best’ human beings (especially over-virtuous, obedient hero nauseatingly shy heroine) – except one. Then predictable screenplay, place couple meet temples clandestine rendezvous rooftop. And surely, predictable exhibition expensive saris, salwar suits, jewelry. Kudos consistency!!! But, hey, music unpredictable – outright BAD! The good thing earlier Sooraj Barjatya movies least songs could appreciate saw least hummable. Songs Vivah make wish screeching stopped. Wake up, Mr. Barjatya, 80’s. We getting used much better cinema much better equipment provide us it. So, take us granted serve us sub-standard products!
