With themes like bribery corruption film almost always black white characters. I doubt way go it. System - bad, common man - good. Politician - bad, idealist - good. In sense, Satyagraha doesn't surprises all. But, unexpected comes little packages every - one-off expression Manoj Bajpayee slight deviation come expect films characters. Not takes away much predictability overall plot, even so. There's another thing films take stand social issue writer's zeal make point, characters take turns character graphs compelling reason. Satyagraha keeps away temptations. This keeps battle good bad interesting always waiting side's next move. Also, focus issue starts first minutes stays till end. Except course, detour Junction Romance. The one romantic sequence song follows sticks like sore thumb, quite literally. The picturization song weird place film wonder shot squeezed film afterthought. Fortunately, performances ace rate. Undoubtedly, forget he's Amitabh Bachchan worry Dwarka Anand's blood pressure beginning itself, see blood boil bitterness unfairness system. Ajay Devgn looks tad old age plays nothing like watching man shed tears screen appreciate performance, needless say well. No one brings spite towards negative character like Manoj Bajpayee. Kareena Kapoor, Amrita Rao, Arjun Rampal lay bits usual. Nothing sticks bad good. Yet, Satyagraha stays interesting issue close home. Sure, seen - films real life too. It manages provoke every feel like slapping arrogant policeman heart breaks see hero something self-destructive. Also, Satyagraha doesn't let characters easy - face opposition outside within factions. Things resolve rather easily conflicts brought point easy solutions. So engrossed Satyagraha making point couldn't bothered technicalities like editing, cinematography, etc. Other fact screenplay long-winded takes good two half hours go business, things like sudden close-ups actors, unnecessary songs extremely jarring, product placements on. However, times background score subtle invokes intended emotion. At times repetitive in-the-face background music. So, are, another 'message film aimed common man' later. You clap villain slapped, cheer heros' smallest victories stands take. You sit speeches even though bore you, acknowledge truth them. Then what? How bribing law/admin official next opportunity "required" to?
