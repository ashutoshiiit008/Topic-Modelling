So many movies based religious fundamentalism come gone, wonder stone left unturned territory. And comes along movie like Aamir defies standards film-making Hindi cinema, also breaks barriers approaching subject. Be warned though, slow paced, extremely serious cinema. Movies genre made inspire audience. And usually end inspiring long, unwieldy sermon climax. But here, since tune character going seeing him, start thinking would react situation. And ultimately, realize building towards inspiring action words. Every time I watch Hindi movie I feel protagonist going without anyone telling me, observation, scores me. Such brilliance performance Rajeev Khandelwal plays Aamir Ali. Despite knowing little kind person Aamir is, feel going particular day life. His performance adequately supported regular day-to-day dialogues. Also, since dialogues minimal, plain lines don't get boring. The dialogues given villain though repetitive thus mundane. Also, "villainish" things made chair dimly-lit room in-the-face unimaginative compared tone rest movie. Because come across typical, reminded actually watching movie. And thus hardly strikes terror minds audience. What terrorizing though, ambience created sets/locations. Be stench-filled place, claustrophobic hotel room Aamir confined in, crowded roads feels everyone watching - make feel like getting Aamir soon possible. The lighting keeps mind source natural light scene adds towards "natural" feel movie. Similarly, camerawork - especially close-ups handheld camera movements get deeper Aamir's state mind. Even combination slow pace short run-time works towards achieving required impact. There bit 3 minutes story, time actually elongated maybe almost double length. But since movie barely 90 minutes, engrossed, slow motion doesn't get annoying. The songs complemented style narration too. Especially "ghumiyo", way symbolic. The traffic jam Aamir trying resolve seems much like confusion life trying sort out. The background score thing seemed abrupt me. As music good, since didn't flow one scene another, felt jerky. Maybe, maybe movie could dropped one level rating scale part audience pace, build-up drama sensed closed, dark environment. It would injustice faculties film-making watching home, distractions smaller screen.
