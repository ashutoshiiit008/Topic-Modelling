What one thing historic,Indian patriotic films common? Oh yes, guessed right. Freedom fighters holding firelights hands belting heavily-worded, inspiring songs. I always wonder British captured freedom fighters hiding never singing openly. But things portrayed films. Being patriotic tale, I expecting mindless drama Vitti Dandu. The film didn’t surprise me, barring basic storyline. Revolved around vitti dandu – rural game, film fictional incident took place six days nation got independence. But core lies heartwarming relationship grandfather (Dilip Prabhavalkar) grandson, narrating story grandson. As takes stroll memory lane, tone voiceover changes abruptly. His narrative shows characters recounting memories; firsthand witness every happening. This whole affair makes wonder character genuinely reciting tale director Ganesh Kadam forcibly showing it. Vitti Dandu absolutely refreshing story paper. But turns exaggerated one screen. A conventionally-written screenplay over-the-top direction fail match sincerity story. Kadam rather tries depict fashion many films genre, eventually affecting performances brilliant actors. Except sequences, Prabhavalkar performs usual best. Rest cast passable. They seem driven characters, end unnatural theatrics. The film’s cinematography sorely misses point. A simple treatment could’ve helped set tone 1947. Production design, too, fails distinctively create era. Editing doesn’t help film either, making already lackluster narrative even vulnerable. Contemporary sounds effects lip-syncing songs totally out-of-place. Instead intensifying experience, add boredom. Indian films match Hollywood visual effects (doesn’t mean we’re superior departments). They are, fact, wonderful examples disastrous VFX. This despite fact major Hollywood productions outsourced Indian VFX studios. Considering budget; I don’t want delve Vitti Dandu’s visual effects quality, choice it. The director’s preference obviously fake appearances jeep-driving sequence definitely startling. The climax sequence one favorite terrible moments film. It somehow reminds mindless, south Indian action potboilers. I literally couldn’t stop laughing. This something unique makes Vitti Dandu outshine Indian patriotic films. An achievement itself, isn’t it?
