Rian Johnson’s Looper, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Bruce Willis, thrillfest film - fast-paced twists turns hook minute; much time spend idiomatic edge-of-your-seat, may overlook serious screen-writing flaws plot holes. Still, considering sci-fi film based time travel, getting airtight script near impossibility, Johnson’s deft direction doesn’t give enough time dwell flaws longer time takes next cut. The fun-and-games begin voiceover – Gordon-Levitt’s – introduces concept ‘Looper’ sets context film. In future (2074 precise) time travel invented, gets instantly outlawed. It used mob one specific purpose – people need killed sent back time 30 years (2044, much ‘present’ film) killed Looper. Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, Looper, who’s life seems rosy future self – Old Joe, played Bruce Willis, sent back killed ‘close loop’. The concept time travel tricky, virtually gazillion ways one go wrong depicting screen – simply absolutely point reference it. Rian Johnson’s time travel raises lot fundamental questions well, would considered plot holes weren’t fact given number interviews clarifying holes. But directors’ interviews aren’t part film, flaws still stand. Also, Gordon-Levitt’s voiceover popping every clarify things biggest problem film. It directorial screenwriting flaw, fact couldn’t suck viewer world film blow minds without resorting something un-cinematic voice-over. Even stands, film blow mind. But could taken next level could achieved without VO. But mentioned earlier, flaws swept away merits pace film.
