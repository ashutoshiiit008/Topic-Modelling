You'd think somebody would suggest guys writing cheques sequels uninspiring, sagging franchises won't quite cut risky business filmmaking is. Clearly though, nobody done yet. A whole battalion former stars, former stars additions, back provide loud bangs, done-to-death action sequences occasional smile-worthy lines film world could done easily without. The Expendables 3 film least couple moments make dismiss complete waste time, just. Expectedly, one begins one rather far-fetched action scene, proceeds more, finally ends long drawn action sequence. The question plot film is, then, moot. It's cute, honestly, film attempts tackle themes like loyalty love amongst brothers-in-arms; awkward relationship men share, can't openly expressive genuine love respect other, put life line time calls it. Too bad cynical times live means substantial majority audience, ideas belong cold storage - quite like men make cast. Even though all-action-star lineup well past sell-by date, still slight lingering air glittering machismo made likes Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes, Jason Statham Harrison Ford global superstars. Most look awkward screen now, save Jason Statham, also one lot could actually ever act. The welcome addition cast Mel Gibson, plays baddie unabashed glee; also gets best line film. Stallone, also credited story co-credited screenplay, gets meatiest role, though I use term relatively. It hard see anyone must actually credited story here, merely functional couple jagged cuts whole lines dialogue cut - presumably censor board's orders - seem make difference all. If one reason tad bit easier kinder Expendables film, to, say, Kick Jai Ho, technical wizardry disposal. All far-fetched action scenes merge live-action CG beautifully, making easier suspend one's disbelief. Real-looking ludicrousness is, all, quite easier buy tacky-looking ludicrousness. Hopefully, least plight film make makers see sense subject us part four. Even does, I doubt review film read differently one.
