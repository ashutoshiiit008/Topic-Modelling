Whatever you’ve heard Gasper Noe’s Irreversible true. It disturbing, graphic brutal, definitely film everyone watch. Maybe one reasons I wanted watch film. Not entirely rebellious streak, I remember reading review film long ago said shouldn’t seen women. I don’t know I wanted make point see big deal Irreversible, regardless, denying painful watch, reasons one. Irreversible told reverse narrative, couple, Alex (Monca Bellucci) Marcus (Vincent Cassel) head regular evening party. The movie follows Marcus Alex’s ex Pierre (Albert Dupontel), route revenge brutal act Alex. There sickening bouts violence sexual explicitness film, intention seems fairly clear director’s part. The idea make viewer feel extremely uncomfortable, swirling, shaky camera movements jarring, low frequency sounds dominate first thirty minutes film. Purposed achieved, except remains unclear fundamental plot film justifies treatment. It’s Noe decided wanted bully audience, experimentation portrayed Irreversible, barring fact hand-held shaky camera movements hardly experimental days. This might purist thought, filmmaker decides use certain experimental techniques film, shouldn’t basic story film sort connect it? As viewer deduce Memento used non-linear technique, explain complexities situation involving Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce). Lars Von Trier’s Antichrist also reputation graphic, viewing understand it’s part personalities lead characters. With Irreversible, however, one feels like Noe wanted make film involving sexual explicitness, extreme violence wanted experiment camera sound – chose first basic story came mind. Irreversible technically meticulous, doubt. The overall feel like camera’s handed omniscient bystander, control it. The film seems like it’s taken one shot, cuts cleverly included correct points. He’s played around idea time, terms narrative structure thought provoking dialogue – question relevance comes in. Somehow, end film don’t feel like reverse narrative justified – perhaps it’s climax, even though revelation, doesn’t match build narrative. The official DVD couple basic features like director’s commentary interview Belluci film. But star attraction DVD definitely making violent sexual scenes – certain tricks used invisible cuts planned. In defense, Irreversible hold certain vision emotions gone wild, translated visual experience. Maybe treatment faulty, might viewers who’d appreciate blurry, seemingly Avant Garde feel film, maybe I’ve missed point entirely. Nonetheless, Irreversible hard film; surely one extract extreme emotion you. Whether you’re man woman, warned watch it.
