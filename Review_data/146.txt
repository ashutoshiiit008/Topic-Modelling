What say film made true-life disaster? Not natural disaster. A disaster created human apathy greed; turning blind eye things fix keeping covered; believing right thing convincing due diligence; shirking responsibilities unapologetic negligences. The incident course unfortunate, Bhopal - A Prayer Rain brings events led eventual disaster engaging format. That's problem commenting films. People died suffering 30 years later. And I say film "engaging". What I say? Rajpal Yadav Tannishta Chatterjee wonderful job playing Dilip, Carbider Leela, wife representatives thousands workers/families died gas leak aftermath? Sure, camerawork created claustrophobia climax scenes. Throughout film sense foreboding, feeling crammed place can't get of. This comes even long shots slum areas city Bhopal general. It interesting indeed director, Ravi Kumar picked story format making documentary. In fact, adds touch dark humor too, beginning. The stories Dilip, Leela characters based real-life characters keep things close reality possible. Though Warren Anderson's character seemed rather muted ambiguous film. It difficult make stand was, maybe good shade grey really was. Yet, didn't feel complete. But, film gives space absorb. Not technical details - I sure must've over-simplified sake consumption/or lack available data - also dynamics go real life situation. Between politicians businessmen, workers superiors, across races. As see Indians on-screen enamored anything American, try discount fact 30 years ago, Indians indeed awe human white skin. And then, wonder. Would blood boil less end credits rolled, Union Carbide Indian company? Does matter one main reasons (as pointed film) disaster Indian solution, (jugaad sorts? Are senior employees, Indians included, less responsible gross negligence allowed? And then, wonder, I get answers questions. What change? What I do? The fact film made think, success, course. As I walked theater, I overheard young girl say phone, "Oh I need take break, I saw sad film." Should I saddened cynicism reinforced? Or I happy least girl came see film? How one respond film? At least watching first? ~ ~ ~ ps. I saw Hindi version film. I must say Martin Sheen speaking Hindi distracting. But, characters Indians, it's bad get past dubbing.
