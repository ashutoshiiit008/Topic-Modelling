The set-up Harry Pottery could get. Orphaned child used house servant close relatives. He two friends make life livable him. The plot deviates bizarre situations. And somewhere strange world created, science given credit. But, eyes 10-year old, must fun. So, it'd right kids watch comes around TV. My issue stories lack attention detail. So superhero 'zokkomon' doesn't superpowers, stuff enable science. How emit pretty lights around him? Maybe I'm scientifically challenged. But, it's good kids oversee stuff. They'll awed cool things boy age do. That's looked like reactions kids sitting beside me. They getting scared, exhilarated, laughing intended points. And worked target audience, worked. I think worked superhero didn’t go beyond age; pranks played well within child's imagination. He stayed age, didn't grow suddenly larger life stuff. Darsheel Safary's charming, not-overly cute persona works well Zokkomon. And he's good performer too. I loved expressions roller coaster ride. On hand, Anupam Kher annoying Deshraj. I think I something obvious wigs. But role Magic uncle pretty amazing. His makeup awesome demeanour. A pity writers don’t believe character-building. It's like can't don’t know to, started something really interesting yin yang, form science emotions. But it's taken further, there's high point conflict. Oh well, maybe that's heavy kids' film. For is, film good enough haul kids theater cough mandatory popcorn soda. But it's perfect 2 hour off-time kids plays TV.
