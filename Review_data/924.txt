Antoine Fuqua, whose last film Olympus Has Fallen silly could get, made dramatic u-turn The Equalizer. A calculated, dark film Denzel Washington playing kind character he's almost come synonymous with, film often gives sense deja vu - always good way. The Equalizer rather strange film, honest. A dark thriller either racy, measured. Fuqua chooses latter path, takes extreme. No surprises, heart-in-your-mouth moments, twists grab - nothing. Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall - regular man seemingly regular life, makes attempt living like clockwork. But past, McCall - comes fore situation calls it. Everything film understated - humour, gloss, grunge - it. Washington's McCall cool customer times; yet knows wield regular weapons, ordinary household object weapons well. The reason it, McCall's back story hinted at. We never get know went sort special-ops military living staid, lonely life. Presumably, he's done stuff he's either ashamed regretful for. And then, never quite know McCall turns around again, events film unfold. Perhaps it's feeling sorry character who, perspective, rough. Or case leopard able change spots. Either way, McCall takes fight injustice evil sees it, manner deems fit. Denzel Washington, indeed Robert McCall, ice cool ways one. A Sherlock-esque ability read situations; pleasant, fatherly demeanour; deadly fighting skills - he's perfect movie character, manner confuses even characters film. It aspect, straddling realistic edgy treatment style out-and-out 'movie' characters, The Equalizer stumbles often. Everything seems carefully planned out. When one deliberately chooses realistic tone treat film, tone lends feeling unpredictability, knowing might happen next. But The Equalizer, never happens, characters like these, know exactly what's going happen. It doesn't help Fuqua inserts 'cool' cinema techniques like slow motion rapid cuts while. The film thus ends becoming fascinating paper, particularly title. It's unequal world; world haves haves-not; world someone always one-up someone else. In world, need someone bring balance, even things bit. To equalize. Trapped image, Denzel Washington still manages rise seem like guy you'd want side odds stacked you. But walking tightrope real reel, end confused whether directionless journey character really amounts much. With slow pace film, often begin think point all. The shot-taking begins seem redundant, seems like soulless exercise, leaves feeling distant uninvolved. Bad guys who're good good guys who're bad - kinds make fascinating movie characters manage touch heart. The Equalizer makes sense most, doesn't touch heart.
