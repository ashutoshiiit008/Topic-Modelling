Another Tim Burton film starring Johnny Depp – totally see coming! After 7 films together, films now, celebration eccentric partnership anything else. Dark Shadows primary example fact. Obviously, Depp plays part absolute charm, (he’s like male Meryl Streep, incapable anything bad, I digress.) Dark Shadows however, like well-dressed girl nowhere go. It’s grand production, elaborate set design costumes, lacks substance. Based popular American soap opera early 70s, Dark Shadows surrounds vampire Barnabass Collins (Depp) resurrected coffin 1972 200 years. He finds glorious empire ruined, fisheries business falling. To top all, ruthless witch turned vampire, Angelique (Eva Green) ruling coastal town. The film tracks saves hometown, teaming Collins’ family matriarch (Michelle Pfieffer). The basic premise film scope – vampire 200 years ago still believes world starts ends him. He’s dated, humor stems fact doesn’t fit. Dark Shadows moments, mainly know Johnny Depp way wit. You find laughing, it’s also token humor know forceful. You realize keep expecting film get funnier – doesn’t. The performances manage give 140 minutes entertainment, ignore follies. Eva Green drop-dead gorgeous Angelique show stopper film. She’s sharp, funny (yes funniest part film sure) stunning. Like Tim Burton films, setting mood applaud-able. Sets, costumes dialogues transport eccentric alternate world governs Burton films. You also find soundtrack dominating rock classics 70s. Ofcourse, central factor Dark Shadows Johnny Depp – extravagant hairdos frills, experiments charm parade tries knock humor. Usually, it’s arrogance works, case seem laborious doesn’t story fall back on. If you’re fan Burton-Depp franchise, might either extremely disappointed expected blown away might settle complacent effort part. Dark Shadows could humorous, engaging film it’s made right decisions casting setting. As though, film falls short expectations – like half-baked attempt might enjoy worship Johnny Depp.
