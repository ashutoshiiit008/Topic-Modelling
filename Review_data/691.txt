We heard martial arts aficionados lamenting long hard years great heroes vanished. The Boss, Bruce Lee, died years ago, Jean Claude Van Damme Steven Seagal lit screens briefly late eighties long sunk oblivion. The scene East none encouraging either, Jackie Chan Jet Li ageing showing it, action hero there, win hearts strike fear enemy? Yes, dear fans, despair, lost yet. Tony Jaa detonated onto screens around six years ago Ong Bak, showcased particularly brutal Muay Thai style kickboxing. This real thing, wires, CGI, bullshit. Produced shoe string budget, Ong Bak Tony Jaa went carve rightful seat martial arts pantheon. Tony Jaa back summer Ong Bak 2 time clear wants, wants nothing known “The Action Hero”. The film opens spectacular sequence featuring crocodile, Cyclops like bruiser, spurting arteries, barbarous weapons. What could viewer ask for? The pace set ride blasts off. Amongst action sequences, director make attempt tell story. The story familiar motives revenge retribution telling plod parts. The sequence events unfolds circular back story past catches present. The director thrown “reflective” moments, seem designed viewer remind / / still breathing witnessing carnage onscreen. A brooding, long haired Tony Jaa stalks agilely film wisely utters lines dialogue throughout. His large, luminous eyes, manage convey degree suffering give hint inner tortured soul character possesses. So Tony film? Well, everything more. He tames rides wild elephants, displays mastery various martial arts styles including Japanese sword fighting kung fu, dances traditional Thai dance, even romantic interest. The romance fleeting hinted couple scenes. There spectacular fight end goes Tony fighting one masked black clad opponent another. There also beautifully choreographed fight set amidst, else, live elephant’s tusks, next! The ending abrupt unclear; fighting film sort blanks out. Tony moves doubt, fast, supple, power. In one scene pays tribute Jackie Chan, pounds villains drunk, another, fights three sectioned staff, tribute Bruce Lee whirling nunchaku. This film lavishly mounted compared predecessor, suffers due length. The length seems purely purpose making sure viewer gets see Tony stunts fights different contexts different styles. Sometimes palls, Tony’s intensity carries through. The fights bloody savage quarter asked none given. Martial arts fans; make sure see it.
