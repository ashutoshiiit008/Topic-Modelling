I’m one subscribe gender stereotypes kind, something men fast machines draw other. The sound high horsepower engine revving, sight metal beautifully moulded aerodynamic perfection, idea touching land-speed 300 km per hour, sheer romance living life edge – I don’t know rest, I know I enjoy cruising speeds excess one might consider safe, I know I’ve Formula 1 fan better part life now. If you’re Formula 1 buff, particularly F1 history, already know Niki Lauda James Hunt are, probably know 1976 F1 Championship context. If don’t know are, then, well, you’ll still probably enjoy Ron Howard’s Rush. For uninitiated, Lauda Hunt former F1 World Champions, thrilling on-track rivalry racing careers, right competed ‘lowly’ F3 together, way pinnacle motorsport – Formula 1. The peak great racing rivalry 1976 F1 Championship, forms core Rush, which, apart something biopic, also thrilling ode second watched sport world, spirit sport itself. Lauda Hunt starkly opposite personality, something really fuelled rivalry. Hunt charismatic, blonde, oozing masculine charm colourful professional well personal life. Lauda, hand, precise, meticulous dour, spoke necessary exactly much necessary. Their racing styles reflected personalities, undeniably terrific racing drivers. Quite simply, rivalry always film waiting happen. And film made for. Dramatic thrilling equal measure, films like Rush keep reminding us truth always fascinating fiction. Rush makes feel characters, makes want sit F1 car yourself, makes see competitive sport highest level about. It talent perseverance, win, important role destiny success zenith field. Ron Howard always strong sense embellishing drama, he’s top form Rush well. The thing great rivals field, fictitious real life, one other. Think Bernini Borromini; think Batman Joker; think Lauda Hunt; Howard writer Peter Morgan capture facet way that’s obvious yet beautiful; manner makes want pick side, also makes wonder whose side on. What also works really well film fact Howard handled racing scenes extreme dexterity well. From gorgeous long shots track cars extreme close-ups car parts mid-race, feel thrill adrenaline rush honestly bettered actually F1 car. I must confess that, seeing first promo film months ago, I thought Daniel Brühl fair choice Lauda, I little skeptical Chris Hemsworth playing James Hunt. I thought would bring much image character; I thought James Hunt would turn ‘Thor’ liking. However, Brühl Hemsworth outdone Rush. Their personalities play well, convince respect well loathing two characters other. Hans Zimmer, change, turned fairly minimalist score film. The music kicks required, largely plays second fiddle characters conflict, works well film. With much going it, thing Rush is, F1 fan almost guaranteed like it, I won’t surprised film makes converts well. Head theatres, then. Step it.
