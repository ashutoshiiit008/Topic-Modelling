If you’re sci-fi fanboy, almost definitely know J. J. Abrams is. And depending fall spectrum optimism cynicism, either hate love already. With keys Star Trek well Star Wars, Abrams definitely lot stand to. Well, Star Trek Into Darkness, Abrams already strike one, least book. Taking 2009 Star Trek, convenient changes series time-line enable modification certain elements, Into Darkness mostly insipid, long-winded often pointless film, perhaps highlight certain Mr. Benedict seems quite adept at, shall I say, Batch-slapping humans Klingons alike. When mysterious man carries attack Starfleet headquarters disappears space, Captain James T. Kirk, Spock, rest crew sent mission take out. The mystery behind new foe, however, deepens Kirk crew sucked series events don’t understand. While film never transgresses unwatchable territory cast, action scenes number inside jokes references, (some I’m sure I missed I’m Star Wars fanboy myself,) film long stretches pretends bit human drama friendship morals. That isn’t bad thing itself, tends weigh film down, neither play role raising tension stakes, particularly touch heart. Bringing nothing new table terms plot execution, film continuously gives feeling been-there-seen-that, ironical considering recognizable line franchise ‘boldly going man gone before’. Even so-called mystery plot mostly predictable even bare minimum knowledge series haven’t read much particular film. Not surprisingly, main reason people looking forward film – mouth-watering prospect Benedict Cumberbatch villain – thing remains continuously interesting film. He searing, enigmatic, fierce presence largely manages live expectations people him. Unfortunately, presence terms screen time far lesser one would hoped. Chris Pine Kirk same, although seem grown role Captain far more. Zachary Quinto Spock exactly last time around. Karl Urban, split two Star Trek appearances McCoy deadpan turn Judge Dredd last year, seems found renewed vigour time round. Abrams disappoints; there’s two ways that. Be control craft narrative, quite clearly lost plot. So much even great CG decent 3D post-conversion doesn’t help film rise heavily flawed uninteresting screenplay. His usual love lens flares, optical digital, makes film definitely looks good. But good enough justify spending time twiddling thumbs, waiting something happen. J. J. Abrams painted big red target onto himself, come 2015 Star Wars Episode VII hits silver screen, nearly every pair eyes universe him. And something tells galaxy, however far away, safe messes again!
