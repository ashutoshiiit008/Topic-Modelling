It always fun watch branded films like Singham Returns, whether like film ultimately. The audience enjoy I always enjoy enthusiasm. This once, though additional pleasure. First fifteen minutes film, know serious attempt developing plot. Another half hour in, hear one two people clap cheer rest audience joins realise viewers uncharacteristically quiet initial zeal. They hooked happening screen. Unfortunately, doesn't last film. There dips, especially second half climax simple bummer. Yet, Singham Returns started impact. In fact, pleasant surprise see subtlety form cinema. There's remark entire generation responsible "anything goes" attitude current generation, especially regard corruption. Then, "vote-buying" scene backdrop city skyline nice touch (even executed tackily). And alond similar lines. The dialogue writing, especially first half strikingly good. Even get "filmy", lot delivered smoothly appreciate dialogue delivery dialogue itself. At times unexpectedly contextual, times even insightful/profound. But, course, loses steam second half. The writer's passion showing hard-working, dutiful facet Mumbai police shines through. It's almost takes offense personally, people try bribe policeman street. Not single policeman corrupt arms right thing, even risk losing beloved job. It almost official Union gone strike people see good them. I'm usually sympathetic towards women's role films genre woman woman, necessary prop types. But, Singham Returns gives Kareena Kapoor share screen space, quality appearance makes wish hadn't. She like romantic-cum-comic relief used elongate runtime film. The romantic track long theme film, annoying loud over-done, out-of-place doesn't seem received writer's attention compared rest film. It felt like chore needed get way. It also loud, undoubtedly unnecessarily. I'd love see quieter version film without romance comedy sure. Somewhere top list things make film loud Kareena Kapoor. She shrill irritating over-acting. This seems rub women characters even small bits get like Constable Mahesh's wife woman slums supports taking money political party vote. In comparison, men seem control. Even caricature Godman baba Amol Gupte plays looks mild comparison, though over-the-top. Zakir Hussain appropriately arrogant scared politician whose career dependent upon way tide flows. In midst Ajay Devgn's soothing presence even doesn't emote much. Even so, one unmissable screen presence, including Ashwini Kalsekar plays over-enthusiastic journalist. Setting aside stretched romantic track lame attempt humor, even action choreography CGI seems half-hearted time around. Except flying Ajay Devgn entire film, real attempt adding element oomph action sequences. As difficult I find believe, focus story point trying make. That brings regular readers waiting read - It Rohit Shetty film, little less like Rohit Shetty film, actually trying make sense trying keep one expects Rohit Shetty film alive. Fortunately, earlier latter.
