Will film tug Marathi Manoos' patriotic strings precision? Oh yeah!. Did work me? Well, entirety. Because I'm target audience, here. I don't belong community feels marginalized. And that's biggest complaint film. A film strong belief it's saying, could appealed larger audience. So strong Marathi flavor replace community another one won't work Marathi community. This feeling impotency one community feels easily extrapolated various segments society. Sure, enough communities Marathas feel similar aggravation - situation might different, powerless feeling similar. Sure, film talks Marathi populace's helplessness doing, one really stopped achieving potential. But comes goes away ever slightly amongst strong dialogues feels mild almost irrelevant. Not mention stereotyping first place heavily exaggerated. These among lesser important things movie doesn't work. Despite enthusiasm vibrating theater. Despite sloganeering hushes quickly, don't miss next powerful dialogue. The dialogues situations inspiring alright, inspire one theater? Unlikely. Because situations ultra-unrealistic, solutions utopian over-simplistic. There way even fraction solutions implied workable. Here, Lage Raho Munnabhai meets Rang De Basanti approach fails lacks former's adaptability latter's universal appeal. Almost performances theatrical feel like watching play. The staged feeling doesn't leave long. Though, couple father-daughter scenes handled sensitivity bring lump throat. Yet, film's strongest points remain theatrical dialogues Marathi Bana style delivery. The strong folk flavor music compliments sentiment film too. together keeps attentive entertained. They dramatic yet work. And let remind coming person patience over-dramatization on-the-face loudness. With strength dialogues engages drama keeps there. However, doesn't get involved. I still feel like outsider, unable relate replace situation I've experienced heard of. Maybe, I've blessed environments I've never stereotyped against. The film also made wonder community I feel sense belonging towards. Couldn't think any. Except maybe women. Maybe, day moviemaker make movie marginalization reviewers I'll feel like hooting whistling audience. Yeah, yeah, I know irony. The contradiction first serving us hyperbolic, sorry state Marathi population repeatedly listing one Maharastrian achiever another every field annoying. And time attempt replace word Maratha (from Marathi community) Maharastriya (Maharastrian - resident state) commendable subtle amongst overwhelming furor rounds.
