I love watching cricket. I love batsmen. I love veterans much new blood. I love spinners, I love pace bowlers. I love fielding abuse misfielding often not. And yet I cannot make watch rerun match. Even won. Even favorite batsman scored century. Even bowler broken world record. Well, I say, I kind cricket-fan. Imagine plight I watch entire movie match, I know result (duh! The name movie 'Victory!!), also know ball-by-ball. Yes, predictable!! Sure, scriptwriting textbook says set-up, conflict, resolution. But guys seem taken tad seriously. Each act build limit even novice movie-watching forecast next step two that. The goes lame lines given one all. I agree cricket-crazy country. But repeating - every 5 minutes - entire nation, ONE BILLION us looking at/down upon cricketer excited about/disappointed outcome becomes much handle. Considering overall issues writing department, actors done one helluva job! Hurman Baweja certainly come long, long way Love Story 2050. He actually cry convincingly. Very male leads manage look like comedians that. Amrita Rao comfortable usual homely, warm character. Though occasionally bursts inner voice different characters brings senses. But, I really want see something different. Wouldn't want too? Anupam Kher, course, makes lines we've heard past decades. The pride father, stoop shoulder, agony, anger, frustration credited years experience. Its like predictability sin. O-kay is. But unforgivable one. But movies beautiful despite committing one. This one not. Maybe, maybe, might worked hour shorter. Or maybe not.
