A movie set around 9/11 bomb blasts overt messages lectured across screen! Itâ€™s Indians staying abroad, yet none typical cultural drama related diaspora. Okay, I know sounds like I liked movie not, rather was. But, movie simple love story set middle Hindu-muslim divide prevalent South Asian community settled US. In 75 minutes, four characters situation developed reasonably well. In fact, two adorable scenes romance Ali (Amit Sial) feels beloved established. Also, director, Tanuja Chandra makes smart move telling us much relationship Saloni (Mahima Choudhary) Harry (Vikram Chatwal). It adds believability follow. Situations transitioned one another subtly without many dialogues. Characters smart enough understand situation without spell them. The audience treated respect spoon-fed. I realized I've become used melodrama I felt relief every point melodrama could easily resorted to. There couple times awkward situation built pregnant pause, resolved simple one liner - straight is, without ham-haw-ing. Having said that, couple character transitions happened bit quickly thus tilted towards unbelievable. This could also focus seemed narrating over-simplified story rather presenting particular character's point view. This I thought created certain distance characters audience. But, times felt characters sincere performances entire cast. It refreshing see Anupam Kher role name written it. The pride, joy, grief, hatred translucent see through. Your hearts reach Mahima Amit too. And I think first time I seen many expressions Suhasini Mulay's, otherwise stiff face. Like style narration, camerawork also subtle minimal movements. Also, colors used dull, yet realistic, hue. There bright colors staring face. In fact, colors almost matched stock footage used 9/11 blasts. Hope little sugar short sweet story told well. The characters charming treatment thought out. But yet, weird gap left unexplained super-quick transformations characters situations.
