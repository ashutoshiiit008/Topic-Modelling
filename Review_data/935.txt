The Host, based novel Stephenie ‘Twilight’ Meyer directed Andrew Niccol, easily one silliest films you’ll see year. A sappy, puke-inducing romance set future aliens invaded Earth taken bodies nearly every human being, save few. The thing film even remotely going visuals don’t tire you, even nearly everything else film makes want pull hair out. The film tells us story Melanie, human whose body host alien soul; that, way, modus operandi aliens. Except feisty Melanie one rare humans able fight alien - inner battle occurs two souls one body. The reason this? Didn’t I mention something puke earlier? One fundamental flaws film, one anyone even quarter squid’s brain wonder about, exactly problem aliens. They largely peace-loving, opening voiceover tells us aliens actually done planet Earth world good; violence all, Earth beautiful ever before. In fact, film actually celebration glorious faults humankind. We greedy, violent beings, often succumb carnal calls, invariably break rules won’t think twice putting loads human lives danger, benefits us individually way. The ‘aliens’ exact opposite, mention fact far technically advanced us. Yet, somehow, film tries sell us fact humans deserve rule earth far aliens do. That apart, romance aspect film inane, absolutely silly, want everyone love film die; gruesome death. Unfortunately us, doesn’t seem way Stephenie Meyer operates. I must confess, I’ve never watched read anything Twilight series. And considering standing joke pop culture, I’ve always wondered bad Twilight way. Well, Twilight even half silly The Host, I’m glad I stayed away it. What’s surprising Andrew Niccol’s decision direct film. I’ve liked number previous films, ones he’s directed, ones he’s written well. The former include cult hit Lord War, cerebral Gattaca, even guilty indulgence In Time, latter include films like The Terminal The Truman Show, amongst others. He’s always seemed fondness films set future, he’s almost always managed make reasonably convincing. The Host, however, unmitigated disaster. It doesn’t help one characters faces film appeal way. The way characters written, performances cast - mostly bland. Only William Hurt Diane Kruger supporting cast make impact. Saoirse Ronan, plays Melanie virtually anchor film throughout, tries best, really comes quite short. Even sci-fi film, The Host filled many logical inconsistencies screenplay problems you’re waiting film get soon possible, perhaps flush away experience film earliest. In fact, really existed alien race like one film ever saw The Host, they’d probably break non-violent ethics shoot head.
