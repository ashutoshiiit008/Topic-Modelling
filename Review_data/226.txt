The best part Salman Khan film herd Salmaniacs surrounded by. Oh, whistles, cheers, non-stop cackle overall enthusiasm. I would get many Salman film middle kind energy. And Dabangg 2 didn't even that! The crowd surprisingly cold except mandatory excitement grand-entry time songs. But, usually songs get fans. The first series, Dabangg teenage girls audience dancing background music final fight sequence. Here restricted general cheering hooting. Since I don't get mania anyway, unlikely enjoy film itself, barometer audience reaction - rather underwhelming. The introductory action sequence feels like recap Dabangg wait something new fun terms action come soon. You keep waiting. There nothing new funny them, repetitive. Only time, sound design 'action' rather usual camera and/or editing. In name action choreography, people fall here, everywhere old fashion. In stead served one song another, obviously inserted give feeling Sonakshi Sinha something do. And one even pitted Malaika Arora Khan, I didn't quite understand. Was way making contrast terms looks dancing skills even apparent? Let's waste breath story, it's old cop, goon-turned-politician. Only one conveniently honest Robin-Hood-cum-Kungfu-Panda. Interestingly, cops honest want right thing. This version Bollywood cop though soon amalgamating one, 'star' playing changes - Dabangg Singham Rowdy Rathore police officer fusing together one difficult tell apart other. That two Sonakshi Sinha lead lady two Prakash Raaj villain doesn't make easier. Of lot, Prakash Raaj extent Vinod Khanna try best bring life characters. The rest drill, ably led Salman Khan. Is disconcerting Salman fan playback singer, Sukhwinder Singh singing soul barely moves lips lip-sync? How cool? So, Salman Khan continues adorn 'acting' attitude nonchalance. He gets play silly pranks slide cute. Speaking silly, silliest gets sillier left choice give laugh. Yet, dialogue especially one-liners, save maybe one two, carry weight. Not even repeat lines given characters order define them, la 'aata maajhi satakli' Dabangg's 'chhed'. To top relatively funnier lines lot repeated push throat make sure 'got' them. However, I enjoy language lot. 'Clean' Hindi indeed refreshing, even sounds fake forced. I know Salman Khan film place me. But, I really love theater, especially hope lively audience. Here's hoping work next time around like Dabangg. Oh yes, Dabangg 3. ps. Yes, yes, ladies (and gentlemen) shirt comes off.
