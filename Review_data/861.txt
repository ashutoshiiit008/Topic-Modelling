Soundtrack starts us following pretentious-looking Raunak (Rajeev Khandelwal). Raunak seen tapping feet stopping lend ear rhythms life. Having seen liked Rajeev Khandelwal's earlier work I assumed Raunak must actually shallow fake terms understanding music. But turns actually good ear music. Which means Rajeev Khandelwal isn't good job. The sinking feeling gets worse OD drugs, alcohol sex. And story begins boy suck - performances narration. Soundtrack good example simple, predictable story told heart devotion. You start either hating unmoved character next hour find caring him. You want well, however predictable makes film. This achieved mediocre production values. There fancy camerawork; neither gimmicks used depict neurosis Raunak going through. The thing average sound design. That too, isn't anything marvelous it. And even though tools aren't used, narrative engages audience. Rajeev Khandelwal doesn't disappoint one bit. In hindsight, even act first 10-15 minutes overlooked Raunak rather cocksure selfish character. I totally loved Soha Ali Khan, real act starts way second half yet come out, character left impression couple scenes remind her. Soundtrack runs along themes life, uncertainties people deal completely fail deal dealt them. But, also indirectly touches upon mental illnesses. While solution Soundtrack comes might medically sound, probable correct; importance strong depicted overcoming odds slim ray hope people go dark times. And important reason Soundtrack works based true-life story. The impact two words, "true life" enough give Soundtrack shot. And I'd recommend theater watch, impact could lost/reduced watched interruptions/distractions.
