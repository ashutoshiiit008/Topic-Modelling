Perhaps biggest tragedy film viewing culture India disinterested us documentaries. Most people equate documentaries yawn, perhaps. But ever someone loves cinema doesn’t like documentaries needed example gripping, emotional narratively-strong documentary be, without venturing far comfort zone, film show would Shivendra Singh Dungarpur’s acclaimed documentary Celluloid Man. The film deeply personal nostalgic take life P. K. Nair, man almost wholly responsible known National Film Archives India (NFAI), Pune. And journey film, also understand true passion cinema is; someone devoted collecting archiving films posterity, understands people – perhaps films offer comprehensive indicative representation times, even films collected archived ‘fiction’. Shot foremost cinematographers India - names like Santosh Thundiyil, K. U. Mohanan, Mahesh Aney, Vikas Sivaraman, Kiran Deohans likes – film also looks Mr. Nair’s life eyes respected names Indian cinema; number former students Mr. Nair Film & Television Institute India. Through rich anecdotes little stories highlight man’s tireless work result – prints tens thousands film across world stored, work great masters worth many times weight gold - film heartfelt ride inspiring humbling time. Clocking two half hours, film still felt short, me; beautifully engaging story man who, I must shamefully admit, I didn’t know I heard film late 2012. While primarily life P. K. Nair, journey, film also touches upon many little-known facts India’s film history people behind it. Just mere names legends mentioned – Ritwik Ghatak, example - gave goosebumps. Then, hear highly stalwarts Indian cinema regarded Mr. Nair, aptly sums immeasurable contribution documentation history Indian cinema. The painstaking manner went acquiring restoring prints, way encouraged students view cinema way must viewed, little joys experienced acquiring particular print brought it’s little highs lows – live much film. If problems I found, directorial choices anything else. So, one disagree them, one can’t fault them. They were, all, choices made director, ones completely entitled to. For example, manner certain scenes involving Mr. Nair ‘staged’ documentary; quite obviously shot visual appeal propel story forward, even though aren’t part Mr. Nair’s routine. Or even interludes director’s voiceover used bring certain information fore. As I said, I disagree usage, can’t really faulted. Then, all, film remarkable doesn’t show importance archiving cinema, importance preserving memories life, importance passionate do, importance understanding life worthwhile best ensure means something. Celluloid Man move you, reinforce fact cinema life.
