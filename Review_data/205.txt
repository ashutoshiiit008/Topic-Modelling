There seems sort desperate urge among producers attempt unexplored genres Marathi cinema late. It perhaps safe bet them. And subject sex, unwilling back it? After all, projects receive unprecedented amount publicity begin guarantee least return investment due course. Majority purely box office-oriented, try remarkably different. In endeavor kill two birds one stone, Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel ends performing badly neither appears money-making distinctive. The film victims illegal trade filming circulating sexually explicit videos MMS. Writer-director Divakar Ghodake chooses narrate story eyes researcher visit Pareni tribes. So sets drama protagonist’s voiceover film begins falter. I fail understand voiceover keeps telling story viewpoints characters well. The mix-up touching tale socially-ingrained message actually biggest cause failure. The lack emotional touch voiceover makes wonder narrator really heart-wrenching story tell interested making social commentary. As film advances, voiceover hardly creates suspense instead serves spoilers throughout. As must guessed now, Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel actually name MMS video (meaning film clip shot 3.0 MP camera). This video clip interestingly opens message – “The whole event scripted”. Appallingly, event scripted shoddily cannot categorized either film sex video. If aim capture emotional turmoil sexually-exploited women, film filled multi-layered, confusing elements. And aim make sex-driven film, fails miserably. The film documents real-life incidence shocked rural Maharashtra years ago, understandably set state’s scenic ghats. A minutes film, start wondering actually witnessing National Geographic program picturesque Western Ghats. Stunning cold frames don’t add value story however. In Love Sex Aur Dhoka, Dibakar Banerjee planted cameras stories masterfully (except aspiring director’s one) – letting camera narrate film creatively engagingly. In Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel, camera’s perspective (a mobile phone camera) hardly used. Flashbacks voiceover little help lay tale. The makers possibly didn’t want create another LSD, logical too. But better use camera’s viewpoint would least stopped film predictable. Camera angles first MMS clip surely raise questions. If camera placed ground, world high-angle shot even filmed isolated place? Not camera placements also overall execution tells lot director’s carelessness researching subject. Not mention well-composed, ruthlessly used musical pieces. Foreplay scenes way superficial poorly choreographed, videos look aesthetically gorgeous – missing realistic punch. Both Seema Azmi (Chak De fame) Ashish Pathode uninteresting, despite fine appearances respective roles. Bleak dialogue tiring background score make matters worse, quickly become impatient. At 84 minutes; film shorter runtime Dhobi Ghat, still comes interval. Even so, better edit could easily cut hour so, eventually making predictable film far engaging. Ghodake apparently credited several Oscar-winning films VFX computer graphics. Fake-looking newspapers camera lens directorial debut however create doubts. If you’re witness story, you’ll disappointed beginning. And want see sex, regret watching till end.
