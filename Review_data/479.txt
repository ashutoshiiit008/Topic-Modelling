One annoying things films aren't working genre switch tend make film. Did writer/director want make romantic film? Or thriller shooting for? Or psycho's story trying narrate? Or wish comment system part of, rotting insides? Or intention steamy scenes featuring real-life porn star, trying see far could push envelope? Jism 2's jerkily shifts one another without attempt keeping smooth flow. And directorial/editorial experiment talking about. The movie goes narrating whatever little content has, time world fast-paced, quirky cuts. It slow mostly boring. The romance laden mumbo-jumbo philosophy. The thriller doesn't manage engage much despite potential Robin Hood-ish protagonist has. His psychopathic inclinations seem out-of-place entertained life experiences, motivations perception. A monologue end film hardly something suddenly get us interested. And far steamy scenes go, you've seen pretty much all, you've seen trailers. Unless call heavy-duty heaving part body language contributes acting, Sunny Leone can't act. She barely screen presence terms captivating attention presence screen. Arunoday Singh Randeep Hooda try best emote, wrong film. And whatever ultimately feels like overdoing it. Everything frame looks fake forced. The emotions, relationships, connections, attractions, power, anger, helplessness. Then left hollow dialogue fill might happening. And exactly words sound like even seem like trying make profound sense. At times inane. On hand, I wasn't expecting much film either, question sitting waiting slow proceeds done with.
