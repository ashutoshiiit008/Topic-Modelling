When I first watched trailer Ender’s Game, exhausted even though couple minutes long. The space-sci-fi setting – overdone recent times – seemed cumbersome; VFX looked all-too-familiar; Harrison Ford, long-time favourite mine, seemed jaded; and, quite simply, plot film didn’t seem inspiring. Obviously, then, expectations film close nil. I’d like believe, though, wasn’t rock-bottom expectations led fairly intrigued film I finally watched it. Set 50 years planet invaded subsequently reclaimed alien species known Formics, learn powers-that-be zeroed peculiar manner countering attacks – training Earth’s brightest adolescent minds tactical military strategy. It isn’t completely fault particular film, arrived towards fag end year saw films like Oblivion, Gravity, Elysium, After Earth, Pacific Rim, Star Trek Into Darkness many more. Despite based book name written way back 1985, Ender’s Game seems many elements – big small – similar films seem lot like déjà vu; mention often reminds seminal sci-fi flicks like The Matrix Star Wars. Still, film manages hold time reach end it, reasons one. Despite futuristic setting, problems young Ender faces hit home. He’s curious, brilliant child, bit misfit; doesn’t well authority, quite prone bursts rebellion. Apart usual save-the-world effort, film, then, also coming-of-age story young Ender. Far interestingly, film also clearly raises questions art war itself. Does war place morality? If war, winning sole objective war? What way win it? Does history remember victor remember side fought morals intact? Even rather pertinent questions film raises, within periphery Ender’s story; thus coming across fairly lightweight breezy. Not pace film brisk, keeps toes guessing, throwing twist two, while; right big climactic twist, pushes film notches. Asa Butterfield, last seen blue-eyed, angelic titular boy Martin Scorsese’s Hugo, plays titular character Ender’s Game. His eyes remain piercingly blue, difference innocence childhood replaced teenage angst moral dilemma. Unusually lean scrawny lead character film scale, unassuming physicality truly makes stand character. Besides, boy intensity one rarely sees actors today, helps film tremendously. Harrison Ford Colonel Graff appears worn jaded film seemed trailer. Also – though could - every time film midst space battle simulation scene Ford sitting console trying train young cadets fight, I couldn’t help wishing whizz away Millennium Falcon show it’s done. Viola Davis Sir Ben Kingsley, roles didn’t particularly need actors caliber, well enough anyway. Director Gavin Hood, also credited screenplay writer, doesn’t ever let proceedings get heavy tedious. The plot twists fun keep hooked large part. And though VFX aren’t particularly outstanding, they’re largely unobtrusive, letting story talk itself. This helps film well. With runtime two hours, then, Ender’s Game surprisingly watchable film, sets nicely franchise future.
