The Woman Black, simplistic title is, haunt couple minutes walk theatre. That’s sign successful horror film, would say. The film reminds 1960s horror films (the production house Hammer Films quite success run), elaborate production design, familiar horror tropes plot one can’t go wrong with, spite spooking successfully, quite bones one pick. However, horror went looking for, unadulterated horror get. Adapted Susan Hill’s novel name, The Woman Black set Victorian era young attorney Arthur Kipps (Danielle Radclife) sent North England sell (haunted) house cut away village, reached long marshy causeway covered sea high tide. Arthur’s job revisit house original occupant’s missing documents. Local legend house haunted woman mourns death child, something villagers nothing stop. Arthur realizes could reason number children dying village. He goes ahead job, despite multiple warnings locals. We introduced financial burden beginning, even though could reason enough go haunted house, Radcliffedoes decent job selling curiosity us, house story. It’s idea married man kid doesn’t go well. You keep trying understand, would cast Radcliffe part – dearth actors looked 30 plus? Because Radcliffe certainly not. He also perennial expression face – kind Harry Potter carried movies every moment looming danger. Minus points repetitive acting disbelief there. Having said that, film’s production design reminds homes genuinely give creeps – kind haunted houses needn’t much, it’s play light, shadows, rocking chairs wound-up toys enough creep out. In sense The Woman Black relies old-school horror tricks, creaking staircases, random glimpses half-decomposed ghosts black, doors shutting tight own. We could thank The Woman Black reminding us get spooked simplest things. A good amount spine-chilling visuals also add entire horror film experience. Cameraperson Tim Maurice-Jones knows needs get entire picture together – aerial shots misty sea pure grey hues, shadowed forest trees play light regular minimalistic piano background music - you’re gearing 95 minutes periodic covering eyes jumping seat.
