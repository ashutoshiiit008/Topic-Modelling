We love heroes. We sing tunes. We dance moves. We read tirelessly. And even follow films mindlessly. But extraordinary hero, might never heard seen before? Will people throng theatres watch unusual hero celluloid? Well, I found answers I saw audiences turning big numbers first day, first show Samruddhi Porey’s Dr. Prakash Baba Amate. The auditorium buzzing excitement. Though died shortly. The film official biopic Dr. Prakash Baba Amte – man (played masterfully Nana Patekar) sacrificed entire life tribals wild animals Hemalkasa area Maharashtra. It traces struggle Amte wife Dr. Mandakini Amte (Sonali Kulkarni) tribals, wild animals, naxalites corrupt government officials. The film takes back era man lived, worked even performed emergency surgical procedures without electricity. The way developed personal bond tribals wild animals one fascinating aspects Amte’s story. This tale undoubtedly heroic. However, film. At least way narrated. I don’t understand, director, Porey overemphasise protagonist’s heroics every single scene? Actually, outcome passé, lacklustre writing. Its screenplay structured typical manner. I know, flashbacks inside flashback look bold. But they’re handled carefully. Considering subject, occasional slow-paced narrative somewhat justified. But drama hooks storytelling? Every department film seems haywire - writing-direction, cinematography, editing, sound design even makeup. Mahesh Anye’s Cinematography beautiful, undoubtedly. But fails add value storytelling. What’s use capturing stunning shots, rarely tell story? That wow factor missing throughout film. The visuals audios sometimes poles apart. When you’re dying see drama, you’re bombarded philosophy. But actually get see it, barely feel anything it. You see gore, feel nothing characters situations. That another letdown. The film’s saving grace Nana Patekar Sonali Kulkarni’s acting prowess. Both lead actors back (after Taxi No. 9211 Deool charm power-packed, sizzling chemistry. However, directing talented, lead cast isn’t big deal. The real challenge bring good performances extras (mostly tribals) well. Nagraj Manjule's Fandry beautiful example describe it. This Porey fails miserably. Average films turn better (of course, extent) thanks smart editing. However; film’s amateurish, outdated editing adds woes. The film sequences emotionally relate to. They simply beautiful too. But director’s overall focus seems telling (sometimes showing) almost everything happened. This leaves disheartened. “Dr. Prakash Baba Amte - The Real Hero” isn’t terrible film entirety. The makers fascinating story tell two best actors industry has. They definitely seem good intention (who wants make bad film anyway?) It’s approach went wrong. The sad part official biopic Amte. I doubt inspirational tale would ever retold.
