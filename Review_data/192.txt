A film supposedly common man represented Mussaddi make identify him, even though I've gone situations Mussaddi. What could bigger failure film? Have times watching film side-story interesting enough makes say, "wow, film itself." Looks like, makers Chala Mussaddi - Office Office similar epiphany watching Lage Raho Munnabhai's pensioner scene. Unfortunately, made awfully pale tale it. A tale talent like Pankaj Kapoor couldn't anything help. I look forward Pankaj Kapoor films somehow even I watched trailer Chala Mussaddi - Office Office, I cringed stereotypical babu (bureaucrat) representation. The irony I heard concept, would excited me. I don't think enough films made deeply engrained corruption is. But don't really want films exaggerated repetitive staging reality. The characters caricatures regular amount disgust-inducing. While I liked fact actors appeared various roles, theme soon became boring. The one good thing film characters don't suddenly transform. The good-for-nothings dishonest remain so. No amount speeches appeals move hard-hearted bureaucrats. It also said climax sort-of, kind-of redeeming circular reference gets into. Also, takes action high recurring theme Mussaddi going office office get rightfully first place. But, answer idealistic simplistic. Then again, maybe solution simple. Maybe work corruption starts home simple things. Maybe point let problem become big stage theatrical climax solution. Sorry digress though, thoughts mine despite inconsequential film.
