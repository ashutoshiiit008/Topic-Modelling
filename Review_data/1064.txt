Director Marc Forster steadily built solid little CV number watchable, really interesting, films. Though quite league better work -Finding Neverland Monster's Ball, example - latest film, long-in-production zombie-actioner World War Z, surprisingly doesn't exactly filmography much harm either. World War Z get Steven Sodherberg's Contagion mates Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, added dose serious crack good measure. An unknown, fast-acting pathogen affects humans spawned deadly horde zombies quickly turning entire cities vast fields undead. Gerry Lane, retired United Nations field investigator reluctantly pulled quiet retirement identify source virus. Despite clear attempt lend air credibilty zombie genre, thus far either made strictly fans genre coupled comic element, World War Z crumble serious examination. It abandons coherence space time, takes umpteen liberties screenplay singularly unmemorable cast, save Brad Pitt, looks little haggard battle-weary, strictly single-handedly takes zombie armies either. Also, denying this, World War Z kind predictable, done-to-death film Hollywood stranger to. Still, World War Z ends watchable enough, genuine thrills film manages pack runtime, Ben Seresin's breakneck cinematography manages create perceptible sense atmosphere despite showing evident disdain towards lucidity close-combat action scenes, superbly-executed VFX. Also, even tired-looking, underwhelming Brad Pitt goods enough pack wallop effortless screen presence. Also, though could possibly softie me, first time zombie film heart reach little bit zombies themselves. In fact, considering seriously film takes itself, I personally felt squandered opportunity show zombie-like existences become. After all, purpose-less, materialistic life hardly better un-life zombie; least zombies purpose - infecting humans. Expectedly, resolution film far-fetched be. And perhaps Brad Pitt's persona helps most; need kind presence overlook truly incredulous goings-on actually are. Apart last 20 minutes film, I really missed kind urgency brought character Babel sheer confident cockiness displayed Moneyball. The film 2D well 3D, again, film would far better experienced 2D. The 3D darkens already dark film, doesn't really add much terms 'third dimension' anyway. World War Z really film fans rugged action saving-the-world films, kind film audience take seriously, even filmmakers done so.
