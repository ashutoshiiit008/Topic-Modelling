Good romantic comedies far between. Well, course, I mean ones make laugh go "awwww" alternately. There others try wish hadn't. Khoobsurat honest moments make want fall love times laugh loud. That say doesn't clich√©s things go word Disney, prince princesses. In sense, Khoobsurat (2014) differs Khoobsurat (1980) one significant way. The focus much romance binding family, necessarily bad thing. The remake steers original, better chances working. The biggest surprise Sonam Kapoor. It's like left loose, like finally gotten comfortable front camera. In many ways, reminded Kareena Kapoor Jab We Met Katrina Kaif Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara Rekha original Khoobsurat. Doesn't help characters similar, stiff women films films saw let go. There charming details (other prince himself, later). The supporting characters King Rathod's aide, Ramsevak King Rathod himself; prince's little sister Divya mom, Her highness, Nirmala Rathod (her first name nod corresponding character original film). The characters slight flourishes keep interested played well actors themselves. The sore thumb form Kirron Kher. Isn't done playing loud Punjabi mom yet? I understand Punjabi background comes handy want show genes transferred produces uber-chirpy Mili (Sonam Kapoor). But, tiring see stereotype. What helps though accentuate stark contrast Mili Prince Vikram (Fawad Khan). Fawaad Khan lovely restraint persona. It like role meant only. While needs hold one expression film, need deviate, slightest change yet makes believable. What also keeps things believable palatial setting day-to-day one-liners. The kind I would quip nonchalantly laugh hard over. Some situations created way resolved rather normal too. And normal way doesn't bore you. That part real life don't mind seeing reel. Not mention, change voiceovers start sounding awkward turn amusing train thoughts every one has, thinking one thing saying another. Another thing though I really loved, sure went tone film Sneha Khanwalkar's music. It lovely quirky ring thankful existence irrespective whether meant said film. I don't I happy sad someone else end-credit song. Where Khoobsurat misses characters transition. Perfectly consistent characters grown you, change suddenly. It seems bit convenient. A little predictable effort masking predictability. The movie wasn't going end way, know I. But effort staying away typicality would've kept tone film till end. Yet, it's something I would recommend light Sunday afternoon. It guilty pleasure. It saccharine sweet fluffy. It candy floss - won't satiate appetite, feel good little after.
