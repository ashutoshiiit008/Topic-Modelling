In midst pure chaos, man purpose wants commit suicide. He point make. And makes too. The problem audience mere human. It impossible us ignore ado pay attention meek voice. I didn't go looking logic, I know genre I know dislike it. I try balance telling myself, "enjoy is." But, enjoy slapstick doesn't make smile even once? How let hair loose trying best keep hands away tearing apart? How get interested acting versus background score competition loudness? I'm told things define genre. But me, looks like last ditch effort involved milk whatever star-power waning years. And that's shame one cast - Anil Kapoor Neetu Chandra need this. They surely better things do. Or least, one surely better way making fool themselves. Geez, Sushmita Sen goes double personality screechy goodness sake! I'm told supposed laugh silliness. I would really silly. Every time something super-silly happens screen attempt justify give credibility. The struggle logic ludicrous won inane headache thrown extra. A quick example - everyone South Africa, yes including locals, understands speaks Hindi. And preparing snide remark character says other, "He hasn't learnt English, taught everyone village speak Hindi!" Why bother? You right. Why I even bother. Every movie I feel like writing one-liner asking watch movie finish off. This one them. But I impose upon duty explain I want keep away film. I feel responsible. Now film-makers felt fraction responsible.
