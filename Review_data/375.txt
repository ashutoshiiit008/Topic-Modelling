As I begin trip wrong side 35, I think lot old age. And every thought punctuated passing away "aged" person. People might say loud, death comes relief - person dies. Old age ailments anything anyone looks forward to. "Please don’t let live like vegetable," something I hear friends lot I’d like, even though it’s casual remark. But, if, don’t wait old age happen. What hit situation prime? That’s happens Ethan (Hrithik Roshan) Guzaarish. And Sanjay Leela Bhansali paints beautiful picture bring across pathos almost ignore silly basic plot is. The picture beautiful see thought gone composing frame; also writing lot restraint. Ethan doesn’t go spiel demanding sympathy. He gains situations he’s in. From fly can’t shoo anger can’t vent physically, make feel despair. Of course, mess end again, scene becomes tolerable hasn't used earlier. Yes, emotional triggers, visually, speech music. Well, it's supposed emotional scene, all. And Hrithik Roshan get promised amount screen time, right? But he, less, pulls off. Often, head dropped one side like mentally imbalanced person - got annoying, times showed unexpected degree talent. Including times got angry. It’s really fault went over-acting zone la Amitabh-Bachchan-in-Black. When two distinct personalities act mannerisms, one man directed blame. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan stomps Goan mansion dutifully. She breathtakingly beautiful. So perfect, I understand I hear people say, "she beautiful it's difficult like her." That doesn't make statement fair, again, it's unfair someone look divine too. (Sorry side, throughout film I reminded comment Guru's review commenter mentioned servant looked better Aishwary Rai, I guess Ethan can't even say that.) I admit, I didn't expect anything form acting anyone film. And I admit, I mildly surprised. Let alone Ms. Rai Bachchan hell, even Nafisa Ali bit voice modulation going around. I still get past Aditya Roy Kapoor's cute smile decide I really like acting not, far good. He refreshing air him. A bunch characters bit. And that's grouse. Almost come second half. I one, get unsettled characters base plot set new character introduced, let alone 4-5 new ones. Sure, purpose. But ever-lasting introduction characters, especially conflict comes first 10 minutes, threw story structure chart. I love experimentation, especially narrative styles, entry exit character character looked like writers filling blanks, "Oye, need love interest. Hey, family? Hey, enemy go? Oops, forgot give Sophia (Aishwarya) backstory. And on." And leading what? Because need clarify justify, meat goes missing. What wonderful opportunity story person appealing society kill him, Secondly, purpose Ethan's extra-ordinary character fight defeated decides I would do. His fight seems futile extent film too. But, point that, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's intentions clear first shot - one lyrical movement Aishwarya even something mundane drawing curtains. You know he's aiming brand grandeur. (And he'll stick one grand set, even Indian Judiciary system shift address.) You know purpose enchant visuals. And does. He doesn't want anything close real. Somewhere along side wants say story, I guess, must know too, plot priority. So, succeeds too. It's didn't work entirety. Meanwhile, create empathy. Smokers might able identify one better - someone else decided intervals took puffs smoking one cigarette?
