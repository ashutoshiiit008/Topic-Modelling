I admit - I restricted rating scale. A theatre screening Dhoom 2 want looking slick plot, well-defined characters quality acting. But, action-movie-buff enjoy watching good-looking people, certainly worth trip cinema halls. So, must, watch big screen. The cinematography spectacular, makes really want visit locations. There awesome creative action sequences. But sketchy, detailed. Explanations got how, least three sequences, deemed unnecessary. Some sub-plots outright silly outright unnecessary. The foot-tapping numbers treat eye, especially "Dil laga na". However, dances "Dhoom again" credits feel like high-level aerobics class choreography. Remember genre movie watching, songs don't need link story. A good action movie "has" thriller first (vice-versa necessary). Romance, comedy, melodrama come later. A smartly done action scenes stringed well choreographed songs good enough. Especially if, time between, going overdose Ekta Kapoor's soap opera style drama - two-second slow motion shots repeated thrice different angles - acceptable. Each five main characters dramatic entries couple get honour twice - annoying. Glaring product placements scenes looked like belonged trailer movie - test patience. Looks like effort went layers make-up Hrithik Roshan Aishwarya Rai Abhishek Bachchan Uday Chopra's dialogue delivery. Hrithik Aishwarya done best could done intense scenes. The rest movie Hrithik falls high places Aishwarya catwalks. The tanned Brazilian look suits Hrithik. Aishwarya's fresh look doesn't make look fresh, actually looks tired. Story-wise, Abhishek Uday start right stopped Dhoom. Abhishek doesn't need pull buttons look stylish. While over-acting settles first fifteen minutes screen time, don't look element. We seen much better them. Uday serves well comic relief Bipasha Basu eye-candy. What exactly function plot beyond me. Did casting director say, "We can't John movie, let's least Bipasha."? Watch Bipasha's excellent voice modulation, though. To me, action sake action. Even though done well, lack attention detail obvious.
