World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles painful action movie sit through. One films makes despair worthy newcomers industry - great scripts find producers - instead go mindless special effects bonanzas like one, name science fiction film. Trouble is, film takes seriously begin look Exit sign theatre. The film nothing 2-hour long action sequence, shot manner Barkha Dutt’s cameraman would shot Kargil War: running, ducking bombs lasers, absolutely aesthetics photography reason slow motion. Some may argue takes viewer centre action - believe does, laser bullets feel like they’re coming screen - would I want amongst bunch characters adhere terrible cliches American film casting (an Asian, African, Latin American, etc) possess nothing interesting boast of, even sense humour. The dialogue film mostly incomprehensible - common ones “Move!! Move!! Move!!”, ‘Watch out!!”. I get feeling sound design artist, responsible creating sounds gunshots bomb explosions, must charged - guessed right - bomb. Action overcomes everything else film, doesn’t even make lame attempt explaining logic. Americans known proud Armed forces - Marines - film another attempt glorifying role middle crisis. When world suddenly faced alien invasion, Captain Nantz (Aaron Eckhart, solid performance) platoon everything save bunch civilians Santa Monica, even major cities across world attacked meteor shower brings along aliens. Any sense whys hows invasion made clear edgy news reports - say colonization, say they’re water. All could depicted new character scientist/expert things, director Jonathan Liebesman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Darkness Falls) writer Christopher Bertolini (The General’s Daughter) decide skip formalities focus platoon instead. The result film characters shooting aliens, aliens more. Alien invasion films got new life couple years back, Peter Jackson produced District 9 - classy, made globally significant statements colonization, evacuation humanity, CNN-style again. But managed touch chord somewhere, developed characterisation docu-drama feel. It much believable. Heck, even aliens looked better designed. Which means, there’s always way make alien invasion movie interesting. Apocalypse great theme draw people theatres (2012 huge success India Rolland Emerich continues make movies theme) - want indulge one scary fantasy would feel like see world come end. Despite done death, success District 9 showed aliens still continue fascinate us, provided interesting characters there’s finesse involved making. World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles could won brownie points tried telling story eyes civilians - way, we’d got sense Americans love Marines much. We don’t know aliens look like, add quirks character design? This film’s aliens look plain ugly, spaceships becomes apparent much time thought spent them. This special effects film looks good begins - overhead shots coastline attack looks breathtaking, point novelty explosions wears you’re waiting film end. So I’m sarcastic best I say it’s great movie go for, date. The theatres empty.
