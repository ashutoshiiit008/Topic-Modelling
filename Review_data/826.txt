Yes, certainly rehash A good men. The context Indianized effectively. And despite including Indian movie-making elements like melodrama, out-of-context absolutely-unnecessary songs, difficult-to-digest climax, etc. The Rob Reiner courtroom drama characters, Shaurya issue trying highlight. I would say best way appreciate latter blocking former. After all, even Kay Kay Menon Jack Nickolson, still Kay Kay Menon. Not impossible. Give try. Most first half spent building characters hardly know fact two case, army lawyer Major Siddhant (Rahul Bose), handle. Very deliberately then, movie moves strong point wants make - egos people power need punished misusing power dominate minorities (women, religious minorities, etc). This is, course, done using one minorities case point. But general application confirmed read various cases principle applied. It takes courage needs done. In mind, takes courage cast Jaaved Jaaferi non-slapstick role. It's earth-shattering performance, mere exchange glances showcases man capable of. Rahul Bose casual-cum-sincere demeanor makes believe transformation character goes despite gaps script. That feel like slapping Brigadier Rudra Pratap Singh overconfidence high-strung attitude, says Kay Kay Menon. Now, overacting reserved women, beyond me. Of course, I asking men overact too. But, really makes wonder kind women moviemakers lives? They get shrill express excitement (Minissha Lamba) exaggeratedly listless sad (Seema Biswas). Besides that, Shaurya's characters become believable way etched shaded-in dialogues given. Each character strongly opinionated rarely one choose lecture audience. The conversational tone might lot camera angles compositions chosen. Tight close-ups speaking person frame noticeably avoided. This makes look like dialogue rather monologue even though relatively long monologues throughout movie. Other coverage scenic beauty, editing, background music average. Abrupt cuts disctracting. And loud compositions ever work displaying character's internal conflicts? Had things bit better, Shaurya would crispier, tighter output. Nevertheless, story dialogues supporting story strong enough make case one.
