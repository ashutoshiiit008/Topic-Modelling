Consistency - Dhamaal lacks. A hold-my-stomach-and-laugh situations sewn together regular loud, slapping-around slapstick. And this, story writers kind enough worry well-being, literally begging gray cells take break. Some gags sadly derived jokes I first heard I ten, deleting e-mail forwards last ten years. On hand though, caricatures side-side-characters outright hilarious acted really well too. You give credit creating atmosphere general interest throughout movie. Within first fifteen minutes know matter lead characters plan, going fall flat face (not literally, thank goodness!) But, manner fall pretty creative times. Unfortunately, second half sees playing catch-up five characters to. The structure story becomes amount editing could create flow narration. The performances mix good, bad ugly too. Riteish Deshmukh Javed Jaffrey added nuances characters comic timing. Sanjay Dutt Ashish Chowdhary looked plain disinterested. One doesn't expect less Asrani slapstick - screaming written soon know name starcast. Here shocker - Arshad Warsi takes cue Asrani - heart-breaking that! Did anyone notice - female lead! Ain't great!? We know could easily misused movie genre. No women also usually make songs pretty much boring. The plain-as-ever lyrics lackluster music don't help. Not mention ridiculous choreography resultant indifference cast executed it. What waste Javed Jaffrey! The background music make certain situations funnier. But then, got bit much annoying used every single movement character object. There certainly good laughs packed two hours - twenty minutes worth. But good enough forgive tolerable, miscellaneous comedy? On lazy Sunday afternoon, DVD remote control hand - yes.
