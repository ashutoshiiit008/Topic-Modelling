There escaping undeniable truth; use personal computer smartphone – matter brand operating system – means life touched Steve Jobs. And two many, many fields technology, innovation creativity man indelible impact on. Considering charisma, phenomenal graph story, anecdotes myths surround sheer legend became life death, would seem making terrific biopic would breeze. Well, apparently not. Joshua Michael Stern’s screen adaptation life times Steve Jobs bit mess. A superficial account one iconic contemporary figures, proceeds like soulless, humourless recounting key incidents moments Jobs’ life, without ever pausing give viewer even ounce insight actually made man tick; drove push everyone around churn best innovate, electronic gadgets, life extensions. Yes, Steven Jobs visited India early life, started Apple Computer garage, forced quit company co-founded returned grand fashion turned around make Apple valuable company world. Stern writer Matt Whiteley seem said themselves, “We know this. Let’s make film!” When even read, hear talk Steve Jobs, you’re usually enthralled, impressed, confounded inspired. It seems strange think filmmakers, every audio-visual tool disposal evoke emotions viewers, fail character that, countless experiences life, seems tailor-made one multiple screen portrayals. The key problem Jobs choices – include film, treat it, narrative must structured – seems like none paid thought attention to. Like rest us, makers film assumed Steve Jobs would power film through. Clearly, film subtracts great man, rather adding persona manner. Considering Ashton Kutcher always suspect choice play Steve Jobs – he’s never really able break away Kelso – thing least makes wait till end film. His physical transformation remarkable, even though doesn’t nearly capture essence Steve Jobs. His expressions – pursed smile, pursed frown, pursed everything – give impression trying hard ‘be’. That becomes even apparent gangly gait often shown film. Every side character film merely functional. Kutcher earns film brownie points, nothing take away fact Jobs one disappointing films recent times, particularly considering fact I actually really intrigued trailer film. The good news, course, still Aaron Sorkin’s version look forward to. Perhaps person disappointed Jobs would Steve Jobs himself. For someone whose key mantra innovation, description banal treatment life story would probably one word always seemed likely say. Sh*t.
