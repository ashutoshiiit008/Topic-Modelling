Bittoo Boss feels like vehicle approaching end life. It troubles taking off, giving sinking feeling it's going run all. Then suddenly kick-starts, looks like could give mileage, jerks stalls finally dying you. Given Bittoo Boss wants awaken audience vanity porn industry, narrative uses alternately decent preachy. And latter gets annoying, mention happens two amateur leap frog-ish, jumping point A point B without using reasonably understandable flow. For example, way lead lady, Mrinalini (Amita Pathak) falls love unconvincing time happens - ins outs. Similarly, man Bittoo's (Pulkit Samrat) choice career change rather sudden given ideologies thus far. Yet, happens this, tiny bit unpredictable typically hero whose self-respect hurt name money, would usually fall prey no-nos realizing it's him. But Bittoo rather self-aware comparison. This pleasant surprise wriggles way smoothly even little easily. There something Pulkit Samrat didn't gel well promos, sort-of grows Ranveer Singh, la Band Baaja Baaraat kind-of way. Except hair, even though brain told often enough that's lad interiors thinks he's cool, would think cool. There moments second half Pulkit shows care characters warmth eyes. That sudden face, totally different issue. Amrita Pathak, acted well, also constantly reminded struggle unhappy good-looking people lead sit 2+ hours looking not-so good-looking people part audience. The problem also, lady doesn't screen presence could covered non-glamorous persona has. The quirky cabbie-cum-assistant Bittoo enrolls second half looks awful yet awesome screen presence. That actor (name anyone? - Ashok Pathak, thanks information Pradeep!) one takeaways Bittoo Boss, despite sleazy. Another takeaway, subtle way Bittoo Boss tries point lot beyond sex goes bedroom crux emotions lie. And sex innocent expression all. Agree disagree, pretty insightful thing film try say. Unfortunately, Bittoo Boss also ends getting preachy it. That goes haywire last twenty minutes sorts-of new dimensions added mix. Moreover, entire film misses zing, energy (that shows first song) hold attention. wogma presents ''Bittoo ne le li" contest association Bollywood Fashion. Bittoo ko lene photo, tum tshirt jeeto!
