A social commentary four contemporary topics without getting sermons, amazing experience. It's non-judgmental makes feel characters. Each story beautifully scripted don't really care linked not. Nor bother don't know fit timeline. You willing go flow take matter-of-factly character one story appears another one without specific purpose. All matters characters going through. Afia wants mother, can't find man, she'll get donor. Everyone around thinks gone nuts want root her. Megha bitter, don't mind resentment uprooted homeland cruel fashion. How feel Abhimanyu molested child, even though turned person doesn't mind using people around him. And Omar well, story story mistreatment afforded towards homosexuality rather character. You feel confused actors, see dilemma pain. If stubborn want give benefit doubt. The treatment given story consistent smooth flow. That must achievement considering involved different teams working them. Of course, times feel like parts you'd like know about. For example, Afia's story feels complete. But obviously topic broad situation people Kashmir, Megha's half-hour much justice. It still doesn't take away beauty feel bad friend Rubina. Abhimanyu's story also painted broadly again, I'm sure whether want know/see gory details, especially coming along many heavy issues. Same goes Omar's homosexuality. The logistics unclear don't know much want hear. All makes think one deserved little time, maybe even film each. But stands, serious short films, brilliant performances, well-shot executed. A worthy watch, need get serious mode.
