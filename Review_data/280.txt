Makers slapsticks suffer huge superiority complex. By slapstick, I mean, ""ball hits balls" again" kind "comedy". And makers' arrogance transparent. Obviously intelligent people. They raised finances dumb product. And yet condescending attitude towards audience. Or maybe, money knowing it, requires two different types intellect. Even so, know fact Arshad Warsi, Riteish Deshmukh, Jaaved Jaaferi AND Sanjay Dutt capable much more. Heck, even Ashish Chaudhury better job overacting this. And yet, chose film. They couldn't out-of-work, could they? Miss Cleavage-Kangna-Cleavage-Ranaut-Cleavage Mallika Sherawat better job guys, imagine that! Well, again, that's relative. The thing film plot huge potential funny. Four good-for-nothings trying out-smart smart aleck ex-cop. But going get least bit creative characters, I supposed get interested? Save Maanav (Jaaved Jaaferi), three good-for-nothings distinguishing characters. They mimick, role-play, pull-off disguise. Even though disguises well done could actually conceal identity, changed identities remained pretty much same. Why three different characters? Oh, much money know it, I forgot. If didn't feel need work plot characters, least should've tried get laugh two us, right? Whole eggs crack mouth, guy chews boxer's naada (the string holds boxer shorts up) - make squeeze eyes close I taste disgust. In sense then, I could feel characters felt. Sigh Neither umpteen references films actors industry reach funny bone. There slight comment makers want make babas (spiritual gurus) better worse goons underworld. But, whole sub-episode loud couldn't bother subtext. On hand, film try laugh itself. There's comment foursome, "they look like crooks" That true. All four look straight goon-factory - shady repulsive. Then two scenes Sanjay Dutt makes "I don't patience anymore" expression, mimicking what's running audience's minds exact points. Yet cannot forgive taking fool. Another film takes audience granted. Another one would make lousy sms forwards interesting supposed smart-quips. Another one skip enjoy monsoons.
