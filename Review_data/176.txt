What would got stuck box? And no, I trying revive melo-dramatic scene Guzaarish, Hrithik Roshan tries explain someone metaphorical sense helpless. This literally stuck box fit. It’s dark, cold, dirty idea ended there. Ryan Reynolds Buried spends 95 mins box – buried alive trying desperately figure way get out. Be warned, film meant claustrophobic. I started watching movie fan switched light sweatshirt. When I done, I tense, room felt like oven even fan on. My bed felt small I compulsively walk around remind space around me. And I’m even claustrophobic. Ryan Renolds Paul Conroy plays truck driver based Iraq wakes buried coffin. How ends coffin, he’s unaware. All remembers hit head, waking pitch darkness box big dimensions. The first 5 mins film dark. You can’t see anything; hear heavy breathing uncontrollable fidgeting. More once, I fought urge forward film point I could see something. Even Reynolds brings light zippo lighter, it’s flickering troubled. You’re frustrated feel like pulling screen bringing room! We learn box equipped phone kidnappers make contact demand ransom. This disturbing introduction followed frantic calls loved ones, FBI, 911 America – make hold, take time comprehend situation. The frustrated get, Buried pulls strings. Just hopeful might find way out, something goes wrong. The sense fear interpreted superbly director Rodrigo Cortes writer Chris Sparling. How much one work around idea man stuck box, anyway? You never feel sense stuck, ironically. Buried allows keep hoping whatever Conroy planning work out. You go drill spooked out, even speaks various people phone, kicks, screams cries, something always keeps hopeful get – it’s gripping series events. Not much innovation could brought photography yet lighting minimalistic effective. The extreme close-ups half eye stubble-beard give exact sense lack space frame. Ryan Reynolds plays part helpless person caught messy political situation. Why him, ask? How relevant anybody gain burying insignificant truck driver? It’s questions manage fuel frustration viewer. What I love Buried back story offered – it’s plain simple. Paul Conroy needs escape, tries to, makes film. The features Blu-ray rather brief informative. We learn film used 7 coffins shoot, coffins one side opened. Director Rodrigo Cortes mentions filming difficult shot 17 days. There deleted scenes, commentary filming process interview director pretty much gives insight making. As afterthought, Buried could crisper. It tend get repetitive bits, melodramatic reactions Renolds’ part. But sheer courage make film like 17 days able spook viewer extent fast-forwarding becomes option, Buried must-watch. However, please remember catch breath every then.
