ABCD - Anybody Can Dance Gopi (Ganesh Acharya) tease Vishnu (Prabhu Deva) "You want make Lagaan?", Vishnu expresses he'll train good-for-nothings slum area compete TV dance show. Within context, funny. As movie progresses realize Remo D'Souza actually made Lagaan cum ChakDe! India cum 3 Idiots. Unfortunately, terms quality narrative, terms themes touched upon. This actually wanted ABCD - Anybody Can Dance express love dance. Also, many choreographers interested making film dancing, can't full-blown musical? Unfortunately, dances come across aerobic gymnastic routines, little yoga thrown in. Except extravaganza end, it's true spectacle. Isn't dance lot grace able contort body twists turns. For joy watching dance, I'd happily watch Madhuri Dixit elegance Sri Devi mimic Michael Jackson, even it's half minute. Fortunately, hand, I knew expect. So, fan Prabhu Deva kind dancing, treat. Even lot sequences look like might inspired something already done elsewhere. However, I would think showcase actual talent dancing, shouldn't many long shots? Sure, final dance spectacular, yet nowhere close one F.A.L.T.U Aaja Nachle. Also, F.A.L.T.U much story ABCD - Anybody Can Dance. While twists end added element surprise, fail tug heart way could have. There much dance showcased room characters build connect you. At least, enough go beyond obvious good vs evil. Other too, things I liked ABCD's story - tight slap father son, fact Vishny eventually love interests distract us main story. But, typical character turn-arounds end nullify things going ABCD. However, ABCD taken display current-day dancing, quite enjoyable. If only, stuck title. When say Anybody Can Dance, I would wanted people like me, two left feet extremely conscious it, dance. But, it's ultimately, people dance, dance.
