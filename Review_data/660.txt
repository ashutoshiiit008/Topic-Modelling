In general, I like movies strong compelling story. Once though, comes along movie like ‘The Namesake’ direction, screenplay importantly - acting make forget story ‘nothing spectacular’. And despite fact relatively slow paced. The story doubt truthful authentic narration average NRI family moved abroad 70s - locations sets accents reactions various characters. Especially, Tabu Irrfan lose heavy Bangla accent gradually years go by. This could also mean people haven’t lived outside India extended period time might identify characters. They enjoy narrative nevertheless. While characters Ashima (Tabu) Ashoke (Irrfan Khan) sketched quite detail played beautifully, parts Gogol’s (Kal Penn) character seemed superficial, especially love life. By standards, Tabu movie way. The lady gracefully ages daughter wife mother. It amazing one movement eye, know exactly character feeling. However, since movie tries close reality possible, missing nuances bothered couple times two hours. I must admit I haven’t read book, could one things didn’t find way movie. High emotions jerking tears along way, one worth watch performances. The beauty lies depth relationships touched upon. This one rare occasions story told consumes audience rather story itself. Update: Corrected spelling mistake - 'Ashim' replaced 'Ashima'. Thanks Ashima (Comment #1 notepad).
