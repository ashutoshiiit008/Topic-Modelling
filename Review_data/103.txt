As skeleton, Aurangzeb comes across Don justification behind sudden appearance underworld personality's look-alike. A look-alike willing take Don's place Police spy. But add flesh complications turbulences said justification brings along engaging, intriguing thriller. If only, little less flat narration. It's ages since I seen film worked hard story; terms overall twists turns bringing human factor relationships. That theme rundown underworld vs cops one. Of course, Aurangzeb that. It dwells themes father-son relationship many angles. Interestingly, doesn't dwell much characters individually. Maybe don't get involved could been. Also later, film end resorting common thing gangster movie move story ahead - kill someone. In sense, one particular murder place throws Aurangzeb 'decent watch' categaory instead 'must watch'. Otherwise, till particular event, film fact, surprises unpredictability. The change hearts, once, seem plausible. Motivations main players clear enough behave way do. And course, performances make events seem believable otherwise. Arjun Kapoor plays twin brothers, Ajay Vishal well. He expresses angst turmoil well, however goes little flat express characters' softer side. Fortunately, Aurangzeb doesn't need show mellow shades characters long. You actor double role good job yet someone much smaller role outshine him. If guess name, Rishi Kapoor one people list. Even so, Agneepath, performance shouldn't surprise us all. Prithviraj Sukumar remains cool solemn-face self throughout teased screen wife too. Amruta Singh induces slap-worthy performance good character invokes despise. Even two-minute role, Anupam Kher's face stayed back me. Yet, I glad didn't add bits back-story sake it. Similarly, welcome relief see snazzy bits added in, make 'commercially viable'. Whether name item numbers terms action sequences. Even means narration feels drab movie progresses. Aurangzeb one little surprises makes look forward director's next venture, even aren't completely satisfied served time. Just thought put story, making otherwise done-to-death theme interesting, Aurangzeb worth watch.
