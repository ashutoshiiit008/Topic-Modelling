It’s youthful yet elegant. It’s contemporary yet identifiable with, anyone who’s tiff close one. Yes, layers love rock music issues related urban life need peeled off. But core it’s simple story told compassion sophistication. That doesn’t mean questions answered. The details main conflict left imagination. But, manner drawn story shows smart people involved making. So, I submitted myself, albeit grudgingly, fact heart bringing us resolution clash. I’d suggest same. Whenever I complain cliché predictability movies/stories, I question myself, bad thing? How could avoided situation? But, I end one answer - depends done. Is natural, flow? Is nature flow convincing? The obvious call events Rock on!! worked I found getting attached characters relatively ordinary lives. (Even though characters followed spotlights half faces!) Each character foursome representative kind people group friends has. The idealist whose self-respect resign compromise (Arjun Rampal), slightly self-centered one can’t see falters (Farhan Akhtar), easy-go-lucky-cum-jackass doesn’t let anything bother much (Purab Kohli) one who’s emotionally attached ‘group’ sentiment rest (Luke Kenny). The slight shiver Farhan’s hands confronted past, made gape awe actor also director, Abhishek Kapoor. Unbelievable man’s last effort appalling Aryan. Same goes Arjun looked like holding back dialogues keep moustache falling. Even so, I found cheering came take final bow. Purab Luke didn’t necessarily greatest body language yet, felt bad things shaping going tough. With male-bonding central theme, it’s refreshing see women well thought characters influence direction story. Prachi Desai strong yet vulnerable Sakshi. You feel like shaking man consciousness he’s ignoring despite anxiety eyes convey. You sympathize Debbie’s frustration Shahana Goswami strongly brings across. We see getting pulled narrative writer, Abhishek Kapoor, given characters detailed attention. Together, mature smoothly adolescent “we conquer world” enthusiasm learning live life hard way. And yet, even two less important roles (Purab Luke) defining qualities restricted protagonists’ “inner voice”. Moreover, done good humor. Writer, Abhishek also shown imaginative strokes. The onscreen performances actors mirror status characters band throughout movie. Almost rock band’s chemistry shared four actors. Also, despite parallel narration two time-spans, rarely event seem place. A plausible complaint could made run-time pace movie. I would argue tampering would take away poise charm experience. * Note music: My exposure rock music negligible. I recently educated rock-enthusiast lyrics plain factual rock music. The focus music. This conversation obviously came I complaining lyrics Rock On!! appreciating different music was. I’m still convinced lyrics highlighted loud clear pronunciation, focus, especially less lame. “aasmaan kyon neela, paani kyon geela geela” would sound great kids’ song like “bum bum bhole“, didn’t work here. (Why’s sky blue, water wet? It’d alright lines least sounded poetic like “Why’s sky blue, water full dew?”) Songs “Zindaggi Rocks” awesome lyrics; qualify rock, then? Anyway, I’m going buy CD music grow me. Oh yeah, stick around till last title card shows up.
