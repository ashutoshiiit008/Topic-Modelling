Imagine visiting friend relative happen invited group friends. You audience sitting corner observing people interact react other. You know bits pieces lives exposed prejudices vulnerabilities. Karma aur Holi worried pace. It doesn't look rushed especially considering it's covering 10-odd characters 90 minutes. And movie covers many characters usually jumps one's story another one certain flow. That happening one house might contributed feel. Because it's like audience walking one room another. Also long-long time characters accents felt real. The casting perfect. The gorgeous Sushmita Sen perfect charming hostess, Mira. She juggles diplomatic firm like home-maker would do. Randeep Hooda, Mira's husband trying run business sticking guns. And whole range characters various age groups ethnicities. I particularly enjoyed Rati Agnihotri's performance jittery, intolerant, middle-aged mother teenager. The teenage son pretty good too! And I almost wanted counsel Suchitra Krishnamurty's character suppressed wife break shackles run life. One character wouldn't missed would voiceover narrator! He redundant. As usual, stories feel desperate need resolution character. And desperation shows. Thankfully though closure threads forced. Except Rati Agnihotri-Suresh Oberoi angle. The transformation absolutely unwarranted left 'this happens films' feel. And yet despite things good Karma aur Holi, 'no big deal' attached it. The holi suburban New York background nothing really. The characters similar either us someone know. That gives real feel also doesn't make anything spectacularly special.
