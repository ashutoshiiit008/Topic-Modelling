A bomb blasts, disturbed. You want something feel helpless lost. We rant it, complain administration. Bloggers blog it. And filmmakers, well, least make films present point view. D-Day ultimately, comes across filmmakers rant. Writer-director Nikhil Advani sets characters rather dull manner. You know sad stories, don't really care them, till interval point. At break time, twist suddenly makes wonder happen characters. Thereafter though, instead piquing build-up, narrative flattens. The pace action film slackens moments reflections characters. This shame turmoil male lead characters played really well. Thematically, starts wonderful editing R&AW mission song wedding. But, treatment juxtaposed film's larger theme, pace becomes uneven. Uneven writing doesn't help cause. Loyalties change; enemies find others' moves companions; incredible happens, nowhere. Towards end, D-Day comes across fantasy ought happen real world trying keep real. Interestingly, climax seems talking simultaneously administration ought terrorists warning could capable of. And going go well audience? A capable Irrfan Khan flat-but-effective performance Arjun Rampal D-Day's high points. Rishi Kapoor whatever he's asked ease. Unfortunately, character isn't menacing enough give room instill fear. Huma Qureshi barely makes presence felt. You really wonder reason equal representation spy team, included. Shruti Haasan, hand, better, meaningful role. Interestingly, performance seems effective shorter lines. Beyond line two accent begins falter, makes distracting. The number songs, even play background many slow proceedings considerably. The film lingers much action film. Post-interval, plot goes haywire editing loses grip except sequences. Even wonderful sequences, stretches bit longer optimum - enough make impatient. D-Day wants stylish take psyche martyrs country also trying make larger point terrorism ought handled. And, also wants thriller. Too much one plate.
