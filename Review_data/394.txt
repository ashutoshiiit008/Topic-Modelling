I gifted DVD Head On brother wedding anniversary, discover returned week later, stating wife didn’t regard ‘wedding anniversary’ gift. This surprised me. I’d enjoyed watching Head On. However, bro returned it, I watched again, wearing ‘wedding anniversary’ lens. And I realised bhabhi right. It didn’t mean Head On good film – it’s despite story married couple’s relationship, setting many would find intense uncomfortable. In fact, without destruction violence bring upon themselves, passions run Cahit Sibel love other, commands envy. Set Turkey, Head On Cahit, 40-yr old hot-tempered divorcee, attempts suicide land rehab meets Sibel, proposes marry immediately. Not wants married, parents want Turkish groom. This promise ‘room-mates’ marriage, marks beginning life, spins wildly control, independent identities overlap sense married. Akin’s treatment film like ballad. An orchestra, beautifully perched banks Bosphorus river Istanbul starts film makes appearances key moments, deepening understanding story. This helps us see Cahit Sibel characters tale, rather look identify with. At times, feel sorry couple, thinking tried, could make things much better. At times, cheer them, discover sparks simply marriage convenience. Cahit addict, bad temper sometimes bed women. Sibel, hand dream room-mate have, cooks really well, cleans room, insists hitting dance floor often, doesn’t mind hooking night first good looking man finds. These traits draw Cahit Sibel closer other, also disrupt lives permanently. The film’s music one biggest strengths. Akin uses well (reminds Dev D). Both Cahit Dev drink like fish, drugs, show anger violence keep rooms extremely dirty. The similarities end there. Akin, interview DVD, says immensely inspired people like Kurt Cobain James Dean. Indeed, self-destructive characters, depicted directs Cahit Sibel. Both Birol Unnel (Cahit) Sibel Kekilli (Sibel) give oustanding performances. Head On disturbing gory, makes inhibition showing violent love. But one film want revisit, relive passions rarely see relationships days. Some may mistake Akin’s story love first sight, fact, impulsive choices consequences go beyond control.
