Steve Martin back Inspector Jacques Clouseau Pink Panther 2, seems really ridiculous attempt keep franchise going. Right onset, I must confess I great fan Steve Martin. Yes, I seen films; Sgt Bilko, The Father Bride names come mind. I also seen Planes, Trains, Automobiles well Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. As films I enjoyed last two more, primarily John Candy Michael Caine respectively, acting them. But Steve Martin never really left impression respect comic abilities. The role bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau initially played great comic genius, Peter Sellers, five films, directed Blake Edwards. Some films really funny, Sellers great form, French Detective. So difficult watch Steve Martin enact character compare Seller’s version, even though one knows comparisons might prove inherently unfair. (I believe Steve Martin crying hoarse saying played Clouseau Sellers would done, instead interpreted differently). The plot shopworn reworking earlier Pink Panther films. The supporting cast fine actors likes Andy Garcia, Alfredo Molina, Lily Tomlin, Jean Reno, heaven help us, Jeremy Irons. They absolutely nothing film except look foolish irritated alternate intervals. Yes, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan too, Sonia, mainly kept background. John Cleese plays Dreyfuss, Clouseau’s boss (a role made famous Herbert Lom original Pink Panther films) completely wasted too. The screenplay really lets film down; extremely predictable seems consist gags. When tries things, ends creating character Mrs. Berenger (played Lily Tomlin) tries teach Clouseau political correctness. This could basis whole set witty dialogues / situations parodying today’s world, no, get instead banal boring situations. Steve Martin struts around series set piece slapstick gags, gags flat insipid. There single gag makes laugh hilariously; Martin Pope, Martin choosing wine, Martin investigating large mansion, Martin flamenco dancer, Martin practicing karate side kick’s children (another reworking original Peter Seller’s films), comes across extremely labored. The irritating thing Martin accent; Sellers, faux French accent hilarious, Martin equivalent red, itchy rash one would like get rid post haste. Martin maintains immobile visage, face frozen something pout sneeze. The climax hackneyed rest movie, Martin jumping dodging various objects. Slapstick routines require terrific physicality Buster Keaton Charlie Chaplin; Martin unfortunately it. He also superb timing, confidence, varied body language Peter Sellers' Clouseau had; neither Martin master disguise. Martin comes across total chump busy clowning around desperately order attract attention. (Or interpretation Clouseau?) The film total bummer; sounds laughter bunch ten year olds theatre. I would like think laughed loudest Martin getting worst it. Need anything said? PS It pleasure hear theme music again: saving grace film excellent background score Christophe Beck.
