I forgot…I knew Priyadarshan movie…and yet I forgot carry cotton stuff ears. Of course, everything loud, expected. Not mention added bonus I would received, listen oh-so-pathetic dialogues. What I didn’t forget though, Priyadarshan mentioned one interviews, “No one brains watch Bhagam Bhag”. Honestly, I listened him, I left brains home. Believe me, I looking logic single scene, let alone movie whole. I didn’t realize I look forward good laughs comedy! The absurdity make laugh either. I refuse accept audience expected laugh Akshay Kumar’s face stuck two half-naked hairy butts. The line made laugh hard dig Bunty (Akshay Kumar) takes Akshay Kumar real-life actor. And I smile one forgettable scenes Akshay Kumar Govinda. That laugh half. No amount decent acting Akshay Kumar, Govinda, Paresh Rawal’s could save movie. The train thoughts going mind watching movie….Can’t blame dialogue writer try find way justice shoddy screenplay. Almost sub-plots could cut-and-pasted order would similar product….But, screenplay’s fault contrive adjoin five stories nothing other?....Nope, certainly cannot point fingers director zilch work with….Oops.…they done people – dialogues, screenplay, story (ies), direction….Hey! The audience supposed dumb, makers. With control, surely capable coming something better. This one rare movies wait song, however irrelevant. You want characters stop talking! Indeed, songs welcome relief. ‘signal’ ‘tere bin’ good music. Sameer added new set list rhyming words ‘afreen – nazneen - dilnasheen’. As always, words come rhyming words matter. It exasperating cannot enjoy movie even give brain vacation. Such movies don’t make laugh, make angry!
