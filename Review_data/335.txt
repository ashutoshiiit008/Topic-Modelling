You tell writers Fukrey love characters joy see writers invested characters. Except get carried away. The introduction slow even fun quirkiness sets in, literally jerked drowsiness. The character exposition tardy lacklustre wonder going spend next two hours. And good see writers care deeply audience's understanding characters, don't go beyond initial set-up. As movie develops, don't really discover anything new, let alone interesting characters. However, movie progresses couple characters get element bring life film, Chucha (Varun Sharma) Bholi Punjabi (Richa Chaddha). Their characters' quirks language use add zing film. That Chucha uses dreams win lotteries combined outlandish sense humor, gradually wake begin expect peak film's comedy. Bholi's brash lady-goon reminds Neha Dhupia's Munni gangster Phas Gaya Re Obama happy enjoying role better. She seems home language mannerisms. Yet, two characters actors perform take movie far. Also ultimately, movie wants become greater far forces message in. In addition, fact main characters pretty much losers don't feel much identify with. Sure, two characters take away lot credit, actors great job too. Especially women, Vishakha Singh Priya Anand. I especially enjoyed scenes Priya Anand Pulkit Samrat communicate eyes. Hilarious romantic moments time. Also,though Pankaj Tripathi's role seems small warrant actor calibre, course, well has. Yet, that's going well Fukrey, 2.5+ hours, lot isn't. There isn't enough warrant trip theaters. Finally, I'll always remember Fukrey film started guy peeing cracking toilet joke. Even so, film director writer tried. A DVD watch skip first half sounds like it.
