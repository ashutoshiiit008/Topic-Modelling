You see screen might read morning cup coffee. Except it's less fictitious feels closer reality paid-for articles offered mainstream media. (Unless course, rely twitter timeline daily dose news.) Love Sex Aur Dhokha cinema uncinematic life really is. Because reality, love might easy cakewalk narrated YRF Films true either. A DDLJ-type love due credit, comment voyeuristic nature, sting operation make us introspect society live in. Superficially, none three short films exactly ordinary. But something story, director/writer Dibakar Banerjee narrating. Yes, Rahul-Shruti's story spoof happy cinema. And I issued I I spoofy films add nothing new use excuse parody exactly mocking at. Yeah, also jeers films made Bollywood - story disregarded, etc. We've seen quite bit that. So, there's nothing new there.

Had links one story picked characters story, one could not-so-dark. There fourth element film silent cannot shake - camera. The camera left around, almost presence pure coincidental, accidental. I imagine much thought must gone making camera-placement look casual. That non-traditional lighting set dark tone film, course justified nature stories. What traditional though, marketing technique deployed. The use word 'sex' arouse curiosity create aura sensuousness nothing publicity gimmick. Anyone going expecting even soft-porn going seriously disappointed. And Banerjee-saaheb, et tu? An item number closing credits? Yeah, yeah, yeah…spoof jazz. Love Sex Aur Dhokha watchable decipher comment us individuals society. There plenty that. It something go see ace-class production values. Nor seeing something different.
