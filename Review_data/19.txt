I've grown fighting fears reciting Hanuman Chalisa. Over time I grew person believes God doesn't need praise take care me. I believe He exists that's I need know. Yet I respect find peace mind performing rituals. BUT, followers one religion try even imply religion superior another, I lose respect them. And that's happened 1920. I couldn't believe one religion succeeds something couldn't! So much I feel like taking points away repulsive yet thrill-inducing quivers successfully got way climax. The finale though, completely ruined whatever building towards, lame offensive. Sure, movie taken man's journey losing regaining faith. But cost demeaning someone else's belief - unacceptable! There isn't special craft involved writing two distinct stories make movie either. Unrequited love undying love brings havoc redeems soul respectively. There creative lines strewn around nothing remarkable effort whole. Just deadpan expressions lead actors, Rajneesh Duggal Adah Sharma, haggard pace beginning bring yawn, story began inching forward. And I complete awe many ways Adah's body managed contort, turn, wiggle, squirm. Her facial muscle movements, make-up, special effects contributed disgust I felt towards ghost possessing sorry I felt character. Rajneesh's face eyes hand remained blank. Points consistency? The things I knew movie beforehand it's set almost century ago, belongs horror genre. Horror translates shrill background music weird camera work, I prepared that. But, I pleasantly surprised. In fact opening sequence little music accompaniment. An eerie ambience created, alright. Yet, didn't escape standard questions one would ever-predictable Hindi horror movies. How come person turns dissatisfied enough death invariably resides mansion? What stops ghost getting mansion? In particular case wasn't ghost attached mansion? I guess, haunted mansion makes movie-worthy material haunted shanty. But, main glaring, making fume question remains - How? How one make insensitive movie religion it's used commit many atrocities serve God-alone-knows-what agenda? Freedom expression, huh? Irresponsible usage - I say...
