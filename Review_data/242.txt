First time director Marcel Langenegger gets together two A list actors, Hugh Jack man Ewan McGregor film aspires Noir thriller. Visuals city streets night, skyscrapers lit like Christmas candles, plush hotel rooms cloaked anonymous neon, unfortunately noir film make. What film like requires clever, well developed script, believable characters. There three main characters: nerdy accountant leads life dull colorless watching numbers scroll laptop gives biggest thrill (there horrible line says order symmetry, really!). A cool, smooth, assured man world oh fit physical. And femme fatale, golden blond locks, long legs, pouty mouth. The characters remain superficial; script help us understand peculiar idiosyncrasies motivations. They seem specifically brought life film could made. The first part film accountant man world coming together, obvious screenplay twist made account transformation accountant’s world. And gets worse, every cliché played out, film rambles towards climax. Now, director could kept short taut, climax is. Unfortunately undecided whether wrap things neatly; throw revenge angle, feel good ending. He ends little bit everything, really spoils all. The climax unconvincing, feels stretched. A good noir film works transports everyday characters world obvious; world lurks around next corner mean streets city. For script good build create characters believe in. Here caricatures rather characters, wrecks film. Both Jackman Ewan McGregor seem done film money nothing else. The actress playing femme fatale nothing look good alternate tears laughter. The good thing see delightful Charlotte Rampling screen brief cameo. I wonder there, though!
