I wonder ghost/witch story is, default, good vs. evil (pun intended) story. Ek Thi Daayan tries underline further, possible. The able cast gripping first hour, unfortunately, can't much dwindling, unwieldy second hour. Yet, typical Hindi horror film, manage get nervous times. The first half lovely build-up indeed. It interesting see creative interpretation child. I also loved way keeps hanging child's imagination don't want believe it. Even so, connect characters missing. You don't know supposed feel cool magician seems disturbed hallucinations. You don't know care couple. The backstory comes, little late go back feelings characters. Also, whatever emotional attachment made children whose safety involved. But, doesn't last long. Yet, gripped situation backstory. Another major contributor keeping rooted seat cast. All main leads kids Emraan Hashmi perform well. Can't say supporting actors, especially Pawan Malhotra Rajatava Dutta. The kids hand Vishesh Tiwari plays young Bobo (Emraan Hashmi) younger sister behave like children would always refreshing see films. Thankfully, one thing come Konkana Sen Sharma's haunting face. As much credit makeup special effects department naturally beautiful eyes use them. Emraan Hashmi gets play quintessential spooked guy, horror film. So gets spooked, alright. Huma Qureshi less plain role whatever little it. Kalki Koechlin smallest roles all, creates intrigue consistent. The inconsistency reserved last hour film comes random songs even worse twists. At end film, sub-plots make wonder found place film all. On hand, themes touched upon left half-done, like child's dreamy world, struggle good bad logic faith. And usual horror films, don't witches ghosts go directly kill, instead trying warm subject killing random people associated subject rather subject themselves. In sense then, Ek Thi Daayan like horror film. Thankfully, varies tries stay clear standard mechanisms horrifying - loud background score, etc. It also creep every while. If only, climax interval point.
