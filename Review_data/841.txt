An abused flat, visually filthy sense stink must carry. But, must also feel like abundant luxury someone prison. The word 'prison' brings dark images mind even without heavy bluish-gray tinge given Siddharth - The Prisoner. These first few, short lingering sequences bring mood melancholy doesn't go away. While soaking bits Siddharth's (Rajat Kapoor's) newfound freedom can't help notice background music. The keys typewriter tapping along notes piano. A string instrument joins later waiting tinkering bell make rhythm complete. And pause score abrupt seems part music itself. And soon music becomes repetitive enough blend elements doesn't distract. A lot able notice details minimal dialogues. There long spans dialogue-free movement. And yet somehow, tempted think there's something wrong Mohan's (Sachin Nayak) righteousness. You surprised Amin (Pradip Sagar) Aseem (Pradeep Kabra) interact react. You aware Siddharth's dilemma. And Siddharth puts rest doubts Rajat Kapoor's versatility. I completely blown away way body conveyed thoughts. The rest, though outstanding, don't make doubt behavior. Throughout film, Hulla kept coming mind. Maybe pace similar Rajat Kapoor. But somehow brown hue desire show futility persistence ambitions taste feel movies. Except one worked me. And yet phases movie I could make mental trip world outside theater come back. When happens 90 minute film, leaves sense incompleteness. The way liberate let go. Let go attachments worldly needs. Our desires thus existence vain. The perceived 'purpose life' big sham. There breaking free tone failure dejection runs heavy movie. As conclusions thoughts. Then movie deals offer closings? To resolutions better hurried ones, contrived ones worse. If you're kind person sees person walking prison absolutely know in, one you. If like movies nicely tied end, skip sake. If like gift-wrapped presented hands, Siddharth - The Prisoner 'must skip' you. Me? Well, I enjoy abstractly beautiful beautifully abstract films much well-thought-out masala ones, I'd hated miss it.
