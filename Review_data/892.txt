I don't know filmmakers felt making film even watching film entirety first time. Teen Thay Bhai certainly embarrassing watch. And despite film devoid sexual humor. Just watching three great performers going one unfunny gag another extremely uncomfortable. You still remember Om Puri's brilliant performances despite really awful scripts he's picked; Shreyas Talpade doesn't need prove comic timing anymore; Deepak Dobriyal someone graduated smaller, indie films performer look forward to, however tiny role. And perfectly funny situation laid them. They 3 brothers hate forced spend time together. Unfortunately, times laugh/smile owing actors 'rising above' script lines handed. At times, want tell makers ok, get whole shirtless Salman mockery trying pull, it's funny Dobriyal it. You know 'respectful' Hindi family film going end starts hatred. And writers try show try find someone blame weaknesses, it's plain in-the-face, try subtlety give up, case audience doesn't 'get' it. Besides cannot story ups downs, one flat tone audience choose ignore doze off. And no, irrelevant sub-plot involving foreigners cops doesn't help! Interesting though, movie starts maintains good production values. Especially lighting. They used low lighting maintained grays browns despite genre film. But flashbacks uses excuse go contrast tone - loud colors, background music. They also used excuse infuse romance, song & dance, drama plot. This change ambiance disorienting. But that's immaterial it's like brown/gray/low-light 'style' make writing lame jokes better. I'm confused. What I feel worse about? High-budget films without story low-budget, indie films produced likes Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra paying attention writing.
