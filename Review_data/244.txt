A travelogue tourist vacation capturing experience recordings pictures. A personal diary - page observation life people. Angst everything that's wrong world. A mirror held society - reflect filth spot cause effect discontent discord. What Delhi-6? A bit all. And one thing entirety. It's journey non-resident Indian visiting India. You see world eyes. It's one particular pin (zip) code area. It slice town. It religious divide unity. All translates - doesn't story traditional sense term. This beauty film. Even main characters really full-blown protagonists. You know slightly know 15 side-characters. Without concrete story gradually creates appealing environment. But half-time, still "okay, NOW movie start" mode. This frustrating experience unless give edgy-choppy style story-telling. In fact, first two distinct abrupt sequences tell prepare 2-3 threads draw parallels them. And analogies aplenty. Some in-the-face sudden. The abrupt cuts background music, though brilliant, distracting let go completely. I felt like I'm snooping somebody's daily journal felt mighty uncomfortable I'm intruding privacy. Most us aware standard philosophy spouted movie. Yet, enjoy understated way told. Except end, is. It's like writers got anxious, "what audience doesn't catch subtlety?" Let us spell them: m-e-s-s-a-g-e. Very intentionally writers writing book doesn't necessarily read back-to-back. You flip open page, read, digest not, close open another random page. Like doesn't matter one thread left unresolved. Same goes songs abrupt placement. However, 'dafatan' one best picturized songs I've seen long time. Not imagination technical creativity also takes character's mindset. He turn, representative race want best worlds come together. The details within sequence, like dialogues, interactions ground-breaking fatal either. There brilliant lines amongst blah sexual innuendos. And way, case Dilli-wallas hard-core desis take offence, told often enough good heart, listen bit, ok? The undercurrent important - contradictions, double standards, bickering, human tendency reconcile need. Brothers fight like cats. But need arises part community "outsiders". Two communities fight. But something endangers unite conquer deemed-common enemy. That divides rule unite too, extent inconsistencies. And extrapolated relationship issue. Such comments things work today strewn across movie. The amused look Roshan (Abhishek Bachchan) wears introduction India extremely heartening. It neither demeaning patronizing. Abhishek isn't required anything ordinary, overpowering likes Waheeda Rahman must certainly easy task. As much credit Waheedaji especially particular scene succumbing situation. Sonam Kapoor charming screen presence makes best limited range role offers. The best bit casting Atul Kulkarni though. I one wanted see not-so-serious role. He captures Gobar's submissiveness hypocrisy. Such movies made intention evoking audience's inner voice. That's tall order. Lectures pass right 4-year old's entire system, I'd conclude conditioned ignore them. Then, even character point say, "don't sermonize us", doesn't make less speech. And that's director lost audience. Nothing moved evoke emotion, let alone invoke anything within. Equality-humanity-yadi-yada-yawwwwn. A little off-mark man given us radical climaxes - like not. The pace length could issue us. But, shouldn't miss fact courageous attempt general description life. I enjoyed nuances, hints, less blatant bits commentary society. That enough forget partially forgive need lucid three-act plot.
