I one believes old story told fresh style thus still entertain. Unfortunately converse also true. The old story told dull, soporific style bore core. You know I'm leading one - Tum Mile falls second category - boring. The one line plot simple be. Boy meets girl (as clarified title), fall love, something happens fall climax tell whether finally boy meets girl not. Now within confines freshness could meet, start liking other, misunderstanding/personality clash thrown in, etc. All things sort-of close real-life. We sure know people couples like these. But, real also translates hands-down monotonous. The situations sorry enough, dialogues attempt add flavor don't succeed much. And state affairs, much actors do? Both Emraan Hashmi Soha Ali Khan delighted, sorry, shy, frustrated, helpless script requires be. All good still mind-numbing. And two create nothing special together. No longing together. No reason feel good lovey-dovey, feel pain trying hard keep tears in. In mundane humdrum one thing sticks out. The lead lady character personality stands by. She's whimsical neither obsessive compulsive disorder. She's regular girl aspirations easy-going ways. She bend backward man snap every time back protests. And yet I don't empathize girl boy come South Africa day Bombay get stuck oh-so-rotten monsoons. It's nothing characters. It’s way entire episodes narrated. So emotionless, so…so lifeless. Why I care suffer like Rose Titanic? They couldn't create ounce I felt her. And atypical Bhatt film. Whoever director, enough twist story enough interaction within audience react, love, hate. But, I sitting, bored even finish writing review. Nope, good memorable tunes lyrics songs either! :(
