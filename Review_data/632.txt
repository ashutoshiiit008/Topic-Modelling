Brian De Palma’s 1996 blockbuster, Mission: Impossible, packed plot. It made teenagers call first 3.5” floppy disk ‘NOC List’. In new millennium, John Woo’s characteristically choreographed action set-pieces made Mission: Impossible II cult action film. Everyone wanted wheelies stoppies. In 2006, appeared though franchise run steam. A jaded superstar, nowhere-near-memorable plot action sequences done death previous installments made Mission: Impossible III experience easily forgotten. Only loyalists like would bother watch once. (Four times, last count.) The fourth installment series, Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol may fall way short great film, manages appeared impossible mission – infuses much needed life freshness M:I franchise. And Thomas C. Mapother IV aka Tom Cruise, appeared past prime, back best. The film plot isn’t complex, enough meat make interesting. Ethan Hunt organization, IMF, clear name implicated event potential escalate nuclear war. Their organization shut down, resources limited. The electric Jeremy Renner beautiful Paula Patton join Tom Cruise Simon Pegg mission avert crisis. What instantly sets film apart predecessors droll humour runs it. The first installment place humour, next two used provide hint comic relief. Ghost Protocol, however, refreshing undercurrent dry humour makes easy watch. Then, course, set pieces. Originality triumphs, even Tom Cruise bears brunt generous dose bumps falls. Yes, seem incredulous impossible part. But Tom Cruise breathes every last ounce movie-star believability them, making genuinely thrilling. Undeniably, demand dollops suspension disbelief, truly small price pay thrills. What I personally liked film first time, characters apart Ethan Hunt get hint back story. So, Jeremy Renner’s Brandt secret weighs heavily conscience, Paula Patton’s Jane wants revenge loss loved one, laptop-loving nerd Benji, played Simon Pegg, gets field agent, something never thought could be. Jeremy Renner brings magnetic intensity character. His eyes always talking, wonderful quality actor. Tom Cruise element time round, proving considered biggest movie-star world. I love face expressions make preposterous sequences seem real. I also firmly believe one underrated ‘actors’ film history. The rest cast adequate. I’m fan Hollywood, one can’t deny even make films want ‘make leave brains home’, suggest bring along, case. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol one films engage you, make enjoy it, even makes go, “Come on, that’s ludicrous!” while. Of course, Indian review film would incomplete without mentioning Anil Kapoor. He plays sleazy Indian billionaire, portrayal character quite reminiscent role Race. But make mistake, man aged better most. His role laughable, Anil Kapoor deserves kudos starring big Hollywood film way potentials Hindi cinema could. I hoping hope once, once, would turn around say, ‘Jhakaas!’ All said done, Hollywood finds easy spend big bucks cinema form zilch content. There feel M:I-4 space. However, fans genre M:I loyalists definitely feel zing film has, manages make worth watch big screen.
