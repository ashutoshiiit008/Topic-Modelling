When I entered movie hall watch Alice Wonderland, entire row behind children presumably ages 3 14. By time I turned around interval left auditorium others left behind somewhat bored. It seems book I read child made film wasn’t necessarily children. Of course book far many socio-political implications I learn much later life. But Tim Burton’s Alice Wonderland unapologetically reflects cold dystopia live in. As matter fact exaggerated fashion leaves somewhat sorts leave theatre. Burton moves away quite bit original plot Lewis Caroll’s classic tale. It follows 19-year-old Alice returns magical place (called Underland) told true destiny kill Jabberwock fierce creature end rein Red Queen. Tim Burton makes Alice sort champion whose decision fate ‘Underland’ rests. Tired told do, wear marry Alice (Mia Wasikowska) follows White Rabbit (voice Michael Sheen) rabbit hole finds company Tweedledee Tweedledum (Matt Lucas little help animation guys), Cheshire Cat (voice Stephen Fry), Dormouse (voice Barbara Windsor) March Hare (voice Paul Whitehouse) among others. Leading insane menagerie course Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), convinced (unlike others) Alice one save Underland tyranny Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) restore throne rightful White Queen (Anne Hathaway). It seems however Tim Burton’s Alice ways closer Dorothy Wizard Oz Caroll’s heroine. Burton’s Alice tumbles rabbit hole Victorian England like Dorothy flew Kansas landed wondrous Land Oz. Both ladies friends help vice versa. They also seek restore sense order world landed somewhat unknowingly somewhat changed persons return ‘home’. Burton manages create stunning alternative reality draws Alice well us it. The painstakingly created Underland might far dystopic world live in. But, perhaps insanity endearing staid ‘unhappening’ apolitical times today. In likelihood, Tim Burton get Oscar nomination Depp, steps hat Mad Hatter own. Mia plays Alice endearing job emerges unscathed despite presence talented eclectic Johnny Depp. The tight screenplay ensures edge seat first frame itself. And even though drift towards clichéd side towards end, hold attention largely implications scenes quick-witted dialogues. I could possibly go symbolism movie (the striking Red Queen White Queen obviously referring communism capitalism). But I won’t take fun away rather figure yourself. I would however tell Tim Burton’s Alice Wonderland made stop think. It brought realisation one thing us lose grow is, Mad Hatter would say, ‘muchness’. It also reminded certainly good practice believe ‘at least six impossible things breakfast’. But importantly told best way travel train car rather hat.
