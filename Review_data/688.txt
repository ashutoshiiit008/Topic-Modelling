You try summarize felt film loss. The opening sequence cool (even inspired), fart jokes well, fart jokes; scene mother daughter pretty well-written film genre, film paced well; climax one best ever, songs place even though nice...And on. That course One By Two. It chic, Hollywood rom-com feel it, except Indianized songs, etc. So, like ping-pong ball Amit's (Abhay Deol) mom (Rati Agnihotri) dad (Jayant Kriplani), move well-done thing film something shrug-worthy back; witty line/scene toilet humor; Amit's story Samara's (Preeti Desai). However, one big thing worked concept. At minute twenty, I reminded note lead pair would meet. And then, slowly, idea started getting clearer, got interesting. But - but, right? - two individual stories less boring. What worse is, comes across writers somehow knew cover added lame humor didn't belong. The curiosity left then, two stories would intersect, unfortunately point film. Samara, struggling dancer, goes regular ups downs story would struggling dancer lead character. And yet, refreshing see woman rom-com spend much on-screen time energy something man. Of course, character could written better detail layers exposed us. Even within limited scope, character's relationship mother given one nice, long scene breathe. If only, went little deeper. It doesn't help Preeti Desai doesn't whole range expressions. This makes empathy Samara stand-offish. Amit's story hand stuck, stuck, right beginning. But, maybe intentional. The thing defining lead character boring makes exactly - boring. And long stick around boring character, let alone root him. And yet, Amit right thing, give pat back. When vents, ready character graph something gets interest, remember? He stuck. Abhay Deol Amit's crazy venting bit "pakao-ed" pretty hilariously. But, didn't really doubt acting capabilities, we? What frustrating entire sequence doesn't fit film all. Amit never shown frustrated life general, suddenly outburst. The outburst makes sense, Amit it. The side characters add little spice ongoings, bearable point. And become repetitive. I would like see Preetika Chawla though. And actually, I don't mind seeing Devika Bhagat, hope next time, she'll make every thing story film crisper tighter.
