It's nice see film-maker, whose focus 'style', trying talk victimized middle class. He tries say hope helplessness taking responsibility trusting one themselves. Sounds deep dark mainstream film? Well worry not, film doesn't take seriously made ridiculous lines situations taken straight mafia films 90s. Only present day Jeevan seems Aditya Pancholi. Can get sadder that? Yes, can. The hour-long, pre-interval screen time spent set-up. It introduces 5-6 main characters lays situation - none care zero attempt character connect AND nothing compelling story far. Whatever happens work twice harder become interesting. An uphill task gets steeper. While moves, twists turns predictable, actually events took surprise - like "wow, actually Hero-oriented, Hindi film" "whoa! Didn't see twist coming! Cool!!" The thing "cool" film conceptualization scenes, terms post-production work, including editing. Rest blah comes bigger blah goes. No, lines trying hard cool dialogue don't count. That is, throwing 'facebook','twitter','google' line won't make hip popular. That "Abhishek Bachchan" attitude worn long-long ago. What's point pause sentence, predict it's going come know actor well now? Prateik Babbar doesn't look one bit like seventeen year old plays. He tries whine like one though. Rana literally looked like block moving wood would making grunting, squeaky voices every while. Bipasha Basu's role absolutely nothing important it. At level, I guess roles everyone ACP Kamath (Abhishek Bachcan) meant create pathos plight Goan middle-class population stuck corrupt administrations drug dealers. But, doesn't get there. It'd also interesting see couple things explored further, example, Kamath's misjudging people, misused woman's internal struggle. But would out-of-tone depth superficial film. I mean, talking Additional Commissioner Police breaking rap cleansing streets Goa. Where's room complexity profundity here? Story-wise whatever see film, you've already seen promos film film 80s-90s. The marvel use color light visual treatment given scenes.
