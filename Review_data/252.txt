The last time met ‘super-villain’ Gru minions, planning steal moon, Gru’s paternal instincts act speed-breaker three little orphan girls enter life. Well, can’t make up. Chris Renaud Pierre Coffin return sequel 2010 hit Despicable Me, though Despicable Me 2 quite fun well, really misses sheer audacity plot, something first film thrived on. Gru settling paternal duties nicely, organization named Anti Villain League attempt recruit sending way one agents, Lucy Wilde. They want Gru help identify nab new super-villain. And better way catch one super-villain pitting another, rationale. As animation films, Despicable Me 2 fast-paced, superbly executed yes, packed laughs. The characters – Gru, Lucy Gru’s three girls Agnes, Edith Margo – win hearts. Combined intriguing shot design usual top-notch animation, film makes sure you’re watching keenly right till end. And course, highlight, again, Gru’s minions; adorable yellow creatures penchant finding innovative ways crash, bang burn. Mostly voiced directors themselves, years they’ve become something internet phenomenon well, despite facing stiff competition characters mentioned earlier, quite simply steal film noses. Where Despicable Me 2 falters neither promises delivers good enough payoff take away – film doesn’t remain long lights come back on. The plot plain, predictable proceeds without many twists bother along way. Fun, yes, Despicable Me 2 doesn’t enough thrills truly hooked. Steve Carell reprises Gru, expectedly great zany accent. He manages make character much almost imagine Carell sitting somewhere hooked nose front microphone. Kristen Wiig Benjamin Bratt voice two primary new characters join cast – Lucy Wilde super-villain El Macho respectively, they’re fine well, though I don’t think they’ve added extra spice characters virtue voice. Miranda Cosgrove, Elsie Kate Fisher Dana Gaier return little girls Margo, Agnes Edith, simply adorable. The film’s 3D nothing boast of, I’d recommend watch film, 2D. Besides, antics minions best enjoyed without burden cumbersome glasses face. Despicable Me 2 best enjoyed loved first film, love animation films general. For others, still make breezy, fun watch. With minions’ spinoff film that’s planned 2014 - promise film yellow fellows get bulk screen time – film serves reminder that’s something worth looking forward to.
