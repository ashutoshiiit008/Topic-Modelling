There's breed among us, (numbering least thousands, ever know?) Sulemani Keeda resonate anyone else - aspiring writers Mumbai, dream words traverse journey paper celluloid (or, know, DCP files, case today). It tough life, aspiring film-maker Bombay, anywhere world. The struggle someone wants behind camera surpassed one wishes make name front it. This struggle share humour well, that's mostly writers lot don't mind looking funnier side life, even looking soaring one's head bottom pit. Amit Masurkar's film, lives screenwriter pair dream cracking one script turn fortunes around, film laced humour, insight level honesty that's hard find. Despite fact certain people bound identify film others, also film connect anyone; every story, even one writers, basis somewhere real life. In fact, film quite like popular meme visually lists situations like world sees you, parents see you, see actually are. It tiny little slice journey one is, one wants be. The journey may fraught disappointment failure, we're still it. Our 'heroes', (though they're anything but,) named Mainak Dulal. Yes, they're writing film big Khan. The hitch they're yet meet him. It little touches like lend sense comic irony film. Mainak street smart likely write kind lines one hears Dabangg. Dulal, hand, idealist, poet, nomad heart. When falls love, goes whole hog. And heart breaks - well, I'd leave figure happens writer's heart breaks. What heart-warming Sulemani Keeda fact without emphatic jingoistic it, subtly subverts many clich√©s we've come expect romantic comedy. The process meeting, attraction, realizing presence emotional intellectual connect - seems much genuine. (A big reason cast, I'll get bit.) Even done-to-death airport climax dumped favour sequence that's likely it'll be, happen real life. Kudos, also, film-makers character Ruma, kind woman you're likely run middle class Bombay woman you've seen screen. Mayank Tewari Naveen Kasturia, play Mainak Dulal respectively, perform like there's camera, though Mainak Dulal. Cinematic characters usually spend relative time worrying morality real people. Director Masurkar gets bang on, way treats characters moral dilemmas. Mainak comes across likeable creep, Dulal bumbling romantic. They're real people, two, even they're probably amalgam bunch them. Aditi Vasudeo, plays Ruma, absolute natural. Admittedly, film doesn't age well one would hoped. I first watched film year ago Mumbai Film Festival, seemed much less like low budget indie back then. In fact, apparent much 'jugaad' - getting things done hook crook - gone film. Yet, that's also beauty it. In it's message well manner made, film inspires undertake journey seek. For story.
