From earth Punjab come people charmingly simple open-hearted uninhibited. We know unrepressed dialogue given Punjabis. Punjabis change don't shout dressed loud silks. Yet, cannot escape lack depth basic plot. I guess can't get all. You know protagonist Omi (Kunal Kapoor) going end looking secret ingredient grandfather's recipe. After seeing trailers, main reasons bring theater - find happens happens see 10% deviation prediction going be. You can't resist hope least something different name Anurag Kashyap associated it, right? Unfortunately, wait wait happen, doesn't come. That small twist extra conflict exposed trailer 'ah-ha' moment film nicely lovingly building towards - doesn't come. It teases every protagonist, Omi (Kunal Kapoor) considering behave according character made be, ultimately, teased. And many, many films, end little contrived convenient. Fortunately though, warm performances every member cast, dialogue given, Amit Trivedi's music rugged, dusty ambiance created four strong pillars Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana stands on. The chemistry various combinations characters charming brewing romance flavor cute. From twinkle grandpa's eyes first sees Omi 10 years tune title music breaks halfway dust walls houses lot things - everything works adding value experience watching story. However, predictable basic plot predictable basic plot provide much firm foundation however strong pillars. This once, belief get end story done well, find doesn't matter much proven slightly wrong. For whatever Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana achieved "how"s going right. If only, little "how" also meat story part writing. Also, ever since missing ingredient revealed, I nagging feeling seen read somewhere. An internet search hasn't brought much light except concept missing ingredient/recipe looked umpteen number times, always knew. But sense 'tune haunts can't think words' won't leave me. Hopefully, it'll come soon.
