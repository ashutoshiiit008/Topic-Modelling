I recently visited Sikkim, tiny, north-eastern state India borders three countries. Needless say encountered lot military camps, one 17100 feet sea level. One question always haunts - makes person decide wants stay away family, face death every day? What kind passion drives him? Heroes makes attempt answer question. Unfortunately, started interestingly debate camouflage leading us pre-determined conclusion. The stories three soldiers encompass intimate relationships - spouse, siblings, parents. And well, clearly defining prominent member family. But, can't said two bikers set meet families, Sammy Ali. There slight differences things move trigger behavior fuzzy. Anyway, story much draw three families. Alas, one story manages touch you. The others crippled over-dramatization predictability. The elegance beautifully seeping interiors Punjab real treat - especially since it's contrast loud Punjabis usually depicted Hindi movies. Certainly, Preity Zinta's composed performance lot story moves you. Soon enough, Sunny Deol takes loudness apparently missing. And narrative downhill. Sunny Deol comes across eccentric, again, character supposed eccentric. Having given benefit doubt too, bit much handle. This followed Mithun Chakraorty's story lot potential since affected character debating people joining army. But, didn't required vigor enthusiasm take movie touchdown. The culprit length movie. The forever, dragged hugs don't place movie like this. And become bore subtlety gives way long-winded spiels shove patriotism throat. The slapsticky introduction bikers too, absolutely tune rest movie. Not mention songs. Do really see one Deol brother teach dance?! It requires courage avoid sleaze so-called glamour. Yet, Heroes manage raise question answers it, even convincingly. It gives us opportunity salute. Salutes heroes lay lives us. Salutes families make sacrifices like duty. Salutes bravery pride.
