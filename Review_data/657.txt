Once flimsy duty-free spree I happened catch whiff Chanel no. 5, also Marilyn Monroe’s famously endorsed fragrance – I knew second chosen brand ambassador. It naughty scent; teasingly stimulating musk, one lingered couple hours, strong yet subtle blotches sweet jasmine-y smell. I could picture Monroe standing atop platform, dress flying saying, “that’s I smell, lovelies”. As I watched My Week Marilyn, I remember moments duty free section. Michelle Williams film, based book Colin Clark absolute stunner. While film might tad bit weak, story wise, feeling bit repetitive clumsy, Williams like bottle Chanel no. 5. She’s real deal; nearly close (that’s also ONE Monroe), every moment appears screen, share conviction, acts lovely, sassy rendition Marilyn Monroe. The film set 1956, told us Clark’s point view. Clark (played Eddie Redmayne) aspiring filmmaker, finally gets break third assistance director England shoot The Prince Showgirl. He meets Marilyn Monroe – much like first time, Williams introduction Monroe film, blows minds too. She’s charm. And course, she’s difficult actress – always late, messing lines, questioning director’s call quirks. She develops soft corner Clark, meekness awe her. Through (warped) relationship –Clark’s Monroe’s – see much discussed traits character. Her loneliness, insecurities brashness shown us Clark’s point view. It’s diva behavior audiences alien to, we’ve read quite bit Monroe. It’s idea Clark confidant gets see side isn’t restricted sultry public persona big win. We see dreamy, questioning Monroe confidently she’s best The Prince The showgirl. But also see disturbed side hers, speculates gets dangerously close Clark film. There drawbacks My Week Marilyn, though. First one script: it’s repetitive doesn’t bring forward anything new. The film extremely performance heavy; without Williams’ colorfully sensual performance Monroe film would quite flat. The film standout dialogues though. But much accolades Williams bringing camera-loving side Monroe. It’s hard task, Monroe notoriously sex-kitten face, every single human I know stopped look twice point lives. It’s naughty, period. While Williams' face lot simplistic pleasing, tend let mind wander every then. You’ll notice review Marilyn versus Williams her, opposed review film. That exactly move with, film over. You might even like film much, it’s story that’s adding anything new life one stays you. Clark (Eddie Redmayne) infatuated boy natural, perfect catalyst bring nostalgia Marilyn Monroe. But all, My Week Marilyn belongs Michelle Williams; sheer gut able make audiences accept “different” portrayal making us want curse born 50s.
