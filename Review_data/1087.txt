Zila Ghaziabad revenge drama never should've made. Just like Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story romance never should've made. Without ounce originality Zila Ghaziabad seems like someone's fetish watching two hours worth action. Amidst free-for-all shootout, hilarious see bone picked goons wore fake police uniforms shooting. Huh? That objection keepers law order had? Other that, maybe four atmost five one-liners might bring smiles, two would innuendos. Almost every frame reeks drama. And drama almost always means either loud background score slow motion goes little would needed make drama effective. But hey, say, world slo-mo defines character focus - If he's recorded slo-mo means important, means along characters film, fear him. That deep writing goes. The three male leads could take others' place character wouldn't know. The women, calling props would mean significance film. Unless role one shot/kidnapped get another man, implies meaning life men film. With background then, men need emote all. And even try would come across anything fake. Even so, see Paresh Rawal, Arshad Warsi Ravi Kisen least try. Sanjay Dutt Vivek Oberoi hand try hard. The interesting character seems Fakeera (Sunil Grover) plays Shakuni Mama supposed replay Mahabharat. Just case miss Mahabharat analogy loud 'yada yada hi dharmasya' playing Pritam Singh (Sajay Dutt) action. It's different matter two sides waging war cunning character could mean trying depict Mahabharat. So, give one break Sanjay Dutt staring chess board much contemplation moving pawn board first move! It doesn't end here, later two kings facing other, two steps away other. Item numbers - two one, cheesy one-liners, self-referencing jokes that's makes parts Zila Ghaziabad aren't action. The action sequences tedious almost competition tiring drama.
