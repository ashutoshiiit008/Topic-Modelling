"Life game chess" - That statement neither new profound. Yet, Bhindi Bazaar Inc's makers impressed analogy made movie it. And took every move literally. It's parallel chess game story film fun start gets tiring soon. The entire movie feels like one long exposition, characters still introduced. It could over-dramatization slo-mo sequences, seems like still seeing new stuff - new people, new situations within film. When, fact, aren't. Also, way film unfolds, like, "ok, introduced characters, let real story begin." This largely "real" story flashback. In fact, present teasing you. Constantly. It also feels like teaser Kay Kay Menon sitting there, call role elongated special appearance. Similarly, nothing challenging Piyush Mishra Prashant Narayanan either. The sore thumb sticking new kid block Gautham . He doesn't match talent surrounded by. Deepti Naval represents condition suppressed woman underworld calm composure. Just like Shilpa Shukla expresses growing role women crime aggression. Vedita Singh gets play slutty b!tch, makes opportunity. The conclusion cast capable; offered run-of-the-mill material work with.

It's didn't give plot thorough think patched stuff together came in. The attempts dot 'I's clean clear. But done - overall story sure. And details filled filthy language crass dialogue - appropriate given setting, also doesn't shock more. I can't help feel tad disappointed. It's like I walked great expectations. It's I thought I'd coming mind-blowing performances I'd remember long time come.
