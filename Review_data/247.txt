I could watch Deool play light shade frame. And even amazing considering film set village many time there's electrical power source light oil lamp sometimes stars moon. Even I didn't realize beautiful shot, I could watch village simpletons. Their faces bodies expressive, true actors one them, camera front them, I observing people village grandparents live. And yet, Deool so, much offer. So little less metaphorical director, Umesh Kulkarni's earlier venture couple avoidable "commercial" elements? I enjoyed ride Deool took on. Deool transformation Mangrul, village remotest interiors Maharashtra. It satirical journey Mangrul's belief religion blind faith accompanies it. And Mangrul representation common population, us. Deool argues definition development village behind basic necessities like water electricity missing action. Is bad village gets simple needs using blind faith stepping stone? Though I'm sure Deool stays non-judgmental sure good job presenting sides. Deool talks capitalism business religion; showcases strength women time hypocrisy political system one breath. And narrated fluidly. The sedentary village laid-back residents go one event another realize know characters quirks, intentions motivations. This much result immaculate dialogue-writing way/dialect it's delivered. And even though I watched non-subtitled version. I surely must've missed punch lines. The actors take entertainment next level. Even exaggerated tones seem acceptable make laugh hard. There least couple scenes mouth wide open ridiculous way things unfolding - I knew could happen village too. There scenes created beautiful and/or insightful moments. I especially enjoyed exchanges Nana Patekar Dilip Prabhavalkar. Mentioning two names huge disservice rest cast, list long every villager comes screen leaves impression. Let also quickly add couple scenes Nana Patekar overdid it. But, hardly took away film. That doesn't mean eliminable elements 2.5 hours, Deool little long. Also tad disappointing introduction "commercial" elements Umesh Kulkarni film. Is Umesh succumbing? Because item number cameo "bigger" Hindi actor. Those can, once, grant benefit doubt to, cloak "the need script". But, also seems gone extra mile explain metaphors left usual subtle style. But hey, I don't mind little commerce art. Deool many ways Valu - Part 2. It carries tone texture AND leaves tiny "not good as" first part feel. Yet, wholesome entertaining experience.
