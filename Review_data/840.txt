The one thought subconsciously remains eight short films Shuruaat Ka Interval, manifests biggest takeaway experience whole, fact none films made burden commercial expectations. Each filmmakers made film wanted make. Some feel little raw, yes, seemed exist minds director engaging experience audience doesn’t know filmmaker’s mind. Yet, eight films perhaps honest pieces filmmaking expect Indian filmmakers year. Themed around word ‘interval’, filmmaker interpreted way, come starkly different interpretations theme. My personal favourite anthology Final Interval, directed Aarti Bagdi, person pillar family. Despite film’s rather weak performances, interesting multi-threaded narrative came together gut-wrenching finish. Another beautiful, somber experience The Gatekeeper, directed Atanu Mukherjee. Largely single character film person mans railway crossing, film beautifully shot, moves sheer melancholy protagonist’s life, also makes wonder would take live years years kind life gatekeeper lives. Yet another haunting single character piece Shishir Jha’s August, basically question constitutes right wrong. Treated black-and-white, film staid decently performed, often seemed like deserved little exposition, though choice one can’t fault with. A close second favourite Ayan, directed Amrit Raj Gupta. Perhaps best acted film amongst lot, film takes us backstage theatrical performance Ramayan, man playing Ram disappears, leaving remaining actors director lurch. Hilarious spontaneous, rat-a-tat dialogue delivery really fine acting, Ayan genuine fun. Also, one two films anthology slotted true comedies, one likely memorable film lot. The comedy, Interval 3D Palash Vaswani, interesting premise. In middle show B-grade horror film, character film gets thrown film enters real world, meets audience. This highly intriguing premise, though, let weak attempts comedy. Also, film colour-graded far much – possibly give unreal feel plot demands; seems far inorganic, want better word. Krishan Hooda’s The Last Audition dark comedy anything else, masks tragedy life struggling actor Bombay is. People heard ‘struggling actors’, visit Bombay silently observe thousands auditions take place given day here, realize perhaps heart-breaking life person lead. Beautifully acted protagonist, The Last Audition rooted film lot. The film set I found tad indulgent terms narrative Ankit Tripathi’s No Exit. The film interesting idea core – memories bane one’s existence – follows jagged structure doesn’t work kind film aspires be. It one film lot absolutely nothing me. Perhaps daring, layered assured film anthology Rukshana Tabassum’s Bubbles Stars. Confusing beautiful equal measure, – use word film – ‘randomness’. In interval play, characters (not actors,) live little life own. Steady black-and-white images gel well interaction two zany characters, film strangely reminded highly sanitized, 50s version Q’s Tasher Desh – though probably highly personal feeling. The film probably need multiple viewings thoroughly absorb, quite simply intriguing film lot. Shuruaat Ka Interval inspiration aspiring filmmakers, refreshing change audience hasn’t served genuinely honest cinema seems like decades. Hopefully, film usher trend theatrical releases shorts, mean good things Indian cinema. Note: The ratings given entire experience eight short films anthology, obviously accurately convey rating individual film.
