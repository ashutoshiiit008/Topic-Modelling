So comes another movie based superpowers, mysterious aliens, leaves scope sequels. The title narration sound great, even though trailer doesn’t look promising. John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) others hunted Mogadorians, fourth list. The action really good. It fast, opens film brilliantly, special effects I loved. Add sound effects it’ll keep edge seat. But action scenes last small duration. And plot typical it’s depressing. The worn terrain good evil moulded teenage story. The movie doesn’t even focus alien-vs-alien-on-earth concept. The direction little disappointing too. I mean, people don’t go high school photography labs make bad guys right behind! Clichés used fullest - ‘blending in’ immediately translates wearing hood jacket. And John’s guardian, Henri, 4-6 computer screens delete pictures John internet. There course lot unbelievable stuff mainly executed unconvincingly. Like say, stone glows bright blue blazing sun? Dialogues little punch little taste. They concentrated necessary love story instead plot development. No flashbacks, villains histories, heroic escapes shown even talked of. Plus explanations things happen way are. And whatever little explanation given far satisfying. For example, 9 hunted down, bad guys bad? Let’s hope come explanations sequel. The love story boring teenage tragedy. One could easily fall asleep part. I admit though, performances surprisingly good. Okay, least better Twilight Saga. Timothy Olyphant plays John’s guardian, Henri worth mention. Even protective, concern passion eyes – something I believe hard do. Others decent amateurs. And like friend said – movie would definitely sold better named ‘I Am Number Six’. Teresa Palmer plays hot, confident Number 6 also hunted down, watches John’s back. Hot chick, hot action, hot bike. What else want? So want get best movie, watch action, sleep high school drama.
