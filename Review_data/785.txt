Road, Movie another one films take sink in. One audience comes laughing haven't clue transpired there. Yep, I didn't understand film, purpose, characters. But, aroused enough curiosity. And make think. Not necessarily issues raised film, film trying say. Yeah, kind film. In fact, absolutely spell-binding cinematography, I'd suggested wait till it's TV/DVD. One needs develop palate films, I'm still one appreciate narration completely. So absurd, bizarre talk about. The best way tell is. And there's hardly worry giving movie away, open interpretation. The stage set truck carrying reels reels films mechanism play arid, rugged, barely inhabited desert. Water precious oil. Oil abundant water. And despite basic need people aspirations dreams. And well dreams come true, dreams. Or something like that. :D And dreams picturized beautifully. Of course, abstract way. It's difficult explain it's difficult digest too. Not mention it's easily graspable first place. Ok, I don't mean scare you. It's going knowing film hope accomplishment dark enigmatic tone, might help. Given ambiguity, I needed care someone, least one four characters. Ok, I wanted find water quench thirst, I want women walking miles together desert sun find water. I couldn't care more. The characters pretty flat, except Vishnu (Abhay Deol). But Vishnu isn't person would care for. You could hate him, wanted spend kind energy. I'd say Abhay Deol followers ones keen watch film. Not per se, choice films. And one less likely disappoint part audience. He doesn’t way much do. And part needs play, always, uses eyes expressions body language. Satish Kaushik fairly entertaining job, that's character sort-of sweet adorable types. Mohammad Faisal Usmani, 10-odd year old, much smart-Alec kind-of character get interested he's played it. The lines given rather annoying. Tannishtha Chatterjee, lovely screen presence. I completely fell love song character sings loneliness night. Then odd things stick out. Nicely greased faces lips dry due heat. The background music beautifl, didn't feel like went tone film, thus stuck out. That adds obscure atmosphere. Then people interiors knowledge presence mind use brands like "starbucks" daily language. And it's intelligent film, line wasn't put thoughtlessly. Does mean entire film dream characters? phew Road, Movie. An intentionally ambiguous film. A film purposefully left open interpretation. A deliberate attempt making audience yell, "what the…?!" The lyrics age-old song take new meaning playing credits roll - Sar jo tera chakraaye Ya dil dooba jaaye Aaja pyaare paas hamaare Kaahe ghabraaye, kaahe ghabraaye … Sun sun sun, beta sun champi mein bade bade gun Laakh dukhon ki ek dava hai kyon na aazmaaye, kyon na aazmaaye (If head muddled Or heart sinking low Come darling Worry not, worry … Listen dear, hear This greasy wonder virtuous A hundred thousand pains one solution Why don't try, don't try?) Seems like makers saying, don't understand, don't worry. Just watch films, enjoy are, one solution problems, no? ducking brick
