Why lie partner? To avoid confrontation, protect getting hurt, protect hurting, maybe something get rid boredom wouldn't approve of. You could blame them, could blame yourself, point end lying, expected honest. This true both, men women. Shaadi Ke Side Effects expresses skewed view aspect married life, far stretched-out repetitive fashion. I understand women like Trisha Roy (Vidya Balan) - obsessed child, want nothing career, friends, husband. And yes, shocking sounds men like (tackily named) Siddharth Roy (Farhan Akhtar) think child third person. But, I guess obsession partner begets apathy towards obsession partner - obsession could sports one couple, socialization another, food third on. But, none made interesting copy Shaadi Ke Side Effects. The stereotyping women infuriating. But hey, many Hindi films not. In cases like these, I convince makers generalizing, narrating story one man one woman relationship. And then, see sister similar. And smile, cool say, "okay, runs genes." But, Shaadi Ke Side Effects doesn't stop that. There sweeping statements parents little children. Even satire garb, exaggeration gag-worthy. And despite this, I saw taking sides - record, man's case woman's. At one point, things went exact opposite Siddharth wanted, many audience, including me, blurted "oh no!". Towards end, I almost furled abuse Trisha loud. This commendable, considering fact I know characters exist, I didn't identify all. 100% credit Vidya Balan Farhan Akhtar that. Ram Kapoor Vir Das add bit normal quirk mix, lead couple. But them, Shaadi Ke Side Effects one films attempt find solution serious problem, don't want lose audience taking subject seriously. Given overall angst towards film take, I appreciate try say something universally acceptable - own. The problem though try inject humor using exaggerated dose hyperbole - end flat face. Worse yet, seen almost quippy one-liners trailers. Other couple witticisms first 15-20 minutes, hardly new material makes laugh later film. This one film shouldn't longer 100 minutes. Each 50 minutes 100-minute mark boring Roys' marriage. That one-third film. Not done all. The music decent, adds minutes elongates experience, becomes annoying. Relationships bud, blossom, peak, plateau, struggle make changes wait see bud die. Except Shaadi Ke Side Effects struggle. It cute couple grappling relationship wants find way rather cop out. You might want sort out. But problem don't necessarily want witness it.
