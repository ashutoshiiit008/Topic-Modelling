I suspect director deprived past. He shown movies lacked slo-mo stylization "star". Also felt disadvantaged writers didn't spell particular thing "happened" film. So much saw first time, decided, "I swear everyone dear me, I'll make sure viewers don't feel left-out. I'll explain detail flashbacks happened two minutes ago. It'll also much unnecessary style child suffer like me." Only hopefully, child grown enough keep kids away Ek. But, enjoy absurdity films come often not, dose nirvana. I kid not; Bobby Deol doesn’t single regular speed shot normally delivered dialogue till minute 40. Complete loud, pompous background music, weird camera movements all. The style goes minute come right back. Maybe that's title refers to. O-kay, I'm exaggerating one tiny bit. And case wondering, weren't partial Bobby Deol, bit going main characters. As promised though Nana Patekar come different, "cool" avatar. His casual manner saying lines adds required touch humor. It require finesse deliver crass lines charm. While I'm giving credit it's due, couple smart lines Nandu (Bobby Deol) talks Joshi (Raghuveer Yadav). All nullified taken one tiring monologue monologue, especially towards end. None characters fleshed out. They part regular Punjabi family. No creativity all. The loud women, one quiet lady, giggling girls, over-smart kids, annoying lead actress, cunning good-for-nothings. And yes completely avoidable Chunkey Pandey! Yet, writing 100% loss. The transition Bobby Deol's character pretty smooth. And yet, it’s far cry believable. It comes across start good thought didn't go way completion. Just like neither full-fledged comedy, romantic film, action, thriller. A bit incomplete them. It serves strong reminder films masala utmost importance. This too, again, full strength thus doesn't leave good aftertaste.
