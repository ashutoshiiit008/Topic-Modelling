Superhero vs. End-of-the-worlder - many ways theme go. Krrish 3 goes exactly way - predictable last scene detail. Even so, well-written superhero films something hero's dilemma situations go through, keep interested. Krrish 3 shows potential situations couple times, fizzle away. Krrish 3 fizzles away. Actually, film somewhat surprise expect. I didn't expect much story - expectations set Krrish. But, even though aren't remotely logical, things cute. Just thought put wasn't expected - reaches you. For example, manner end-of-the-worlder, Kaal (Viveik Oberoi) gets army together. Also, laughable Rohit's (Hrithik Roshan) pet project is, concept used adorably. On hand, I expected VFX keep glued turn shoddy way many parts. The special effects first 20 minutes shocked me. The inside aircraft's cockpit reminded drives car shot 50s! When Krrish (Hrithik Roshan) flies, it's fastening cord holds Hrithik Roshan edited out, else pretty much tell it's there. However, special effects work too. Despite thousand one inspirations Krrish 3's VFX rather disappointing. There much blame low budget. At least, shouldn't attempted effects action sequences couldn't well. Mediocrity area action film stature acceptable. One main things action film relies heavily dialogue. And Krrish 3 absolutely nothing going department. "Fusion Future," really? It's almost written reviewers fill paragraph with. Then, Krrish sending across public service announcements blatantly advertising way many brands. Neither - noble money-minded - place film. They instantly, bring back real world, jerky considering fantasy world Krrish lives in. For minutes, I impressed, even fair share amusement, Krishna vs. Kaal metaphor going film. And course, spoon-feed make wonder villain named Kaal that, supposedly cool line could said Kaal. Oh well. That besides child gets absolutely unacceptable line. Interestingly enough, I didn't mind performances all. It could mental preparation onslaught hamming. But 2.5 hours passed cringes, least owing acting. Hrithik Roshan's transition Rohit (dad) Krishna (son) Krrish (superhero) makes admire him. It must easy modulate voice keep consistent way Rohit. Now, didn't flare nostrils sign anger and/or disappointment and/or fear. Priyanka Chopra little do, one glimpse stays half fraction second, makes wish given zone. Viveik Oberoi decent job instilling fear mean villain - two minutes. After lament character could been. I guess cannot fault actor that. But gives precious little do. Kangna Ranaut's character, Kaaya suffers shortcoming writing department. Else, could've really interesting character Kangna fair job too. But then, makers spent time characters, wouldn't time find abrupt places songs inserted now, would they? That besides, music, lyrics worst choreography (except steps Hrithik Roshan) take straight back 90s. Now, need that? So, given I liked film, would I watch again? Not chance! Do I regret watching once? I don't regret watching film (well, almost - exceptions here). Would I mind kids watched it? Not really, once, though. If Hrithik Roshan fan - Happy Diwali! For rest us, don't watch Happy Diwali way! :D
