Anybody write story. But translating written word cinema takes whole lot more; no, money resources film invariably requires, craft create sense atmosphere; ability evoke emotional reaction; sheer fortitude go whole hog stick characters journey that, then, existed paper. For much more, director Denis Villeneuve deserves pat back. An innocuous-enough Thanksgiving dinner two families turns nightmare younger child family, girls, go missing. The nightmare becomes horrifying passing minute, sequence unfolding events stems past repercussions future… Prisoners, quite easily counts one favourite films year far, begins gently uttered prayer. Then, stark, measured, bone-chilling thriller begins unfold, careful cinema-watcher may notice Christian iconography subtly repeatedly appears initial half film, suddenly stops. Consequently, one can’t help wonder significance alarming larger scheme things. That is, course, writer director choose clear fog let release heartbeat you’d holding long. You’ll probably forget symbolism foreshadowing, Villeneuve truly, genuinely, comes trumps Prisoners. His narration extremely understated, subtle be. He lays almost cards table earlier directors would guts to. The trick, though, lies achieving balance revealing cards, inviting, fact challenging, even attentive viewers keep pace him. Unlike lot thrillers you’re always either step ahead director many steps behind, Prisoners, you’re almost always walking alongside him. How much enjoy film depends he’s showing you, you’re looking. Then, course, moral ambiguity writer director toy with. There’s father one missing girls, there’s cop investigating case, world affected terrifying ordeal. You always know want film end, moral questions film poses journey end really holds film together. Prisoners embellished least two standout performances. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, father one missing girls. In span two years, Jackman played widely different characters Real Steel, Les Misérables, The Wolverine Prisoners, one can’t help wowed time appears screen. His desperation, conviction frustration seem real, can’t help feel him. The revelation, though Jake Gyllenhaal interestingly named Loki, obsessive detective chasing case. Gyllenhaal played similar character David Fincher’s Zodiac, performance Prisoners shows much grown actor. The soul film, however, Roger Deakins’ cinematography. Be dark, torch-lit headlight-lit frames sleet-obscured shots, film’s continuous sense murky foreboding must almost wholly credited Mr. Deakins. Every time I watch film shot him, I can’t help feel truly one greatest cinematographers ever. Prisoners also sparse background score enhances mood film creates. As characters film question act motivations, question moral compass well. Prisoners isn’t quite film everyone, isn’t bloodshed horrifying aspects story. The fact let get sucked world film creates, ask questions well. And those, usually, toughest ones answer.
