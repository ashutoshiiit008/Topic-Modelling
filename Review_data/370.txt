Honestly, I'd happy one-line review saying - "Go watch movie! Period." But would lazy woman work. It's always difficult point finger liked movie. It also sort-of takes away experience intellectualizing breaking something enjoyed whole. But gotta gotta do, goes. When opening credits begin minutes movie, I shocked realize - 3-4 minutes cross mind I actually listening character give political, inspirational speech. The visuals engaging Kay Kay Menon's expressions intense completely occupied senses. For person gets bored easily monologues even remotely sound like lectures, one big score positive side. The effort spent casting showed every pick performed well too. To name one would injustice list really long. The women might seem bit eccentricities might intentional regular 'miss goody two shoes' women-next-door. And positives grew number that. Sure there's politics, there's undercurrent romance. But there's lot happening underneath. There's dissatisfaction everywhere. The entire chain power fieldworker henchmen puppet-leader chief strategist wants exude confidence, power smart-Alecness till next person higher comes in. Each one wants claim superiority find someone pull down. Now, true state politics home office politics. There many subtle things second third viewing uncover somehow sense existence. And course, I call director's eccentricities like blue-and-red man flautist. Then there's strong sexual gender-bias flittering around ecosystem. Though Anurag's women seem fierce sensuousness them, don't seem unreal neither seem out-of-place, forced, contrived thing. This I need mention I liberally label unnecessary expression sexuality 'gratuitous'. I always get apprehensive I begin looking forward movie. The last thing anyone spoil experience expectations. But, one thing safely look forward Anurag Kashyap film awesome novel music, even better lyrics perfect use compositions. Too many words describe something one needs get completely absorbed soaked in. Let stop writing here, stop reading go watch movie.
