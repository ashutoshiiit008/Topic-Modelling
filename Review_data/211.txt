“This one another Duniyadari. I telling you,” smirked man sitting next friend. As screening Classmates began, I couldn’t stop linking films instances. I on’t know guy astrologer well-versed films similar genre (I smell latter). Such prediction may hardly surprise you; given kind films industry famous making. Well, broad sense, Classmates way Duniyadari spin-off; comparisons highly inevitable. Classmates official remake 2006 Malayalam film name. The original said trendsetter Kerala film industry. If success replicated Tamil Telugu well, Marathi? Remakes films south rage Bollywood Marathi industry also seems following suit. Not I’m anti remakes; eventually matters entertainment. But cost logic. The latest remake filled possible, formulaic elements considered principle foundations college-life films. This leaves neither surprised wanting more. A group college students stay class in, spends large amount time cracking jokes, dropping one-liners, riding bikes, dancing tunes lip-synching songs scuffling around. Enter romance, undying friendships and, prominently, college elections. This dramatic time actually unfolds old memories students (now ex) gathered reunion. Having seen multitude films set 90s (or even prior that); I don’t want pick apart ingredients, matter superficial seem me. As narrative jumps past present, visible difference makeup costumes. The visual treatment past story fancy barely reminisces 90s era. The production sorely misses point here. The film largely deals political disputes interlaced suspense plentiful action. Some moments blatant, (the one right interval one leads climax) simply masterstroke. You know story headed to. Yet; Classmates gets increasingly intriguing post interval, one reason correctly placed conflicts. On contrary, sequence – interrelates past present – casting doubts intentions - way written even executed makes film appear murder thriller. Nothing wrong long gels well storytelling. But whole aim make feel-good film, forcibly inject things create suspense? This one totally needless lame effort. Unnecessarily stretched runtime big disappointment too. A cleverly edited first half could surely saved yawns. I must say, Ankush Chaudhari master performer. He essays role college heartthrob seamlessly gets character lost man. Though character another repetition Duniyadari, impresses throughout. Classmates, riddled several narrative flaws, actually made worth watching talented cast (look Pallavi Patil Siddharth Chandekar). As I write piece, one thing refuses leave mind film’s background score. It reminds personal favorite, The Dark Knight-themed score. In Classmates, Ankush’s character addresses not-so-good things ‘small aahe (it’s small)’ quality ‘darja’. His delivery makes words sound really intense. Ironically, efforts fed away end picture turns dull could get. Small aahe!
