Break Ke Baad title inviting. For reviewers poke fun at. But shall refrain. Make try refrain. Neither interval high point film. The conflict comes promos stays zzzzz climax. Like Abhay (Imran Khan) Aaliya's (Deepika Padukone) relationship, moments come go. But nothing lingers, except looming sense boredom. With focus two characters, you'd hope, film would take us level know exactly going behave. The problem though know writers much better. We know, like Abhay, never take risks. Actually, half-way film, know there's disappointment written end. If everyone lives happily ever after, going yawn. If choose otherwise, going ridiculing pointlessness film. The writers brought no-win situation upon themselves. Way many times beautiful thought ruthlessly murdered making verbose. A film aims relating youngsters something interesting fights, no? You understand pain don't get big deal is! A girl boy love other. And like girls boys love, bicker get nerves. One clingy, wants space. They used other, ricochet staying together apart. Every say something remarkably insightful other. Like two people actually know other. Our life screen. In fact, add zest, don’t take fights seriously. Good. Only happens first half hour repeats 3-4 times till end. Yet, don't sense claustrophobia going through. And ultimately, characters behave like characters film like normal human beings. From cool differences conflict, suddenly kids go break back not. Bad. Very bad. When film chooses mimic life relationships, expect certain warmth, completely missing. It's actors good job. Deepika Padukone's straight back always made not-so-human me. But, director chooses lot close-up shots uses well too. The irritation, confusion, straightforwardness comes through. Imran Khan wears lot make-up. He looks like school boy. His character little feminine side. That's cool passes guy who's love struck too. But it's ordinary. They still don't make characters believable. Also, I'd much rather see Sharmila Tagore Navin Nischol, see shoddily written characters silliest lines. There couple side characters interesting, writers didn’t time converting dialogues long, mundane monologues, delve them. I appreciate subtlety Nadia's (Shahana Goswami) relationship Abhay Aaliya looked like editing took whole lot film. Equally wasted awesome music. The songs come go background without registering much visually. Only saving grace picturisation don't kill songs either, even don't add them. I'm still going buy album. Actually, title Break Ke Baad sham. Because one ventured person goes he/she broken up. Whether broken person has, it's still hurtful pain comes across twice film. And, even then, doesn't cut you. Baah! What romanticized world I live in. I'm expecting romantic films touch me.
