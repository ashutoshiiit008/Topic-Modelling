Ankush Choudhary clearly man love himself. In addition lead actor Zhakaas, also directed film. So gets walk multiple times slow motion towards camera (Ray Bans tow), leap super human heights stay long enough wink audience, general make feel slightly important actually is. Last seen disastrous Pratibimb, aura someone really cannot take seriously. Perhaps helped Zhakaas measure, inane is, I still came away feeling mildly amused. The prime reason fact film really doesn’t take seriously. It promises entertainment reaction co-audience theatre anything go by, manages deliver measure. The plot ludicrous be. Right initial reels, revealed Ankush’s character leads triple life, three different girls. A series gags go explain Five Ws One H situation. Needless say, logic anything might appear close thesaurus take backseat flick. The performances film add measure school-boyish charm ridiculous goings-on. Ankush surprisingly endearing, invests completely part, I say, parts. Of three girls, Sai Tamhankar spunky photographer Neha succeeds sprinkling believability part. She manages emote well most, occasional tendency go top. But then, film, doesn’t? Pooja Sawant innocent head ad agency pleasant. Amruta Khanvilkar looks marvelous Kolhapuri bombshell, completely miscast vis-à-vis performance. The guys come across true winners though, Jeetendra Joshi, Pushkar Shrotri Vikas Samudre three lovers denied lady loves cool stud (?)Ankush. Each characters unique quirks seem pointless, add flavour comedy. They involved series madcap jokes set-pieces delivered convincingly them, willing forgive downright stupidity. Technically, film nothing boast of. Colourful feel, still leaves lot desired terms production value. Also, though might problem projection theatre I watched this, seemed framing times simply careless, characters’ heads getting cut apparent reason. The music film purely functional. The fact couple songs Hindi lyrics, however, truly disappointing. It hard see point making Marathi film Hindi songs. Ultimately, manages ensure film isn’t complete waste fact that, quite like Priyadarshan’s Malayalam films yore, number jokes wouldn’t funny language. For reason alone, I afforded smile film done.
