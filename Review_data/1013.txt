'Failure', 'Red mark family', 'Good nothing' (naalaayak), 'Disgraceful' - Many us must grown (or growing up) words used, often, instead name. Of course, didnâ€™t enjoy relish memory now. Yet wanted be, neigh, needed good graces, irrespective definition 'grace' honor. Udaan life screen. Even one many boasted 'best child universe' badge, knew someone living hell. You get point? Watch either way. :) Update: Theaters weekend shouting booked more. While Udaan touches heart, Tere Bin Laden serious laughter magnet. Lamhaa loses novelty value even august company. It's like haven't seen story earlier. Amitabh Bachchan Kabhie-Kabhie played Amit Malhotra gave aspirations poet filled father's shoes family business. Vicky rebelled dad Sharaabi similar reasons. But films, aspect backstory, small part whole scheme. Udaan's beauty that, facet humanity lack thereof IS story. And story's hero, iconized Rajat Barmecha. He's suffering creative soul, Rohan Singh. The young debutant might whole range expressions disposal. But whatever has, including fresh, deep voice, enough housefull theater go, "dude, no-no, don't you'll get caught" egging fight back arbitrary injustice. It could Rajat's acting result strong narrative. Or could fact identify him; combination sorts. It could acting capabilities gets audience cheer Rohan slaps wrong-doer. Or could brilliant, arrogance portrayed Ronit Roy; intolerable claustrophobia Ronit's character, B. Singh causes. All elements work towards goal making film one powerful scene other. I watch average 6-8 movies month, theater. I vouch ain't easy get ovation people seats 2 hours, watching reasonably slow proceeding events 17-year old boy's life. This despite, two groups dimwits cackling intermittently. This certainly wasn't screen, bunch inconsiderate film 'watchers'. This relevant assessment film. Because serious film strong sequences meant develop characters relationship, annoying thus distracting interrupted hooting. And rest us enjoyed film despite says lot screenplay. The reason applies missing holes script. I wanted know B. Singh. I usually kind demand much backstory; I like guessing self-second-guessing. But I needed little maybe it's everyday film conditioned wanting justification way things are. Me, common man, needs God justify part things work, cannot accept randomness nature. Yep people, one films I'm ready take blame I don't like. Anurag Kashyap, sir, investment bear fruit. If immediately, consider part buying 'recession', bud blossom long-run. Not needed reassurance, product says all.
