A frames movie I knew I'd wasting 3 hours come I chose connect proceedings screen Memento. So, I sent Memento dark hall. I began adjusting loud chant-like background music over-compensated sparse dialogue. And eyes refocused per over-zealous camera-person/editor's demands. Once I gave in, I saw getting involved characters, getting curious, heart-beating throat all. Ghajini one movies I liked despite sensing flavor 'over-the-top' cinema 185 minutes. It absorbed present scene yet left garish after-taste. It's packed - drama, emotion, romance, action, song, dance, social message thrown charge. Mixing 2 genres annoyed here, always, e.g. I felt completely lost romance cropped up. And imagine state mind songs thrown like rabbits jump magic hats - nowhere. While note, heart bled I heard Prasoon Joshi pull Sameer, save verses. Since songs picturised choreographed well, I vote separate music video album interested. Do you? Anyway, scene-by-scene Ghajini grew me. While I wouldn't enjoyed one thread plot itself, total added little sum parts. The sequences worked without caveat two junctions thriller poised anxiety protagonist's next step raised pulse-rate. Not badly Aamir Khan's pulsating nerves temples though. Wide eyes wanting scream louder voice box create. It's inexplicable character transformed unwieldy monster angry. Almost show Khan capable -physical shape included. And note I haven't yet spoken short-term memory turns superhero super-duper action-powers. Now I've done it, I huge problem so-called 'crowd pleasing', 'mass appeal' items added. Once again, I'm part masses one crowd I don't want it! Oh well... However, Aamir mesmerized subtle reflexes emotional romantic sequences. And Asin charmingly supported entertained audience. Her occasionally-irritating saccharine character endearing enough wish happiness. Though white, part written little meat usually accorded women Hindi cinema. On hand, Jiah Khan sketch role fumbled ungraciously could. Why urdu lessons publicized? She could barely hide accent speaking English! Ghajini's nowhere smart nearly subtle Memento it's completely stupid either. It's even fraction mind-boggling Memento either, keep brain ticking fast enough ignore huge leaps faith every 10th minute. Ghajini certainly one people love melodramatic elements Hindi cinema enjoy hate masala hate. And either one hasn't watched Memento block memories Memento make one. I combined tolerance things Bolly ignored original like much I did.
