"The common man style too." interesting concept put forth. And bring ensemble interesting characters. A rich, spoilt brat business acumen, fashion designer cares common man, honest advertising creative head, fashion model, popular TV actoress, loser unbeatable positive attitude. And attempt keeping vein light. Unfortunately, ultimately nothing comes synergy could create team individual characters. You're right, serious analysis movie genre look feel. But, every time I see good idea blow execution, hurts...And think it? A comedy squeezes sense humor (believe me, I one!) Of course, common man refers person means wear labeled brands, sense fashion. However, basic idea thought properly, could extrapolated many situations common man suffers unnecessary inferiority complex. This complex could treated something simple product created honest him. Alas, wishes horses... If elaboration story amateurish, departments screenplay, dialogues, delivery, expressions actors' faces, ambience created around actors, background music equally amateurish. It's really shame half hour spent establishing 6 main characters 2-3 side characters, end seems futile. For example, Aftab Shivdasani's character who's creative coming advertising taglines, nothing spectacular end! None actors given anything comfort zone thus nothing seems average. As it, Govinda fans could well disappointed too. I guess grateful Ganesh Acharya deciding limiting usage Om Puri voice over. Otherwise, know made slapsticks these. But, doesn't relieve us Prem Chopra's antics. One can't get everything one wishes for. Yet, excuse keeping screen long spans time one expression face. And happened once, nothing happening screen, even camera wasn't moving! So yeah, trimming obviously called for. There digs various characters issues would encounter day-to-day life - Label designers attitude. Family soap operas, camerawork sound effects use course, viewers. Industrialists, rich problems seemingly simple solutions. Telemarketers annoy us. Popularity make commonest person TV show host. I thought non-jumpy movements given actors songs nice, different. But, placement not-so-good-sounding music abrupt 'nice' feeling comes late song register. As Manoj Bajpai, guy ultimate positive attitude, says loses 80 lakhs business deal, "I gained 1 crore worth experience, I'm still green 20 lakhs!", anyone sees movie say, "they gained 1 crore worth experience watching movie looks slapsticky cheesy title!"
