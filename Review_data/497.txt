It's since I thought movie needed little longer. Not necessarily I good time thoroughly engaged, I wanted see characters. Every time I involved them, I moved next episode. No emotion allowed sink in. Yet, story trying convey, performances make certain one-time watch - theaters, least DVD/TV. It likely need know characters springs found interesting book, 3 Mistakes My Life Chetan Bhagat. The book little them, especially side characters. On hand, weren't well-fleshed start either. So cutting already little felt rather sketchy. It quite ordeal finishing book, that's mainly language plain-speak. His words get tiring lack flow. (It doesn't help I took upon read book watching film.) Yet, I admit, Chetan Bhagat interesting stories tell, even outlandish superficial, basic concepts capable holding interest. It's good thing film-making grammar Abhishek Kapoor makes narrative interesting enough make two hours pass almost blink. With many themes close home us, easy hook us - friendship course, communal riots cricket! Only thing missing Bollywood. With themes broad strokes, director manages get quite bit detail frames. The camera work almost always jittery, letting settle in, one atmosphere, romance Govind (Raj Kumar Yadav) Vidya (Amrita Puri) Ishaan's (Sushant Singh Rajput) struggle adamant student Ali (Digvijay Deshmukh) Omi's unsure personality moulded uncle (Manav Kaul) stands for. What keeps film together, fluidity, though background score. It lilting, melodious subtle once. And course, performances glue too. Ace-rate performances one make Kai Po Che worth time, effort money, themselves. Each passions shone business, cricket politics. Their friendship worked too. Yet, I would really like see Raj Kumar Yadav role needs speak slower, know it. Sushant Singh Rajput refreshing Amit Sadh screen presence without speaking much. I found, casting Manav Kaul communal leader, surprising - younger polished I'd imagined character. But, fit right. Given material had, tweaks screenplay writers made, makes Kai Po Che really interesting. But, like film based book you've read, difficult shake book watching it. There maybe debates (a I heard way theater) added/deleted/edited book whether worked film. But stands itself, movie works audience relates content. Only felt like incomplete didn't delve deeper themes. Also, like book, story starts friendship hardships abruptly ends becoming larger national issue. But again, isn't pretty much life like? All dynamics change abruptly calamity hits personally. Ultimately me, clincher seeing 600-seater full-house 'star'-struck nation film doesn't sport stars. Even director isn't big-ticket name. Which means people came either story read trailers saw. And I wasn't even surprised. This HUGE step.
