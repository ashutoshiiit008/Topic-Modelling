There indie films indie films. And writer-director Anand Gandhi’s Ship Theseus. Perhaps singularly impressive independent film come India, Ship Theseus sweeping philosophical, intellectual emotional experience demands audiences’ involvement outset return rewards questions, answers everything between. The film traces three separate stories - three threads life, ideology, spirituality thought – journeys shake basis characters’ separate existences. A female photographer whose talent fame stem unique circumstance – physical disability would able overcome positive manner; monk whose ideological beliefs – non-violence animal rights – face stern test faith; young stockbroker whose notions morality begin spiral inwards unwittingly gets drawn illegal kidney trade racket. Anand Gandhi makes us dwell characters’ minds inhabit worlds, makes us get know worldview intricately and, importantly, makes us part journey characters undertake. And journeys don’t definite end – live characters long enough know that, better worse, experiences changed them. Another thing fascinated film far personal level entire film breathes Mumbai. The stories could set city world – universal. But - I speculating - appears Anand Gandhi shares bond city Mumbai reflects always present, gently undulating surface film. What helps film immensely cast. Though largely unknown faces Indian cinema, convincing. Aida El-Kashef, Neeraj Kabi Sohum Shah play three main characters mentioned earlier. Each convincing roles often doesn’t seem like playing characters all. Their presence spontaneity play large role drawing audience’s involvement film. Also host charming supporting characters wonderfully performed like icing cake. While film clearly hold international stage terms thought, makes even special even technically, one doesn’t feel film can’t compete internationally. Pankaj Kumar’s cinematography needs lauded that. Each stories visual language specific character environment, yet merge beautifully larger context film. Yes, I feel film could easily crisper cut. There excess visuals makes film tad long. Personally, I would perhaps shaved good 10 – 15 minutes film make tauter. Perhaps best thing Ship Theseus introduced Anand Gandhi world. Clearly, man thinks – rare breed Indian cinema. As many brain-dead people films come across, equal number pseudo-intellectual cinephiles unfounded conviction believe good cinema. It takes passionate, philosophical thinker understand rules - break - decided human beings. Right wrong constructs human mind. Morality justice always two sides it, like inseparable duality life death. Gandhi talks themes film, hopefully first many come. Hopefully, also inspire spawn rise independent, thinking filmmakers. Just hope instilled us, arrival Ship Theseus, lovers cinema must rejoice.
