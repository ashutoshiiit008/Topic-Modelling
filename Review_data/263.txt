A wise man (Leon Trotsky?) said, "Everything relative". So compare Dhoondte Reh Jaoge regular "three men get together earn easy money" plot, you'll feel like rag collector backyard 5-star hotel. Because doesn't loose focus. Other masala comedies start mayhem, keep going chaos end utter pandemonium. The commotion created one though works towards ultimate goal. But commotion is, I guess maybe called inevitable genre. This goal hilarious one. A producer (Paresh Rawal) gangs smart Chartered Accountant (Kunal Khemu) make flop film. Why? When? What? You see movie find out. But starts decent sense humor turns one random poor joke stringed another random poor joke. The smartness basic idea doesn't run film. And way, bring Chartered Accountant wears anything blue, gray white...and ok black. The individually funny elements ultimately forced together, flow ignored. The major concern movies like one must - "How end madness?" If give mellow end, it'd feel like anti-climax. If give realistic end, contradicts tone rest film. If end happy note, predictable clich√©. So let's make obvious weren't interested climax done quick easy. And fairly quick easy must Paresh Rawal (Raj Chopra) play conniving conman. A couple scenes splits. Sonu Sood (Aryan Kapoor) wears sullen look almost movie. However, I enjoyed watching go starry-eyed girl around. Kunal Khemu (Anand Pawar) seems done everything alright yet he's convincing geek guy who's love schemer guy confidence issues. Maybe way character written. Soha Ali Khan (Neha) actually looks smart play dumb character. There seems connection whatsoever Anand Neha. Both actors way romantic sub-plot put together share blame one. It would sheer stupidity characters movie producers film actors didn't mention Hindi movies, right? And stupid aren't. So attempt collect references wanted one page. Thread together reasonably funny sequence witty one-liners evenly spaced out. And go berserk. Then slowly deteriorate predictable pun-mode. There additional bits spoof well though. Like comment role women Hindi movies. But good excuse giving women characters attention. Another comment audience's capacity lap one irrational movie another. And there's formula make successful film. Also alludes fact makers judgment viewers' expectations. Actually, Dhoondte Reh Jaoge win-win situation. If goes well audience - Yay! Hurray!! Chak De!!! If doesn't makers say - "Duh! It intentional!!"
