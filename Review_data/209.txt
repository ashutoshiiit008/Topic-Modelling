It difficult shake thick legacy mill-worker-era films like Roti, Kapda, aur Makaan Namak Haraam. And I'm sure films issue I haven't seen. And despite seen least 20 years ago, ironically, refreshing see concept screen. But that's freshness ends. It turns regular Manjrekar-ization topic. Loud, louder, haven't heard yet, loudest. The degradation Indian - read Bombayite - moral fiber barely threadbare early 80s - sex violence. The cause identified globalization commercialization semi-public property. The collateral damage due transition semi-socialism capitalism - entire value system. All heavy stuff crammed 2.5 hours. You'd think would make film fast-paced interesting. Unfortunately, it's done way doesn't touch you. It argued film might make better impact people actually affected mill-worker strikes, what's film doesn't make identify characters unlike you? I completely appreciate gray shades given every character. But haphazard behavior choppy way moving one sub-plot another one issue another, extremely exasperating. Not mention, completely highlights confusion makers seem struggle with. What deserves weightage? The mill-workers' political situation? The impact spouses children mill-workers? The demonization corporatization? What? What?? What??? And then, top loud acting, blaring sound design shocking visuals. A sample last situation poverty desperation reaching insane level violence makes youth, nation's tomorrow, cannibals masturbators-in-public. I understand frustration Mahesh Manjrekar tries convey, film, films. And I value courage takes follow showcasing exasperation feels rather thinks audience ought feel. But on-the-face, over-the-top execution makes wait interval first half hour film end-credits, post-interval. Sure, generation born (and after) generation struggled basics - food, shelter, clothes - needs sensitized made aware cost luxuries come. But, one succeeded repulsing subject.
