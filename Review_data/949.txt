The guy sells 3D glasses ticket counter must thanking stars right now. Every Friday new film added list 3D films – demand increasing. To him, doesn’t matter films shot 3D, hence end projection problems, dim viewing due tint glasses, mention headache walk with. When news The Lion King released 3D came around, panic. The original film released 1994, uses traditional hand-drawn animation, 2D nature. There childhood; virtually every moral lesson I imbibed, re-released 3D. Anybody would panic. But I watch it, compulsive need – compare rant crib world come to, name commercialization (which bit hypocritical, I realized, I owned every merchandise Lion King existed.) Viewing movie, however, makes forget that. The epic sense film comes thoroughly, 3 D version (provided projection mark) offers new dimension viewing film, re-release works. However, experience mildly different; you’re fan things flying sense grandeur would inevitably get 3D effect then, 3D version give money’s worth. The Lion Kingis set anthropomorphic jungle Africa called Pride Rock – royal family headed King Mufasa loved respected all. Life jungle dutiful simple movie begins birth Mufasa’s son Simba. The family’s rival, Scar (also Mufasa’s brother) constantly trying overpower become king. The film traces story – love, betrayal honour. For already watched film many times over, points make cry, Scar hyenas still manage scare you, Simba Nala’s growing love Elton John’s classic ‘Can You Feel The Love Tonight’ still make smile fondness still feel void walk movies – end 2 precious hours nostalgia. Funnily enough, voice-overs side characters include familiar names like Rowan Atkinson (voice Zazu, Mufasa’s right hand) Whoopi Goldberg (voice female hyena Scar’s army) background score given Hans Zimmer. Elton John Time Rice written composed 5 songs films – re-touched performed countless times Broadway live concerts. It would take entire day listen various versions songs. For many (including me)The Lion King released 3D essentially revisit childhood - days Disney 2D animation classic cartoons, time hadn’t heard Hanna Montana The High School Musical trilogy. Re-releasing film 3D, undoubtedly gives added advantage watching film big screen effects wholesome viewing experience. Otherwise, The Lion Kingin 3D includes favorite moments, favorite characters another excuse watch favorite film, regardless visual dimension
