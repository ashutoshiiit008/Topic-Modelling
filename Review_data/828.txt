Science, Commerce, Arts? - A common question 20 years ago, I supposed decide line interest age 15. "Commerce?" - cool, CA, ICWA (MBA little much think "girl" community). "Science?" - oh excellent. Engineers, Doctors, lot 'scope'. "Arts?" - Why would yourself? You smart, intelligent, scored well. No one talks mere mortals. I went finish CA, never practiced accountancy, years later figured I'd like watch movies write them. Only I know, actual books courses I could done closer field. Who I blame? The system? Parents? Myself? A film touches upon theme, sure touch chord within me, butâ€¦ Shikshanachya aaicha gho says system over-ambitious, misguided parents responsible. Fair enough. What's solution? They haven't given practical way resolve this. I understand onus providing solution lie movie, without film seriously hollow. I'm told I already know loud brash manner. It doesn't really make want think I'm theater. Let alone take action correct wrong. What though involves parts two hours there. You want reach guy who's heart cricket forced learn 12*6. You want shake dad awake cornering boy thus. But, resolution conflict comes conveniently harshly. In way, film tries tell parent, "Look happen realize wrong!" And 'happy realization' dawns upon him, creates unrealistic monster. Reaching higher ups system surely way, correct situation. But make system look unbelievably approachable. However, I liked fact suffering parent surrounded nicest people. He neighbors who'd help money-sharks, reached him. While could little good true, I'd like believe world bad-a-place all. Example, I good neighbors, there's reason film them. But barring that, stuff film, like acting dialogue, annoying. The dialogue "preachy" tone delivered specific theatrical quality, doesn't work film. Similarly, acting looks like live audience. While many us would find issue close heart, somehow lacked depth thought seep deep me. Though see angst makers characters might feeling, doesn't take further. It's unfortunate, good start-off point better films topic.
