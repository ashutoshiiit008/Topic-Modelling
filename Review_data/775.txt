Whatever do, shouldn't make kids' movie drones bores. Okay, granted, I authority bores kids, especially considering I one anymore. But I strong feeling work kids. First, kids exposed much better animation. Cannot fault makers one. Because given budget constraints, visual creativity used optimum. But, would kids really care "value money"? Second, regular good vs. evil story, one many characters. I underestimating average kids' intellect. It's except 3-4 characters, none others well-established. This doesn't give enough material kids love fear characters. Third, humorous spoof-like references hindi movies 70s cricketers politicians, completely lost kids. So, could mean movie kids? What's adults, then? The idea novel thus interesting. But, execution haphazard abrupt. The writing best. Mythology becomes fantasy becomes drama suddenly becomes outright preachy social message. And thus justice done one theme. The songs average I couldn't hear lyrics music way loud compared voices. The music builds-up well lacks punch end songs. That said, lines situations funny visualizations creative. There metaphors too. But overall, suffers specific target audience. In attempt something everybody, ends becoming nothing particular anybody. Of course, adults kids mutually exclusive targets audience. But, unfortunately, bits adults Return Hanuman enjoyed adults goes parts kids would enjoy. Thus, overall, one would want option multi-tasking with. At home along work play movie background.
