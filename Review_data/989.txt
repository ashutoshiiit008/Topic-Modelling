Almost one us was/is "marriageable" age encountered least one well-meaning distant relative thinks eligible. The one takes upon find perfect life-partner. Well, To Baat Pakki one lady, Rajeshwari (Tabu). No, she's eligible one, she's dreaded relative. Her existence seems revolve around finding perfect groom little sister. There's lots room comedy, tinee-winee bit explored. The rating course, clearly isn't much look forward To Baat Pakki main character, Rajeshwari fascinated me. Of course, standard, ultra-involved, annoying meddler. But, still older sister. So, though it's never obviously stated, see heavy tinge gray character. She wants sister could never get. She wants live vicariously her. Maybe, that's distant relatives mean using us, exactly makes uber-irritating. And despite interesting character, keep suspecting turn tables, movie pretty flat. The characters barely arouse interest. And exact characteristics Hrishikesh Mukherjee film. Common man, common aspirations. A non-trivial social issue portrayed light manner. But somehow, everything To Baat Pakki looks like failed attempt. Except couple performances. Tabu must one women pull comic timing elegantly. She seems perfect role. Interestingly, though age taken toll lady isn't half engaging look used be, seems worked character's advantage. However, little carry film entire length. It gets slapsticky parts, tardy others. The light moments manage half-smile despite decent performances. Other that, background music extremely loud, irrelevant thus distracting. The song dance sequences follow patterns followed 90s decent camerawork grab attention. The songs areâ€¦well, I don't remember. So, go. Toh Baat Pakki looks intriguing aspect social lives. But flatly yet general ado, it's less painful watch. So, skip one, Fridays ensuing weekends movie worth time.
