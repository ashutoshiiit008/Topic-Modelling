They say right cast make film, least, charming affair. So hear film starring Hugh Grant (childhood poster boy me) Sarah Jessica Parker (soul sister Sex City series) think film would perfect late night breeze watch. Well, let’s say, use money would spend DVD re-rent Sex City Notting Hill, stick those. Did You Hear About Morgans? separated couple Paul Morgan (Hugh Grant) Meryl Morgan (Sarah Jessica Parker) struggle relationship. For first half hour, see Grant, who’s big-shot lawyer, trying win back Parker goofy, boyish charms. Parker however, play Carrie Bradshaw (lead character Sex City) every performance. As successful real estate agent, plays usual confused, blingy New Yorker. All hell breaks loose, part witness protection, sent faraway town Wyoming week, lay low. The film progresses show city-town conflict, couple strives get along make marriage work. Granted, Hugh Grant’s witty, puppy-faced humour works part whole, film stands lazy attempt make romantic comedy. Did You Hear About Morgans? neither funny romantic. It’s even film I would want unwind end long day I don’t want indulge intelligent, symbolic cinema. Beyond point, there’s much Carrie Bradshaw pair extremely British Hugh Grant. He’s largely wooden conscious, reminds us disastrous people look age. The jokes second hand, plot repetitive predictable everyone film seems want desperately make funny affair, starts get annoying. A small note hunter couple, Clay Emma Wheeler (Sam Elliot Mary Streenburgen) – say they’re saving grace film understatement. They serve pleasant contrast bratty, city-bred characters Hugh Grant Sarah Jessica Parkerplay. One (read: rare few) favorite moments film, Wheelers ask Meryl Morgan meat likes says she’s vegetarian supports PETA. Mary's reply one best! The DVD Did You Hear About Morgans? Has 3 featurettes, including one director Marc Lawrence chose lead pair. Also director previously successful films like Miss Congeniality Music Lyrics, insights casting seem convincing, wonder went wrong film. Other features include, deleted scenes (funnier film, Hugh Grant funny otherwise!), extended theatrical trailers audio commentary Hugh Grant Sarah Jessica Parker. The way watch film? 1. If got DVD free, (I would ask reconsider) 2. If you’re bored, 3. If you’re really, really bored. Besides, I think imperative ask question, Do You Really Want Hear Morgans?
