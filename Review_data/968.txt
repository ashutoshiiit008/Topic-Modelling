Through The Secret Grain’s 153-minute duration, get sense isn’t director film. There cameraman, invisible somewhere, editor intuition perfect cuts film, like none other. You, viewer observer amidst characters world recently laid-off 61-year old Slimane’s world. A world that’s perfect family - Slimane divorced. His ex-wife Souad complains alimony payments time keeps away family get-together every Sunday. His current wife Latifa daughter Rym love despite dodge serious red tape quiet port town France, wants start restaurant boat. The main attraction new eatery: couscous, something Souad cooks really well. At least paper, storyline unfolds like family-drama right layers keep engrossed. But engrossed understatement. Director Abdellatif Kechiche’s treatment script such, makes want tear screen make characters stop howling, offer shoulder comfort times, even join celebrations. Kechiche shooting characters tight close-ups - there’s family get-together scene, example, shot edited meticulous care precision cacophony chatter generates loud real enough make neighbours feel you’ve got French guests house. Halfway scenes, I realised I smiling, jokes bandied about, simply joy able observe family merry time together meal. In several scenes, also appears director also lenient saying ‘cut’. He lets drama boil, characters continue bawl, argue shout viewer, want end scene move next one, doesn’t. He lets froth little further, you’re holding head hands, bit awestruck performances bit disturbed unfolded screen. The delicacy couscous plays crucial role film. Comprised grain, fish, vegetables sauce, staple diet minority community Slimane extended family belong to. It it’s preparation brings extended family together, weekends also work one unit get new restaurant running. It becomes clear, despite differences amongst people, food therapeutic bringing people together. The film, parts looks real believable thanks performances. I must mention Hafzia Herzi, plays Rym, Slimane’s daughter puts incredible performance especially towards end. It’s visual highlight film. There’s Alice Houri, plays Julia, Russian married Slimane’s philanderer son Hamid, gives incredible single-take bawling performance I’ve seen. Her outburst long disturbing, I thought nerves would burst. By thanking father end credits film, The Secret Grain, seems autobiographical one can’t help relate Slimane Kechiche’s father. Habib Boufares, plays Slimane, resigned look face throughout film, determination renovate scrap boat start new business, re-assuring, signifying matter cold war present (Latifa Rym) past (ex-wife family), little cajoling effort, everybody comes together fresh beginnings. That’s great thought begin New Year with, isn’t it? Don’t miss film. PS: Happy New Year, folks!
