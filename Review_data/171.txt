This year large number progressive, yet forgettable films. Starting Mirror Mirror Snow White The Hunstmen, bolder adaptations age-old Snow White fairytale. The focus subverting largely patriarchal undertones fairy tales impart with. Pixar’s newest film Brave immediately caught everyone’s attention trailers, involving gallant, motor-mouth girl protagonist (for first time 17 years) archery ambitions. Princess Merida (the protagonist) feisty, Brave predictable, preachy yes, forgettable. Brave tells story Merida (voice Kelly Macdonald), feels stifled mother’s conditioned upbringing. Her mother (Emma Thompson) tries best raise Merida like lady, Merida’s interests lie horse-back riding, archery adrenalin-pumping activities. It comes crumbling summoned wed father’s fellow clan chief’s son. Fundamentally, fact young girl used protagonist charming – Hunger Games – Katniss Evergreen hangover soon predictable story-line takes pours water expectations. There humour many beginning scenes, father King Fergus mother (typical husband-wife banter child). The Scottish countryside beautifully animated, myriad colors depth landscape – it’s relief different geographical region portrayed film. My biggest issue Brave though fact character even remotely memorable Merida. Merida stands visually, hair Scottish accent. The witch could much menacing, lines Cruella DeVille (101 Dalmations) Ursula (The Little Mermaid). A memorable villain always makes pursuit protagonist double-fold, therefore, coupled predictably paced action scenes, film becomes monotonous towards latter half. Brave immense potential – protagonist Merida visually memorable relatable. She’s kind character treated well, could roaring fan following among children. Coupled original story-line, menacing villain certain universal quality much Pixar’s earlier films have, could charming film. As is, however, Brave letdown.
