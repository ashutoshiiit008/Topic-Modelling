The audacious stories often found real life; stories adapted screen right manner, usually takes enthral viewers. Ben Affleck's Argo, instance, perfect example real life tale adapted make thrilling film. A cursory glance George Clooney's latest, The Monuments Men, make one feel film precisely takes deliver Argo - hooking World War 2 based premise cast chops pull style. Think - unlikely bunch non-soldiers brought together sent World War II Europe retrieve valuable pieces art stolen Hitler's regime, orders. Picassos Rembrandts Michelangelos; artworks like markers humankind's cultural progress; art that, lost, would like loss fragment humankind itself. Yet, least cinema, thin line subtlety exaggeration; choosing former, Clooney ends making staid film underwhelming best. Of course, rather brave Clooney choose understated manner chose narrate story enough become thrill-a-minute heist film. Hollywood studios aren't particularly known favour kind narrative style chosen. The film heart right place, ends becoming victim manner. The question, really, subtle 'too subtle'. The film doesn't particularly graph; expect rise rise progresses, never does. You expect lead exciting finale, leave disappointed. Laced genuine smile-worthy moments large amount respect masters art, film focuses instilling awareness important art is, overall story humanity. Despite taking us familiar people places - least history textbooks, nothing else, film fails truly engage connect. In fact, film set fag end WWII, Germany begin withdraw lot European occupation. The stellar cast - Clooney himself, Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray Cate Blanchett, amongst others, great job - precisely expected them. However, film jumps stories often, concurrently means particular character stays film over. As director, Clooney certainly maturing time. He easily seems control The Ides March, instance. As I mentioned earlier, route chose narrate particular story brave one; world away one chosen Affleck Argo. One wonders though, whether proves film's biggest undoing. Including audience evoking response rare spurts, The Monuments Men mostly bland.
