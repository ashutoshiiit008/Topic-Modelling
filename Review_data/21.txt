Don’t write yet another war movie. For one, ‘escape’ movie war movie. Secondly, warm movie. It makes think futility - partition, wars themselves, retention prisoners war. The beauty movie lies focused story is. There dilly-dallying, silly non-silly sub-plots. This one rare scripts appreciated without awesome awe-inspiring dialogues. It gripping well-paced screenplay surprises you, shocks you, disturbs you. The dialogues simple without inane. In fact restraint used avoiding over-the-top heavy lines simply admirable. The expected “Pakistan-bashing” dialogues conspicuous absence. The background music beautiful. However, problem over-use. The quality ruined quantity. There background music almost throughout movie loud – louder dialogue times. The acting lead actors top-notch good enough distract story. It’s dialogue delivery supporting cast is…weird. The actors playing roles Pakistani military brought laughs none warranted. And why-oh-why helicopter pilot Dev Anand? No single scene might jerk tears surely brings lump throat credits roll – names crew members names pictures real prisoners war - men put lives line could live comfortably.
