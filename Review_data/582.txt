“Have ever dream, Neo, sure real? What unable wake dream? How would know difference dream world real world?” – Morpheus, The Matrix (1999) The story Pawan Kumar’s second feature film made become part cinema lore. Failed attempts finding producer led scathing blog post director, led exploring crowd-funding. This culminated 50-lakh-odd film Lucia, shot Canon 5D - first crowd-funded Kannada film find theatrical release. People tend judge indie film differently ‘normal’ film, whatever means. ‘Indie’ doesn’t necessarily equate ‘made heart, merely acceptable quality’. That’s where, say, Ship Theseus – now, Lucia – comes along teaches look indie film lens sympathy. No matter budget circumstances film made, expect someone pay watch film, better damn good. After all, story film’s making doesn’t appear subtitles film. The story matters story film itself; that’s Lucia scores heavily. Nikhil, affectionately called Nikki, normal common man somewhat-normal affliction – insomnia. One nocturnal sojourns, however, leads something starts giving sleep, sleep dreams always dreamt seeing. Obviously, good things come rider… Throughout time, dreams always fascinated artists across media, always open interpretation one still fully able understand dreams, despite age advancement live in. Lucia takes mystery fascination fits layered - yet largely lucid - tale ambition, desire destiny. Drawing slightly quote start review, also tipping hat Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Lucia often twisted smart, often fool part audience. What truly makes worth time soul; emotional story characters get involved whose story almost desperately want see resolution of. Nikki – ‘sides’ – characters instantly root for, see coming from. The goes love life Shwetha – woman real, practical dreams aspirations, irrespective face character consider. The film also pointed take one fundamental truths humankind – grass always greener side. One always covets has, never pausing think unique special already is. Lucia spends first hour setting mystery quickly feel like getting bottom – Nikki’s dreams. And zippy cuts fast-moving narrative still never takes attention story. In second half – likely problem – film changes gears focuses characters. In fact, happen unravel mystery meant unraveled, also likely feel sense been-there-seen-that. Despite this, film largely holds up, even see hints story heading, still curious characters end up. It helps greatly story backed convincing lead performances. Sathish Neenasam, plays Nikki, completely looks behaves like Nikki should, every point story. The pretty Sruthi Hariharan Shwetha superb well. Even character makes choices may disagree with, still manages convince she’s coming from. I don’t faintest idea whether two established names Kannada cinema not, perfect characters play Lucia. Some supporting cast shaky, look past characters play hold fort. On personal note, film nice little ode cinema itself. Starting obvious nature Nikki’s character (and I’m tempted reveal slight spoiler here, I won’t,) subtle ways cinema seems mirror real life vice versa, Lucia delight true cinephile – one sees cinema beyond love opinions films one sees. The true victory Lucia manages make gloss relatively technical limitations, pity, drawn story characters. It underlines fact end day, script king. The minutes (or, you’re lucky, hours) spend post film wondering whether you’re dream added bonus.
