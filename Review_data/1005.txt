In spite fact director Chandrakant Kulkarni credit guilty pleasure Bindhaast filmography, latest film, Tukaram, didn’t spawn many expectations me, primarily choice actor essay role one respected revered saints Maharashtra. Jitendra Joshi, though incompetent, played many character roles really taken seriously. However, performance Tukaram grows length film, ultimately leaving feeling actually decent job. Young Tukaram Ambile parents’ second child, older brother interested ways God earthly life. Because this, Tukaram shoulders responsibility father’s money-lending trading work fairly early. The film goes chronicle journey life, leading comes mass-popular poet-saint history knows as. Right first frame film, authentic feel setting engulfs you. Not film fall prey ‘modern’ gimmickry terms technique. Even camera movements gentle stable, managing draw attention detailing production design. The language dialogue added bonus, contributing immensely audience vicariously experiencing life 17th century Maharashtra. Undoubtedly, strength film performances. As mentioned earlier, Jitendra Joshi manages breathe life character Tukaram, easily making forget bizarre character choices made past. Prateeksha Lonkar, plays Tukaram’s mother, joy watch, like always. Not since Reema Lagoo Rajshri films 90s someone made warm screen mother. Sharad Ponkshe Tukaram’s father excellent well, managing switch warm father businessman ease. Veena Jamkar Radhika Apte, playing Tukaram’s first second wives respectively, perform well. Apte, particular, handles graph character finesse. Her gradual shift young innocent mature tough truly exceptional. Yet, Tukaram without flaws. Its obvious problem length. Clocking two three quarters hour, film feels even longer uneven, often slow, pace. Period biopics often find tough hold audience attention, Tukaram falls prey well. The pace slows even latter half film, without truly contributing story saint’s life. However, biggest problem film graph Tukaram’s character. A human malleable child formative years contribute adult. Starting childhood, film abruptly cuts grown man, thus robbing film impact initial reels could potentially had. Furthermore, Tukaram’s adult life two parts – one man worldly needs aspirations, one renounced materialism favour spreading, poetry, word God. The bridge two vastly different characters, journey two extremes potential far stronger. While lot time spent detailing two characters, connecting link essentially condensed one scene. This scene, though impactful isolation, still enough, two characters poles apart. Despite flaws, film entirety makes interesting experience. Facets Tukaram’s life aren’t popularly known brought forth, manner cast film brings credibility characters play truly noteworthy. Thus, though Tukaram far long good takes time unfold, still makes decent watch performances detailed nuanced production design, clearly worked love.
