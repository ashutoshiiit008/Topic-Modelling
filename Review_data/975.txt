The USP The Warriors Way gory action Ninjas Cowboys. With Cowboys Aliens around corner, I thought prayers answered. For years, fans fantasizing mixing two cults. Firefly Cowboy Bebop excellent examples Space Cowboys Blood - The Last vampire Samurai vs Vampires. There plenty examples cite - lesser known others. Now Hollywood experimenting mixing things up, I super-excited The Warriors Way. I extremely disappointed. The movie tools become cult-blockbuster. It excellent cast Dong-gun Jang (Korean superstar) rogue Ninja (also, best swordsman history mankind) Geoffrey Rush reformed bandit (also, ace-shooter cowboy). The film produced Barrie M. Osborne The Lord Of The Rings franchise. Not much could gone wrong. Correction: Not much ‘should’ gone wrong. But lot did. And fault lies script Sngmoo Lee screenplay. I can’t pick worse. The flashbacks come nowhere. The climate changes every swing sword. It feels like really trying hard make senseless flick. The first five minutes movie took away built-up excitement attempt humorous amidst gory action sequences. So begin think, okay going one “From Dusk Till Dawn” (classic Cowboys vs Vampires) kind movies. But movie becomes serious, manages unintentionally funny. Some action sequences really well done though. I loved last twenty minutes movie. I also loved fact movements Ninjas quite close animes (like Naruto). But visual perfection makes much everything else that’s mediocre. You still sitting shoddiest screenplay ever, pathetic acting supporting cast. Who doesn’t want see Ninjas Cowboys fight out? So, I know you’re keen. But save money, wait DVD/TV release. Bonus: You fast forward good parts skip sad-drama middle.
