Domestic violence womenâ€™s empowerment would superficial issues Videsh touches upon. Though means trivial, several deeper matters film also tries talk about. There's reference fact strength human willpower generally under-rated. But one's strength doesn't necessarily willpower intelligence courage; subtler abstract human capability. True - physical, verbal thus mental abuse different members family make marriage shown incomparable average marriage. But incompatibility expectations realities marriage true marriage. Preity Zinta gives character, Chand, vulnerability strength, fear defiance. I watch Videsh times appreciate nuances deglamorized performance. Vansh Bhardwaj plays husband Rocky equally laudable show. Given acts well-thought film is, it's difficult imagine wooden expressions worn rest cast unintentional. The glaring non-performances must reason I haven't able figure out. If nothing else, indifferent faces effectively add Chand's loneliness. This feeling alone company magnified use silence poetic prose Chand's dialogues. Her disintegration due circumstances product Rocky's aversion talking - means wise non-usage words build character. His silence frustrates us audience sort-of makes us feel frustration though aware specifics. Then references Almighty His influence lives something irks often kitschy way done Hindi films. And general, unless plot's underlying assumption supernatural phenomenon, works film. But, quirky way, Videsh uses things represent moral support liberation Chand feels. It also added heavy cynicism apparent title film Videsh - Heaven Earth. A foreign land Indians anything go, end creating anything heaven there. And yet I feel something magical intervention would worked much better symbol. The eerie close-ups, slightly annoying handheld camera work, unsettling silence due lack background music, add claustrophobic atmosphere Chand must experience "free" Western world. None outwardly issues touched upon anything new - abusive family, sarcasm Indians' attempt create India outside India, human crassness, strength women, etc. But philosophical bent given movie makes far superior movie genre.
