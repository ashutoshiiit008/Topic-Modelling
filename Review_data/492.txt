Kaakha Kaakha (remade Hindi recently Force another story surrounds idea vendetta, manages stay well end film treated manner makes instant connection. Gautham Menon uses many clichés Kaakha Kaakha: good versus evil, opposites attract eternal celebration sacrifice it’s racy script, Surya’s crisp performance Harris Jeyraj’s music makes film investing watch. I remember reading interview (and I read lot them, courtesy obsession Surya) mentions first spark two flew filming song, 'Uyirin Uyire' passionate film schedule, married knew it. Of course, I buy DVD, watching film I left feeling – story involved, it’s simple plot earnest display emotions, I’d forgotten I spent well 2 hours watching film. Unlike Force, Kaakha Kaakha doesn’t resort many gimmicks - (No beefed-up hero picking motor-bike throwing like strawberry likes). It’s gripping plot, played sense ease genuine need tell story. Anbuselvan (Surya) IPS officer, working Narcotics Department Police force long remember right side law. The film begins team formed, headed Anbuselvan break Narcotics rackets across city. Special training undertaken mission – shown us well-cut montages. Just given peg film – he’s stern officer advantage family emotional responsibility. When meets Maya, audience instantly know plight going be. Maya (played beautiful Jyothika) middle-school teacher opposite Anbu be, charm radiance. While run-off-the-mill opposites attract pairing, forgive cliché chemistry almost contagious. While explore relationship (through songs, resistance give feelings, naiveté professional life dangers involved), also secretly hoping love won’t come way Anbu’s high-risk job. The film picks pace Anbu fight keep relationship spotlight Pandya (played Jeevan), mafia-gang leader cracks Anbu’s weakness. While premise enough grip you, unlike Vidyut Jammwal Force, villains Kaakha Kaakha aren’t menacing would apt. Especially considering Surya’s brilliant performance Anbu could done equal opposite force; threateningly psychotic character would brought Anbu’s plight much more. However, Gautham Menon makes absorbing action sequences. It’s fresh change see romance angle, action film, hasn’t forced sake entertainment duly justified plot. A songs characters place, like Maya’s friend Anbu’s fellow officer, mostly would better watching Kaakha Kaakha Force. It’s far earnest, chemistry palpable performances impressive (Jyothika’s lot tolerable chirpy Genelia). Besides, Surya way better eye candy. The DVD Kaakha Kaakha features, subtitles apt synced (I could make broken understanding Tamil translations rather literal). Mostly invest buy DVD Kaakha Kaakha pleasantly watchable film – isn’t flawless masterpiece extremely investing narrative.
