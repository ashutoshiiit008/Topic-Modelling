Should I happy Aisha woman (Sonam Kapoor) capable actor like Abhay Deol play second fiddle? Or I disappointed thing Sonam Kapoor's character finds pleasure look man every female character hook with? Should director happy managed achieve "Hollywood chick-flick" effect? Or disappointed far could get? While I could take sides issues, I'm sure two things - I'm certainly happy subtle comments made, especially ones battle sexes. But I'm equally disappointed done randomly connection story characterizations thus far. So much that, depth, film could taken plunge into, seems frivolous flaky. To express exactly superficial feel comes from, I say 'look feel'-wise Aisha done complete justice inspirations - Sex City, Hannah Montana, likes. Ok, I'm going count many toes I've stepped on, usually society upward upper middle class is, definition, stereotyped superficiality. That, itself, takes characters away level two us. It's problems, people moved Maslow's theory need pyramid, genuine problems belittled based general moral principle. Who judge one's problems serious others'. But, problem (you free judge important is) films like trivialize otherwise weighted issues. It's like taking away subject film. All analysis might make think Aisha serious stuff going on. Naah. I'm commenting could been, especially given light vein entire film maintains. Serious issue, subtle humor - rarely fails. But every major character film something totally blue. The shocker something doesn't feel real, us would say something like sort history THE writer felt like it. Also, trump cards director's hands. It wouldn't come shock anyone Sonam Kapoor actually lives lifestyle like Aisha's. Maybe little less meddler, parts behave like kid can't bothered credit card bills such. SO, much acting involved there. Would anyone argue easy-going, Arjun stroll park Abhay Deol? Ira Dubey pleasant watch too. It won't come surprise men come flaring women got theater. And many women might find 'not bad'. At least, saw funky costumes. Me? Well, I wanted love it, didn't come hating either. The picturization lovely songs enough get by.
