I marvel little time story writer spend characters. A 1-in-3 character (1 personality 3 characters, duh!?) shaking hips comedy take place. Absolutely run-of-the-mill slapstick in-charge first half movie. Interestingly though, second half taken mostly kind good subtle humor. And that's made one worth me. Who needs narratives Akshay Kumar's 3-minute description 3 characters, right? As Akshay's voiceover started annoying me, I let mind wander around... (Sort-of random thought – Maybe slapstick meant silent, know - Charlie Chaplin, Laurel Hardy even Mr. Bean - one element less irritate me.) ...people around whistling hooting every single barely-clad woman comes screen... (Random thought - I touched! Not writer/director, audience immense respect women.) ...back slapstick. Someone reading sort-of random thought. Words replaced typical comedy feature - fast forward action set loud pacy background music. No-no - I saying I wanted see slower pace (Gawd, NO!). Why new breed directors need resort cumbersome technique? Has needs explored editing techniques explored? I sure day age absolutely hilarious, don't need little make us laugh? Maybe not. The full house (at 8.45 AM show) laughing heart out. And laughed - second time technique used span 15 minutes... (More random thought – Whose fault I random thinking? Since I refuse blame human being, I blame inimitable art repetition.) ...Oh wow! Barely-clad women gone!! Does Sajid Khan random-thought-reading contraption? Well, I know I - exactly I expect happening screen. And times story predictable, left explanations altogether. Anyway, cut song... (Not-so random thought – There better way expressing, "this child changed life" - 'tune jeena sikhlaaya, tune mujhe insaan banaaya' (you've taught live, you've made human being) How two lines lay-person generated 5 minutes... 'Nazar badli meri ya ye nazaare? Tere nazaare se badli hai dil ki niyatein' (Has view changed vision? With view heart changed intention)) INTERVAL ...Huh? Did start another movie mistake? Where's mandatory shouting gone? Suddenly, I interesting non-repetitive dialogues. Wow! Actual tongue-in-cheek humor, tangy one-liners!! Though super-melodrama stay, I ecstatic movie getting better laughing really loud... (Not-at-all random thought - The randomly I think, better movie gets. Maybe, it's wandering mind making movie improve. Or maybe I shouldn't start taking credit yet) ...oh, interesting style narration. Huge chunks story narrated way dialogue finished five minutes. And huge chunks time taken narrate slow-moving parts story. Even-paced movies generally better retaining attention, interesting style nevertheless... (Back random thought - Am I getting responsive Baby Johaina getting responsive? She good job acting. Oh wait, no-one make 8-month old act. She natural!) ...oops, what's wrong Vidya Balan? Why stiff, body language? Where learn non-acting? Hopefully, Fardeen Khan. On hand, Ritiesh Deshmukh regular amount tolerable, Akshay Kumar's comic timing awesome scenes. But star Babyy Johaina - expressions best... (Real random thought - When universe made many senses generated. What they? How current five (six?) chosen others discarded?) ...yep, that's uninteresting climax is...This one would absolute dud comedy post-interval. THE END
