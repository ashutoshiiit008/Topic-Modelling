One would expect Priyadarshan Akshay kumar combination able come something potentially entertaining. For sake, standing line tickets I praying Khatta Meetha would funniest movie year. It wasn’t. I’ll tell surprised me, though. Not fact people rolling laughing stale jokes, even first day, first show almost housefull. It mostly audience cheered loudly, whistles et al, intervals 5 minutes everything Akshay Kumar said. All Khatta Meetha bunch hyperactive characters, trying pull “political satire” slapstick comedy storyline. It remake Priyadarshan’s original Malayalam film Vellanakalude Nadu, highly successful 1989. Adapted Marathi setting movie notorious road contractor Sachin Tichkule (Akshay Kumar) journey corruption red-tapism. He struggles job, regularly cons people money, it’s Akshay Kumar. He ever earnest protagonist notorious needs make audience laugh. His comic timing decent jokes stale. Priyan’s stock characters, Rajpal Yadav Asrani, better. Even antagonists, Akshay’s brothers brothers-in-law, negligible screen presence, interactions take melodramatic, loud acting new level. Trisha Krishnan seems like dummy hands script, lack thereof. It seems like placed shoot asked recite lines, constantly shifts girl next door-wannabe abhla nari, curt municipal official. She carries neither roles, certainly role commands taken seriously. The frustrating part movie earnestly tries comment contemporary corruption issues. Priyadarshan tries pull shifting jarring manner loud comedy even louder intense scenes. None seem fit larger context film. Sure, movie brings truth road construction dirty politics, what’s new it? Rajneeti would quieter option. Maybe give credit trying, I’m guessing got washed away minute heard comparison Sachin Tichkule R.K.Laxman. For God’s sake, voice common men way. Sachin Tichkule Akshay Kumar good comic timing sense good script, loud dialogues, provocative songs blind audience following. The movie attempts say lot 2 half hours runs, repeated action. It’s cycle noisy dialogues, slapstick jokes, cut serious scenes forced intensity back comic relief. The chemistry Akshay Kumar Trisha Krishnan cold, constant bickering sexist attitude towards her. It seems like bigger farce get together end movie, blue, without real explanation. The thing seems mentionable Akshay Kumar carries common man attire apt way. When see dull shirt, cheap pen pocket chappals, believe looks part. When screams frustration cannot afford pay money, amidst bureaucratic mess, understand. But alone enough pull movie through. It seems dated might blindly adapted 1989 2010. The setting seems old; women characters behave like live 40s social issues overdone. Remember Hera Pheri? Surely Priyadarshan Akshay Kumar capable much better.
