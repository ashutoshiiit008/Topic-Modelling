OMG Oh My God reminds coffee table conversations centered around faith, blind faith business faith. It similar argument you'd people blindly believe hand God misuse belief hands men God. The attempt represent sides keep arguments balanced making point. The frustration common man oppression done name religion quiet adequately represented. But, happening way convenient ultimately remain good theory. At first, seems Kanji bhai (Paresh Rawal) staunch opposer existence God. A non-believer, atheist. He appears close-minded anything whole world say faith. But, story moves forward realize issue business God become even open accepting change attitude. All shown interesting arguments Kanjibhai makes high-ranking priests. The balance thrown making mere caricatures priests. The exaggeration cartoon-ish characters might necessary painting dimwits takes away fight, makes easy us take side. However, I saw balance climax. The story taken beyond apparent conclusion, argument though stretched takes proper culmination. Interestingly, film set festive period year. The months celebrate births victories Lords Krishna, Ganpati Ram. Also, questions related existence God dealt smartly. Believer non-believer, see smiling questioning believe in. Paresh Rawal could possibly done role sleep. Not taking anything away heartfelt performance, played conviction. Akshay Kumar plays charming Krishna bit staying away limelight. Mithun Chakravorty despite overtly caricaturish character brings laugh every time moves eyebrow moves little finger â€“ pretty much does. Most rest cast though pain bear thank God Paresh Rawal almost every scene. For people like almost 100% agreement Kanji, easy identify Kanji. The question film effect people blind faith, superstitious, people represented likes wife. Like I said earlier week, it's anyone expect film change lifelong beliefs, one potential least reconsider beliefs.
