Children curious; escaping fact. And parents, matter children themselves, always try protect children believe bad them. Of course, ‘good’ ‘bad’ constructs whose definitions varied personalities people defining them. Acclaimed director Ravi Jadhav’s latest offering, Balak-Palak, BP, deals important facet ‘growing up’ manner lucid, charming, honest much more. BP takes peek lives five young children; five friends growing ‘chawl’, adolescent curiosity, escapades regard eventual effect friendship respective relationships. With genuinely insightful moments peppered right amount humour, BP one films touch heart, without ever getting tedious heavy. What film also cleverly touch upon sensitive subject without ever making audience squeamish uncomfortable. In fact, film talks subject parents children never seem talk about, manner appeal children adults alike. As title film give hint film about, I’ll refrain going it; I’d rather discover yourselves, don’t already know. The film helped immensely performances ensemble cast. The film features known names Marathi cinema like Subodh Bhave, Amruta Subhash, Anand Ingale, Sai Tamhankar Kishore Kadam. All excellent, without exception. But cameos. They merely side players, aimed supporting real heroes heroines film – children. Prathamesh Parab (Vishu), Rohit Phalke (Avya), Shashwati Pimplikar (Dolly), Bhagyashree Shankpal (Chiu) Madan Deodhar (Bhagya) pillars film. BP, all, search answers questions children have, friendships, views lives. All five extremely talented; spontaneity soul film. Also, characters written convincingly leave film carrying away friends (or children, case.) Ravi Jadhav lauded clearly putting children enough ease make lose inhibitions front camera. If director Ravi Jadhav responsible children soul film, cinematographer Mahesh Limaye deserves pat back giving soul body hold visually; fact, rarely Marathi film looked good. Beautiful frames combine earthy sepia tone deliver film looks good enough makers proud of. Special mention must also made music, gels film nicely. It heartening see Vishal-Shekhar working Marathi films well – they’ve done songs film. Surprisingly, problems film lie area film actually quite strong – writing. While film’s simple, clean story screenplay excellent, I wish film focused parents’ side story. Yes, film tries convey parents also children once. But parents children whose story see hardly ever shown film. I walked away wishing I’d known gone through. Also, film tries hard avoid preachy, invariably end end. Another small niggle lies sound – dialogue often (but always) accompanying background hiss distracts, perhaps problems recording sync sound. One reasons I cut back number Marathi films I watch theatre fact seemed one new release every week, mediocrity become somewhat norm amongst them. BP, thankfully, rises that. It made smile throughout, often made audience I watched film laugh loud. This kind film I’d insist family – parents children – watch together.
