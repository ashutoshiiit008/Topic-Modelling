Once settled fact going slow journey Umrao Jaan’s cheerless life, touching narrative wonderful show talent. Aishwarya Rai given outstanding performance. Yes, read right – performance – actually act! It mystery deprived us talent while. Her expressive eyes could alone acting her. Also looks equally stunning elegant pastels brighter costumes. Despite best, emotions aroused ten lines delivered Aishwarya, kindled one movement Shabana Azmi’s eyebrows. That prowess veteran’s acting. While Abhishek Bachchan looks little unsettled first scenes, sure win hearts flavor gives nawab’s character. All well good, warned - long, slow movie. A visual treat laid you. Be Aishwarya Abhishek, glittering costumes jewelry ornate sets – everything grand. The outstanding acting magnificent overall look lend outstanding Aishwarya-Abhishek scenes. While original base story retained, screenplay polished bit, much needed clarifications plot. If producers given set run-time director/editor stick to, movie would appreciated better – long, slow movie. Anu Malik needs saluted entirely different genre music produced. The classical music meaningful lyrics simple yet enjoyable. The use contrast colours background Aishwarya’s attire add value overall picturisation songs. Vaibhavi Merchant’s choreography ‘Kajra re’ flavor gracefully rendered. It shame though minimal Urdu used – dialogues poetry – apt forum bring beautiful language younger generation. Maybe strategy appeal bigger audience avoiding language. For mass appeal, vote would go reducing length movie good 45 minutes. Difficult leave fact – long, slow movie. There technical flaws. The definitions ‘sher’ ‘ghazal’ adhered dialogues. Some side characters fully developed, like Umrao's friends played Divya Dutta Ayesha Jhulka, . The make-up, dubbing dialogue delivery extras awful cannot stand two lines have. Anyway, everyone involved seemed lot time hand. No wonder extra leisurely walk life great poetess. Did I mention – long, slow movie. As promised, futile attempt comparisons. J. P Dutta’s Umrao Jaan simply pleasure look at, outlined great acting. And hey, might worth get time theatre price …. Yes! You got right!
