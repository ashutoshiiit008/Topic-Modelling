So guileless Salman Khan worshipper like myself, gets ready 8 morning,(and mind you, GETS READY WAKES UP), go latest Salman Khan movie, least (or cases, he) expect movie Salman Khan movie, right? Wrong. Apparently, nowadays, it’s okay lead audience on. You show something deliver. So project Main aur Mrs. Khanna Salman Khan starrer, get away ensuring Khan attitude makes single appearance either side interval. Main aur Mrs. Khanna, say least, work extremely confused filmmaker. Perhaps, Prem Soni, director, screenplay, story, dialogue writer (phew!) movie, started fair idea wanted show, somewhere middle, lost it. What could otherwise pretty good movie turned so-so fare average treatment meted it. The plot interesting let loose screenplay. Also, film like Main aur Mrs. Khanna could done lot drama it. The main flaw, however, Main aur Mrs. Khanna lies characterization. The characters, especially lead characters, etched definitively. If define singular character movie one word, wouldn’t able so. For matter, even given many words liked, still wouldn’t able so. Primarily right till end movie, idea WHO people are. Sure know names, know profession. But connect viewer character, sorely missed. We don’t feel Kareena cries, laugh laughs. This movie commits cardinal sin something watching big screen – forms relation audience. The first half slightly flat tempo picks little second half. In fact, second half squeeze quite laughs you. Just think movie might start living expectations, plot falls flat again. The end is, fact, patchy details end plain unnecessary. Another sphere movie lacks chemistry lead pair. A movie trying put across message love relationships simply cannot without absolutely sizzling chemistry lead (or promos say) couple. The missing chemistry, however, actors’ fault director story/screenplay writer’s fault. He hasn’t etched characters strong enough portray sort relationship. The look movie otherwise good. The locales good, Kareena’s styling. From glam doll Kambakht Ishq girl-next-door (or least Kareena’s version it), Kareena’s look definitely undergone change. However, odds character plays. How orphan afford expensive clothes? Salman well, Salman. No need say anymore. He looks good acts like always does. However, age definitely beginning show little, whole ‘young couple’ look kind goes toss. Sohail Khan probably delivered best performance date movie (which isn’t saying much, considering acted movies like Aryan; quite good here). Yash Tonk funny bits unnoticeable bits. Nauheed Cyrusi Mahek Chahal might well carved stone Dino Morea blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearance. The surprise package movie came form Bappi Lahiri, element Kareena’s boss. Music passable, one track, Don’t Say Alvida standing out. Preity Zinta’s item song okay. Choreography spectacular even noticeable. Other technical aspects okay, though flashback technique, going black white zone, looks quite nice. Salman Khan fans might tad bit disappointed, though, size role. Watch must. Till keep guessing ki ‘Kiski Mrs. Khanna’ (whose Mrs. Khanna).
