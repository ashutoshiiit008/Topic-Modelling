Happy Ending sex comedy all, though trailer tried best portraying one. It regular rom-com truly heart trying differentiate others genre. It manages, even bit. Let's face it. The dynamics relationships changing. Love "forever" thing used thought as. More today's urban youth believes "the one" them, current point, day, part life. Of course, I statistics, general perception I see younger friends family. And Yudi (Saif Ali Khan) Aanchal (Ileana D'Cruz) experience live by. Yes, sound cynical. What happens two cynics don't believe "happily ever after" romantic enthusiastic relationships otherwise bump other? It's don't like relationships like retiring it's peak, initial excitement, us become 'you' 'me'. Maybe excitement lives don't want end. Maybe let instead tinkering around make "work". In sense, Happy Ending different. It romcom makes reconsider basics, like say "opposites attract". Though might think deeply it. And tries lot many things. For one, wants make laugh, manages times; times loud too. It wants go "aawww" care characters, root together, even aren't sure it. This, definitions romcom, fine. Then, Happy Ending tries become more. It wants point finger "Star-driven" Hindi film industry wants nod cynical smile parallel indie film "hatke" (different) movement industry. Some things work wonderfully, others fall flat. Some one-liners brilliant stay long, long time I would love watch given context. Also, Govinda exaggerated bit "star" runs show pretty well. Ileana D'Cruz charming usual yet, expressions always come across functional self-conscious, thus never convincing. Kalki Koechlin seems repeat mode appropriately annoying role Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. You say Saif Ali Khan dozen films he's played city-bred non-commital lady-charmer. Except, shows character, Yudi's alter ego. His accent, demeanour, attitude sense responsibility towards Yudi keep splits perceptive introspective. It times film self-references digs hole. Films satirical film industry belong cannot things satirical about. If poking fun films breaking songs formulaic manner, cannot songs expected. Similarly, I never fond films remind watching film. Happy ending breaking fourth wall every while. Except one time Yudi's alter ego makes Yudi aware audience's existence, done meaningfully, annoying. Yet, give points Happy Ending least trying different, even whole-heartedly. There points film catch inadvertently thinking little deeper love place world today. For me, achievement. Sure, I might need film get thinking love relationships, feels good one gets to. Think it, everything around changing, nothing permanent, constant life change, love permanent? The romantic wants believe answer be, "yes, despite odds yes." But, I'm willing hear contemporary side story, someone tells right. Whether happy ending.
