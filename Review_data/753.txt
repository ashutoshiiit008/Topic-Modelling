The wait high-octane, all-engrossing drama became longer. But, still doesn't mean don't decent watch hand Raajneeti. The set-up certainly complex intriguing. And couple sly conniving twists, doubt. But, depth still missing. It's almost introducing characters connections end merely beginning means get there. Given characters based Mahabharat, would take real skill make uninteresting. So, characters here. In fact, focus angle, you'll see even curious amalgamations. For example, Nana Patekar's character, Brij, Krishna, shades Shakuni mama little bit Bheeshma too. Made think bit Krishna's manipulative tactics too. And while, analogies burst seams. It's best leave aside watch film is. It would also help keep Corleones, Gandhis, Thackerays bay. As glaring are, serve distractions. And despite much potential complexity, lack details along creativity-challenged treatment offered situations gives heebie-jeebies. And almost always, negative lingers longer positive. Some scenes, like one character introduced previous scene alluded him; sundry women getting pregnant; woman falls love "arranged" husband respects wish touched. Such scenes clearly didn't belong here; on-the-face references mythological epic. Oh yeah, mention deranged "item" number. Also various connections cross-connections, film deserved lot terms flow one sub-plot another instead "my turn-my turn" shout-out characters whenever made missing-in-action bit. Then things didn't go tone film like say, Prithvi's (Arjun Rampal's) sudden eccentricity. It almost say Arjun's otherwise wooden facial muscles chiseled form - Exhibit A, B, C presented proof. To fair, decent job till then. The usually plastic face Katrina Kaif. Not one, least parts. But going film see surreal vision diva sari, please pass one. The bits see promo almost you'll see film too. The film Samar Ranbir certainly carried chameleon-skinned character well. My complaint though almost Jekyll Hyde conversion without symptoms disorder. Many actors mostly retain first expression, despite fairly gray characters. This almost 3-hour affair doesn't slacken doesn't keep waiting next move either. Because somehow there's foregone conclusion given epic characters film based on.
