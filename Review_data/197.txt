'dum hai boss' goes Seema (Tapsee Pannu) every time Sid (Ali Zafar) woos cheesiest lines. This Seema claims needs something extra wooed. All say 'dumb hai boss'. After happens times, realise that's David Dhawan thinks audience. Dumb, course, 'dum'! Chashme Baddoor makes wonder low story ranks filmmakers' priorities. Situations pop nowhere. Even "mindless" script, couple scenes outside reason - like twist Joseph-Josephine track people landing jail arrive convoluted plot point. These make film even annoying. Well, frustration begins scene one absolutely painful performances. From Siddharth's over-zealous gestures Ali Zafar's pretentious dialogue delivery Tapsee Pannu's cute-yet-flat portrayal Seema film's center attention - one assault ears another. Then Tapsee Pannu needs another role opinion made talent. Divyendu Sharma makes supposedly funny lines given decent timing. Anupam Kher Bharti Achrekar get make fool again. I'd liked say Rishi Kapoor Lilette Dubey saving grace film would imply film grace, let's be. I don't know performances dialogues frustrating. The general concept 'comedy' 'entertainment' lame, making difficult believe, low standard humor is. And despite rock-bottom expectations. Shouldn't slapping, mechanism make people laugh, fashion 50s? Scampering, fast-forward funny Charlie Chaplin first times. And pun stops smart use words age 10. Even silliest silly comedies leave-your-brains-behind genre gone beyond done-to-death tools making audience laugh. Oh yeah, first cousins, toilet sexual humor. Needless say, David Dhawan's Chashme Baddoor lowest possible form gags categories. Having likes Anupam Kher Rishi Kapoor mouth makes want cry. More try spoof Sholay's mausiji sequence enact SMS forward take Chak De! India's 'sattar minute'. For sake completeness, I mention original Chashme Buddoor. Chashme Baddoor chooses completely ignore good Chashme Buddoor - simplicity satire. Instead, goes make bad, worse. For example, climax made even implausible. Amidst then, interesting attempt different way songs shot. They loud far melodious, expected. But smart editing camerawork makes stand otherwise thoughtless execution. Other though, isn't much could do. After all, Chashme Buddoor music pre-70s pay tribute to, whereas yesteryears current films 90s. It difficult decide urge cry silly lines part audience enjoying whole-heartedly. Some silliness bad makes laugh, Chashme Baddoor's brand stupidity doesn't even fall category. "What else expect?" Is question I answer to. What I thinking drifting away films abysmal comedy though, - last week's Himmatwala fell pretty much flat face. What David Dhawans Sajid Khans world years audience starts wholeheartedly rejecting brainless entertainment?
