I want conduct poll. Did think name Detective Nani promos imply film made kids? Yes +1. That's mine. Well, I saw I thought heavily misled. The film hardly kids. If all, could kids 12 sensitize conditions unfortunate children live in. I won't get specific film tries sort-of secretive intentions well past half-way. Rest assured kids going tons uncomfortable questions. But, also rest assured questions going dreaded three-letter word. Add wanna-be cute songs so-humorless hour between. Certainly kid-pleaser. The annoying thing even made intention entertain enlighten adults. Adults know peddlers society. We've heard enough stories supposedly well-meaning outfits involved. There's insight discovery undiscovered here. And it's done lackluster manner too. And yet story complicated enough hold interest one really keen to. It's complete write-off. But there's detailed characterization here. For example, don't even get glimpse motivations villains. They evil. Enough said. None actors half-decent job acting either. It's full perfunctory "oh, I'm camera" performances. Almost two half hours amateur acting get pretty tedious. There one-odd line that's funny evokes smile, thus far please anyone. I actually hoping something I could take kids hot summer afternoon, day vacation well-spent. But, no. It's neither sweet enough kids, mean enough adults.
