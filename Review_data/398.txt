Sadrakshanay Khalnigrahanay. Roughly translated ‘Protecting good, destroying evil’. Cynics though may be, perhaps could grant motto Maharashtra Police simple elegant. (So official website translates “Protecting The Rightous [sic] And Controlling & Annihilating The Evil” (sic)?) Today, eve third anniversary 26/11, comes tribute brave yet controversial men often lay lives line, me. Noted Marathi filmmaker Gajendra Ahire’s latest offering, Hello Jai Hind, take travails angst honest policeman. No, ‘ACP’ ‘Inspector’, constable. That man lowest rung hierarchical ladder police force. In cinema, generally ignored, often parodied stereotyped, never truly done justice to. Not film pretends realistic documentary, far it. Where succeeds takes dramatic story treats manner honest cinephiles subjected lately. Yes, flaws. Yes, film prone over-the-top theatrics moments subtlety would perhaps worked better. Yes, screenplay could tighter, impactful climax. But times audience’s idea good cop film Singham, Hello Jai Hind refreshing film. Celebrated art director Nitin Chandrakant Desai makes acting debut Shivaji Pawar, honest man chose policeman, ever wanted be. While quite clear Desai actor clearly lacks ability pull complex role, one also quite clearly see chosen play protagonist - looks part. He looks like could constable Mumbai police. The gait, posture, hair, physique, everything says ‘Constable Pawar’. Performance-wise actress (and producer) Trupti Bhoir, Shivaji Pawar’s wife, steals show. She competent, also looks part, presence always makes interested character’s next move be. The story much his. It tough Mumbai policeman’s wife, especially constable’s, dangers high returns low. Trupti manages make us feel turmoil. They say, ‘God details’. That Gajendra Ahire’s big victory film. The wife tells husband, passing, instead new sari, would rather save fridge. A scenes later, months passed lives, long two-shot, unobtrusively parked along wall stands small fridge. No attention drawn whatsoever – sign mature filmmaking. What Nitin Desai lacks acting department, makes best – art direction. The entire film set Mumbai, film captures that. The houses, streets, rain, everything seems real. Not get feeling location constructed, even though film shot sets. (The way I got know I stayed end credits, lists three locations - N. D. Studio, Film City Gateway India.) Also, sound design foley work commendable - gently ensure sounds capture flavor Mumbai. A special mention must go maestro Illaiyaraaja, given music film. Few men come melodies go moment occasion like great man, music asset film. Be ‘Ganpati Ala’ track songs sung Sukhwinder, Kailash Kher Hariharan respectively, music soul - kind would find way iPods across nation, kind one would fast-forward watching DVD. One wishes Illaiyaraaja films, even regional offbeat. The film’s major flaw (apart Desai’s weak performance) screenplay. It tends sag, especially latter half film. Most importantly, pre-climax climax don’t justice buildup. A stronger third act would truly done wonders film. Still, treatment, backdrop real events crisp under-two-hour-runtime make film engaging part. Ultimately, film worked even though far perfect, Hello Jai Hind honest emphatically shows us Singham NOT Kingam.
