Michael Shannon clearly complex actor. Staid, stoic exactly widest range expressions offer, last seen superhero’s archenemy recent summer blockbuster. Even there, ice-cool, steely demeanour added air menace him, never mind character moral ambiguity it, made hard hate fear outright. In fact, Ariel Vromen’s The Iceman, film premiered internationally last year, probably found release opportune time worldwide visibility Michael Shannon received courtesy Man Steel. A dark, brooding character study contract killer manages keep part identity secret even immediate family, film’s measured pace, sombre atmosphere Michael Shannon’s turn real life Richard Kuklinski, film based, hold film together, despite rather erratic writing slight unwieldiness directorial craft. Of course, really intrigues Richard Kuklinski himself. It hard imagine man easily takes contract killing profession, doesn’t seem moral compass guides regard rights wrongs actions. He absolutely unflappable face crisis (as long doesn’t involve family), doesn’t hesitate taking human life even isn’t part contract. And yet, Richard Kuklinski living, breathing person; man took hundreds lives seemed show remorse whatsoever. In sense, The Iceman offers real graph. Despite fact film gets noir feel nearly right, offers real plot, sense anticipation terms twist two. A straight, bleak, stark narrative always feel like documentation facts, opposed real story emotional core one hang to. The times one identify Richard Kuklinski real human displays love family, even done sense cold detachment. However, director Arial Vromen seems sorts trying make juxtaposition cold-blooded killer family man. This, precisely this, Michael Shannon’s performance saves film. The Iceman epithet given Kuklinski himself, well apply Shannon too. His physical appearance changes film, iciness remains same. The expressions minimal, emotions manages convey even without changing expression testament unique actor - much man literally part mood film creates. One almost gets feeling taking frame would brighten things bit. Ray Liotta plays Roy DeMeo, mob boss recruits Kuklinski kickstarts killing career. Liotta terrific form again, maliciously towering every character film, even Kuklinski, share frame. Chris Evans, completely different avatar grungy yet affable killer himself, excellent tiny role. The weak link film terms choice actor well performance Winona Ryder, plays Kuklinski’s wife. Apart fact doesn’t age one bit film, performance comes across false one time many. Despite interesting one-line premise The Iceman offers, film doesn’t particularly ‘entertain’ you, that’s you’re looking for. What rather well though, manage engage creating dark little world, provided willing submit it. The Iceman isn’t everyone; mostly don’t mind feeling little cold deep, deep within.
