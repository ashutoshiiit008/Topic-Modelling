War films - whether countries gangs - invariably end touching futility war. War - Chhod Na Yaar wears badge honor. Even though, route different use satire comedy, theme rubbed way hard. True, solution something like India-Pakistan war simple 'stop fighting'. If only, simple though, right? Given War Chhod Na Yaar satire doesn't claim take anything seriously, might tad unfair hold simple solutions it. Even so, film misses basic coherence. Behind satirical coat, War Chhod Na Yaar get away implausibility plot. But then, characters, situations, dialogue supposed make laugh least smirk, right? For example, initial setup imminent war border, protagonists stationed, doesn't move beyond film well second half. To keep situations comic typical potshots Pakistanis. I would like think even find funny, jokes would get old within five minutes film. Other toilet humor inane one-liners. And generic references facebook chat cool movie make. Maybe, odd line could make laugh; waiting something happen. Sharman Joshi, Javed Jaffrey, Sanjai Mishra bring energy film. However again, characters get repetitive thus predictable pretty soon. Soha Ali Khan required feel shy, flirt eyes look determined every while. She right. Then regular dose songs business film. I guess thankful aren't choreographed and/or item numbers. I films speak power common man. But, War Chhodo Na Yaar dissuading empowering. It highly unlikely makers didn't want inspire audience make feel like play role. In case, think attempt failed. Not mention entire section population totally ignored. The section believe war fought. Maybe, would another film. Hopefully not.
