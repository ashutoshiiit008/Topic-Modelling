Jason Statham’s name appears screen immediately know expect film. Former star films like Lock, Stock Two smoking Barrels, Snatch Transporter series, Statham stayed true action genre – never really deviating comfort zone. Safe however, action overdose. It’s case dumbing basic story, many unnecessary stylistic elements, large celebration Statham nothing more. In Safe, Statham plays ex-cop Luke Wright worked NYPD exclusively mayor (Chris Sarandon). Fed rising corruption, decides quit get involved city’s underground rigged fights culture. You shown gives vent frustration, visuals repeated action, minute minute. The conflict arises Russian Mafia gets involved kills entire family dispute. He decides seek revenge witnesses men torturing 11-year old Chinese girl, Mei. The film much growing relationship, Statham plays protector. However, Safe doesn’t hold long enough establish emotional connection. We told nothing Statham’s wife, film motive empathize conversation. The action, result, isn’t soaked cold-blooded revenge either, therefore makes stale viewing. Mei’s character written well, fortunately also graph. We learn apart helpless situation, also whiz kid learns faster speaks. The pace film becomes problem; mostly director Boaz Yakin decided depend fast cuts establish film. You aren’t given enough time grasp anything – know it, someone beating another person. The first minutes Safe seemed interesting. The visual texture film gritty I expecting nail-bitter. Statham takes time overpower every aspect film (he also looks uncannily like Bruce Willis, bar pretty high) left, wanting see parts film. A back-story Statham’s relationship wife maybe terror hold Russian Mafia New York crime underbelly could lot insightful us base film upon. The number could-haves brings viewing experience Safe. Watch you’re die-hard fan Jason Statham.
