Kevin Flynn created video game 20 years ago. His son Sam, finds cyber universe father created become much video game. Tron: Legacy superb action special effects amazing too. I especially loved design bikes cars, interior buildings. Although entire movie isn’t 3D, sequences Grid, lasted moments, spectacular take cake. The storyline quite interesting don't know anything earlier Tron (1982). After watching earlier version, concepts clearer I could connect dialogues better. So, haven’t seen Tron(1982) yet, I suggest homework watch Tron Legacy. It amazing young Jeff Bridges (Clu) Bruce Boxleitner (Tron) look! Bridges fantastic film. He dominates, screen time given him, powerful performance brought in. Garrett Hedlund starts well, performance overshadowed characters, movie proceeds. Olivia Wilde puts decent performance Quorra, looks great. Michael Sheen (David Frost Frost/Nixon) small admirable job cunning character, something pull off. The basic story mediocre. It quite uncomplicated makes dislike writers. The focus clearly special effects, less makes faults. The disappointment, big that, non-action parts. The characters sit around talk, made impatient, almost bored. Also, couple sequences ridiculous, way something like could logically happen even gaming world. Dramatizing go little top, dismissed end necessary evil. The film runs consistently different look throughout, gaming world look peculaiar? Lack colour deserves huge thumbs up, really makes film look like shot different world. It's funny much gaming world made human world aspects, example emotions. Programs shouldn't understand anything logic, right? But course, I making analogy Star Trek – bad. Costumes amazing, light! Camerawork decent. Sound track good, even better sound light harmony. And thank God cyber romance. No, like Matrix, don’t think much. Enjoy action cyber universe, rich music entertaining. Watch sure, 3D possible.
