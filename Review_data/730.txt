Provoked certainly brings attention plight women hands psychotic male chauvinists. So, want get average movie-goer watch sad story lady physically, emotionally sexually abused husband? Get Aishwarya Rai (Kiranjit Ahluwalia) lady! And delivers performance is, without doubt, best far. Naah, means flawless performance. Every Aishwarya inadvertently slip ‘oh, I sorry, I gorgeous supermodel made look like battered housewife’ mode. But positives easily outweigh negatives time around. And one woman needs make-up look stunning! Performance-wise transformation unsure, easily-dominated wife confident, inspirational woman wonderful. Especially note slouch turn confident straight back. The nuances complex character captured well – frustration, anger, hatred, guilt, glimpses happiness. What work movie though, gaps story. Though memory-triggered flashbacks nice way narrate story, ultimately failed make impact. They tried dialogues needed done story visuals. Also shortcomings lot pace, time allotted part story. While first half took sweet time establishing background, second half left cover lot ground (including abrupt digressions side characters’ stories). The biggest hole torture Kiranjit subjected to. All movie expecting something gruesome happen shake inside. But doesn’t happen. And leave theater moved yet unconvinced - uncertain made plain village girl take drastic step. Maybe want shoo away audience gory details. But then, idea keep audience interested, desperately needed better dialogues. Especially, lines given beautiful Nandita Das lousy. Again, inevitable tussle dramatize-for-effect stick-to-reality. Tricky one, indeed. The thing Aishwarya’s moving performance makes worth watch subject itself. This subject needs attention certainly one woman’s story. But make anyone stand cause?
