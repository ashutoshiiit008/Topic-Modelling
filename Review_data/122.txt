Sure, Band Baaja Baaraat old story. The lead lady woman essence, takes world face can't miss gaping need man life. The male lead yet another confused young man, symbol talented directionless youth. For newbies working together business, hardly go struggle. Everything laid easily. YET warm them. You feel shimmer happiness together. You want tell silly fighting other. I detested Band Baaja Baaraat's overall escape over-simplicity I loved slight details every-day relationship. "falling love" beneath her, that's regular girls do, Shruti (Anushka Sharma). And yet, savors special moments spent friend. She modern simple-minded. And yet, doesn't come across contradictory. Bittoo (Ranveer Singh) hasn't thought much aspirations. All knows doesn't want join family business. Whatever keeps away becomes aspiration. Her rule life becomes rule, without rhyme reason. Because that's is. And things pretty much stay way. She remains adamant foolhardy. He doesn't budge foolish self. Their misunderstanding bickering commonplace real life. Which why, actions reactions standard boy meets girl story, don't seem place. The simple-headedness mars film too. The agonizing conflict film doesn't hit hard enough heavy "business" set-up. Business mixes pleasure. The set-up Shruti's business, conflict arises elsewhere. Yet, interested what's going witty dialogues delivered attitude characters meant portray. Neither Anushka Ranveer "screen presence". They could look best deliver endearing lines, I could well enjoying without looking observing props background. And works favor. Band Baaja Baaraat leaves warm feeling without overt stylization grand charisma. In fact, Ranveer's pictures promo posters make look like roadside romeo, girl would avoid looking at. And that's film. Either perfect casting brilliant performance ofcourse intelligent blend two, next films tell. Though Anushka couple movie old, first one "star"-backup. A couple roles role substance like one I think we'll something look forward every time picks script. You hear movie titled Band Baaja Baaraat produced best marriage scene creators market, Yash Raj Films apprehension builds cringe. You go theater expecting garish set-up over-zealous background score. The first scenes texture different expectations choice sit-up notice. It's gloss, ruggedness street. The street soon decorated earthy, believable fashion. Are seeing Yash Raj turn leaf hunky-dory, big, fat wedding environment? There glimpse. If anything else, new venture's awesome logo film. (I tried look couldnâ€™t find it. It plays Band Baaja Baaraat starts. I'll update space I locate leave link find it. Thanks!)
