Tom Hooper’s grandiose vision brings Victor Hugo’s epic novel long-running stage production based cinematic life; film, however, virtually owned performance Hugh Jackman. Beautifully shot, complex narrative expertly edited embellished truly outstanding performances, Les Misérables isn’t easiest films watch, particularly Indian audiences – little later. Still, film enough meat really keen enjoy, indulgent grandeur thing. Set across nearly two decades early 19th century France, film epic tale love, duty, honour freedom; men lock horns battles principle last lifetime. Jean Valjean thief serving time stealing loaf bread. 19 years sentence, released parole. An encounter Bishop sparks something causes break parole disappear. Why I believe Indian audiences find Les Misérables hard film digest almost spoken dialogue – characters converse singing lines almost throughout film. A tough, applause-worthy task actors doubt, something audience exposed enough to, appreciate fully. Add fact film undeniably indulgent side – takes time unfold, characters sing long portions themselves, editing frenetic, keep pace musical narrative. But reward found endure gargantuan indulgence display. The production design, costumes make-up absolutely top-notch; streets 19th century Paris come alive every frame, works photographic art. To add that, I spent every five minutes marveling editing manner entire film put together. Some performances, then, icing rather large cake. Hugh Jackman’s performance is, far, striking thing Les Misérables; even production design, opinion. His eyes body language embody complex character Jean Valjean, whose journey film essentially traces. It doesn’t hurt also sings beautifully. It took get used Russell Crowe singing lines Inspector Javert, I did, character well performance grew me. Anne Hathaway Spandex image I unable shake head prior watching film, performance Fantine helped immensely regard; role small, performance spellbinding. Amanda Seyfried looks gorgeous, Sacha Baron Cohen Helena Bonham Carter goofy, provide much-needed comic relief. Les Misérables, I mentioned earlier, film everyone. It works better people appreciate individual bits filmmaking magic, people want get sucked whole experience film totality. I’d still recommend it, isn’t often films like see theatrical release India. Besides, performances technical magnificence alone, film worth experiencing.
