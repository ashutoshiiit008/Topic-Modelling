Recall movie you've thoroughly enjoyed. Remember feeling excited gleeful anticipation next line enjoying every bit whatever unfolding front you. That would close I experienced first 20-25 minutes Chaalis Chauraasi. And I tried fight boredom coming flat narrative I lost battle. There still foursome Naseeruddin Shah, Kay Kay Menon, Atul Kulkarni Ravi Kishanwho try keep energy chemistry generated earlier on. But effort manifold make deteriorating pace narrative. The downfall starts flashbacks characters. In hind sight, backstories hindrance flow, also unnecessary. Nothing made histories rest film justify screen time eat up. Same goes item numbers. Though cute lyrics it's fun watch Naseeruddin Shah use dancing skills item song, variety wears second song. It’s shame director, Hriday Shetty could better things resort regular "commercial" modes. At most, one song accepted part script, others forced. I know, I could copy-paste earlier paragraph almost every review I write (which I usually avoid mention songs, unless extremely good bad.) But I choose elaborate film could hit bull's eye intrusions. It cast, slightly off-center style direction, off-beat story going it. A potentially quick, zany, crisp film given way plot lost way home run. It’s shame films good story line start finish. And Chaalis Chauraasi one them. The problem chose fill with. The comedy errors loses charm almost dialogue writers lost inspiration director felt over-inspired elongate every scene little necessary keep audience interested. Yet, I'd look forward Hriday Shetty's next film. It feels like Chaalis Chauraasi attempt finding footing. Here's hoping has.
