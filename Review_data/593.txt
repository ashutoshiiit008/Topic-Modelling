You know you’re treat see title credits roll Bimal Roy’s Madhumati. There’s Roy, director; Ritwik Ghatak, story writer; Hrishikesh Mukherjee, editor; Salil Chowdhury, music director. On paper, one lethal combination Bengali biggies solitary film. The film perhaps first Indian film deal theme re-incarnation romantic setting. I’m surprised. It’s Hinduvian love story - timeless love all, meant last seven births, solemnized marriage. After 50 years film classic despite many films exploring theme (Karz, Karan Arjun, Hamesha, Om Shanti Om), story still seems convincing, fair amount leap faith. I truly believe well-made films difficult spoof, I’d consider Madhumati one amongst them. If you’re post 1970s generation I am, film’s progress makes go particular cycle emotions. It begins admiration - extremely handsome Anand (Dilip Kumar), whose mannerisms charm complimented beautiful hillside locales Madhumati set. You proceed respect - detailed characterisation, leading starcast, also supporting cast. There’s Anand whose skills painter well-intentioned, later coming handy woo lover, also climax film. Ugranarayan (Pran), owner timber estate Anand employed appears born despised. And there’s beautiful village belle Madhumati (Vyjayanthimala) whose beauty almost one scenic hills. (In addition scriptwriters, I’d give much credit Lata Mangeshkar Madhumati’s characterisation. 'Aaja re...pardesi' ultimate paean beckoning lover.) Ghatak’s setting film seems right, description village, people history, enough intrigue let know that, hills may appear beautiful outside, all’s well probe deeper. It’s exactly friction one needs love story unfold that’s Ugranarayan plays villian. Your respect film, followed awe - towards Ghatak Roy - pulling first film re-incarnation, history Indian cinema. Although mythology religion deeply rooted Indian culture, must challenging film-makers produce commercial scale. It however, biggest commercial success Roy’s films - films deep social fibre running e.g Do Bigha Zameen (highly socialistic), Parakh (satire, democracy), Sujata (untouchability) Parineeta, Devdas (class divide). Thankfully, time film ends, you’re sure despite Red Chillies making Om Shanti Om it, Madhumati soul it. “They beat up, torture body, cannot touch soul,” seems true. I cannot explain enough important role film’s music plays film. This Salil Chowdhury’s best work. 'Suhaana safar aur yeh mausam haseen' (Mukesh), 'Zulmi sang ankh ladi' (Lata Mangeshkar), 'Chadh gayo papi bichua' (Lata Mangeshkar, Manna Dey), 'Jungle mein mor naacha' (Mukhesh) 'Aaja re pardesi' (Lata Mangeshkar) timeless classics, play invaluable role heightening film’s commercial aesthetic sensibilities. 'Aaja re pardesi' example, haunting sound creaking doors, hooting owls repetitive shots full moon going clouds - become clichés films element spook them. Madhumati deftly combines concept timeless romance, re-incarnation, class discrimination feudalism producing something stays long film over. It film proudly sits fence romance, tragedy ghost story, feat rarely achieved. I watched film newly launched Poster Series Shemaroo. It’s fabulous concept, get replica original film poster, free along DVD pack digitally mastered version original film. I wish would DVDs like these.
