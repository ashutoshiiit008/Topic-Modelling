The expectations high; arguably two greatest actors business sharing screen space decade. (The last time Michael Mann’s crime thriller Heat) Robert De Niro Al Pacino sixties legends, immortal beings defined contours acting. They substantial body work credit boot superstars. So one right expect film average good. Unfortunately, film disappoints counts. The screenplay tries far clever, extremely weak rationale conflict loss faith heart plot. The writer throws decoy here, red herring there, weak, tries make jell together end. All decoys make plot seemingly far complicated is, distracts viewer. One starts suspect main plot point 20 minutes movie. The director takes badly written material goes fast editing hand held close-ups create edgy feel story characters. Things seem move fast pace; I suspect done avoid feel police procedural thriller. He also chooses dark predominantly monochromatic colour palette throws grainy, news video type sequences, gritty feel. He two great actors work with, unfortunately memorable lines, neither standout scenes. Both De Niro Al Pacino competent; could done parts taking laundry. We times De Niro relapsing trademark “braggart” style declaiming sundry, part work low key. Pacino go jumpy, edgy mode remains low key too. The final denouement terribly listless lacks energy. De Niro Pacino go routine movie ends. By time anyways desperately want end. A terrible, terrible disappointment movie is; one really wished director writer reviewed brief made film. Seriously, one terrible waste.
