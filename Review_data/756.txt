You inkling director's self-indulgence soon heard title. And frame frame sitting confirming man obsessed himself, course camera. Or camera possessed him. I keen sticking promise I made months ago - control urge compare, enjoy remake. But I forced give avoiding parallels required way much focus started giving headache. Instead narrating story Ram Gopal Varma seemed solely concerned changing nitty-gritty original. You cut hands, I think story better told fingers chopped!?...You dialogue remembered 30 years later, I think silence works better...You silence here, I think long-drawn dialogues three scenes work better. Whereâ€™s creativity? Where's much talked interpretation? None characters fleshed out. All come across superficial motivations unclear. The actors plainly regurgitating utterly uninteresting dialogues. Most characters dull plain. Even Amitabh Bachchan Amitabh Bachchan Babban (his character). In fact, Heero (Ajay Devgan) Raj (Prshant Raj) almost identical characters except fall love different types girls. It's sad "style" shown use word lyrics instead oozing character. Oh wait! What I talking about!? There one strong character movie wants make sure notice personality - camera. It place, trying best steal show. This behavior getting progressively worse every RGV product. And even simplest scenes. So, imagine treat gave action sequences. I hope choreographer wasn't paid much, camera dancing. Amit Roy (cinematographer) must tired person. He seriously needs break - long one. And might well take Amar Mohile him, must worn cranking volume background score too. It also looks like huge date problems cast. There hardly scenes two people frame together (way many shoulder shots close-ups). This gives little room chemistry, any, characters reach audience. Okay, I go cameraman director...let's call quits (Huge hint Ramu & factory workers!) Sholay? Nope, NOT Sholay. Sholay detailed characters played unforgettable actors, dialogues die for, brilliant sense humor, good music, kick-ass background score, etc, etc, etc. Just shifting location Ramgadh Mumbai festivals "Holi" "Diwali" full-of-life cameraman ain't going help one.
