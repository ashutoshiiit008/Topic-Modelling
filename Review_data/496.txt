Kahaani film I'd urge watch. You want watch story, want watch character BVidya, want watch actor Vidya. Yes, means I want drop reading review begin booking tickets next window. Not Kahaani 'must watch', I fear I might spill beans. Any word I say (or say) might give film away I'd feel extreme regret I instrumental giving anything away makers beautifully guarded. Thus far. But Vidya Balan something CAN talk about. The lady makes difficult pick favorite amongst films. She adds list. Her character's vulnerability indistinguishable whatever actor might felt. So stressed pregnant Vidya looking husband, want relax saying, "orre orre, shaant-shaant, nai baby ho jobe" ("relax else might deliver" whatever broken Bangla I know). And first ten minutes film. Your emotions towards get sensitive film progresses. For thriller solely rests shoulders woman character, Kahaani brilliant job exposing little amount material move story forward keep interested. It teases you, seasoned thriller viewer, along way too. But mostly hook sometimes crook, keeps wanting crack puzzle. The smart writing took viewer roller coaster ride one moment. A moment, twist I felt cheated. You know, engage thriller want feel smart deciphering mystery material given you. And writers pull something thin air left sulking feeling deceived. Kahaani one moment, soon enough recovers. It gives enough justification don't feel like big fool all. Sorry, saying anything would unfair makers. In fact, merely naming genre film giving away little makers intended to, trailers anything go by. Interestingly then, editing background music stay true edgy theme, pace story never gets quick disconcert. Similarly, rugged, sordid texture film isn't something you'd associate thriller. Even interestingly, mismatch either noticeable first watch doesn't seem distract. You end enjoying Clinton Cerejo's background score pick R. D. Burman's popular songs yesteryears, Bangla. In equal measure, notice quirky editing especially first 10 minutes - they'll put rest doubts might genre. Speaking genres, Kahaani produces one moment romance entire 2-hour films dedicated genre aren't able create times. Same goes couple times makes laugh too. The rare humor blends well given serious topic hand. Kahaani also couple insightful moments comments passed prevalent system wonder truthfulness, righteousness, politically correctness debate open subject to. It might sound like Kahaani tragedy, comedy, drama, romance. And does. Not mention one times (first?), mainstream Hindi film's camera romanced Calcutta. But, it's gentle fluid. You looking throughout two hours yet don't realize it.
