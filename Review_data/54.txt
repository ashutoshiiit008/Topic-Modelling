Aatma leaves many questions. Why horror films same? Why oh-so-lame? Why involve artist who's child? Are horrified adults mild? These rhetorics, genuine questions. Aatma starts out, right trailers, premise dead dad wanting child. Aatma stays pretty much right till end. There little terms movement baseline. Sure, doctors, priests murders, pretty much predictable. And what's horror film going horrify with, know what's going happen next. Without support, audience less rely performances feel characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui invoke disgust anger even he's shown screen. However, taking nothing away acting effort, negative emotions directly correlated characterisation. Again, invoked, stays put. You cannot ignore fact decent chance revealing intentions gradually, thus building drama high. But well, let cat promos itself. Bipasha Basu drill scared, concerned mother. But, much screenplay sleep away child seems fatal danger. At risk revealing little detail, said scene Bipasha Basu's Maya sleep mom comforted daughter-in-danger sleeping another room! And concern child artists? Should human put ordeal acting roles require possessed murder people brutally (Doyel Dhawan) - age 6! And specific film, even Hindi films, child put first giving performances watching screen. What kind messed race we, need use tenderness age entertain us? (I hope said artists aren't allowed watch films age. But, I know highly unlikely.) And sad part is, doesn't even spook us. We've seen many times immune possessed children. Oh well. I nit-picking I point "Whhaat?" moment, I see school teacher sitting desk, teaching - one-leg-over-another short skirt! Yeah, petty me. If I pick one positive entire film, would attempt mood. The gloomy blues create right atmosphere, even pretty dark day time. However, background music elements bring film average. So, courtesy tip towards science God later, film miseries end. Aatma short, even certainly sweet, thank writers small mercies.
