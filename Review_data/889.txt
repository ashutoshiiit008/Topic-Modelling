I thought film marketed rugged look would action flick. But, surprise-surprise Tashan out-and-out comedy. The action makes laugh, romance makes laugh louder, funny characters make laugh even seething anger. And beauty I haven't able figure whether intentional! Speaking beauty, long time I seen India shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) saturated color, alright. Nevertheless way intrinsic beauty places shot made want find exactly places I could go there. But alas! Come action sequences, camera blows horn hard. It doesn't allow audience register seemingly interesting stunts. Similarly, glimpses interesting editing decisions. Like character says 'BITCH' long 'i' scene cuts long shot beach "kabhi kabhi" playing car falls cliff song reaches "tujhe zameen par bulaya gaya" (you called earth) part. That car flying air shoddily animated different story altogether. However, really surprised four main characters film actually different traits more-or-less consistently adhered to. What's more, one story arc too!? - Very atypical Hindi movie genre. An underworld don, wannabe super-powers, supposed simpleton, lady mission - brain brawn. (yes girl too! YAY!!) Sounds like decent enough premise. But something grossly went wrong execution. And I could complain artistic liberties taken, art sight. A big fat finger pointed dialogues. My fears came true, word "the" overused. I think writer pretty sure people going go sleep. Which name movie repeated every half hour - orient people woken up! Also, Hindi-fying English done abundance I soon immune it. So, didn't bother me, didn't make laugh either. Sure, obvious tributes Deewar, Sholay, Jaane Bhi Yaaro. Would good done well, though. What amazing despite really lousy dialogues, one four actors given good performance. Having right expressions (exaggerated might be) rise bad lines must applauded case. Certainly, roles must looked interesting script stage established actors like give Tashan space portfolio. Of course, Kareena overshadowed male trio put together "looks" department. By way, I one sense Akshay Kumar Saif Ali Khan old mature industry flout 'sexiness' inelegant, uncouth way? The songs functioned like snooze button me. I felt like muting song started suffered familiar rude shock five minutes later ended giving charge louder background music. So loud overshadowed dialogue many points. The lyrics, choreography course music, seemed generic random. Actually level generic. We see Kareena sporting golden "Aishwarya look" Dhoom 2 also Aishwarya's dance moves! And Saif Ali Khan made look like couldn't dance save life? Despite things done right, leaving theater I praying Vijay Acharya hadn't over-dosed whatever anesthetic using. The numbness I felt brain region really scary. Anyway, all's good, I'm hoping keep away
