This story tries address complexities relationship(s), that’s remains…a trial…it succeeds absolutely nothing! The movie starts almost characters nice normal people, become obsessed lovers. At one point start feeling bad almost characters end sympathizing none. Someone ought teach Urmila Matondkar art moving facial muscles. (Maybe, maybe, could see facial muscles make-up person didn’t his/her job over-zealously.) Come lady, one groans moans time, glycerin-moistened-eyes don’t convince us sad widen eyes double size can’t made believe scared/surprised. Just imagine, acting pretentious! I wasn’t sure whether Urmila enjoying touched Sanjay Suri dreading it. Granted, story line asked both, sad part can’t make one when. It sad Juhi Chawla, Sanjay Suri, Jimmy Sheirgill put together couldn’t make lot bad performances surrounding them, looking fabulous though. Sanjay Jimmy tried make badly drawn characters, pumping much iron for? Some really good talent wasted time script goes hay-wire. Other characters better sketched murdered awesome bad acting. A things handled better compared rest movie. The scenes showing Sanjay Suri’s imagination running wild played well. But script grim either dying person someone cares dying character cracking jokes moments death. The light moments make laugh sad funny. The mundane dialogues songs don’t help either. Now I confused – bad dialogues poor dialogue delivery, lousy direction mediocre story-line…hmmmm…
