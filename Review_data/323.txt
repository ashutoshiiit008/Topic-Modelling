It always heartening watch start indie film. The excitement roars inside begin liking film matched experiences. Filmistaan gives exactly experience. Unfortunately, doesn't hold well till end. The dialogue, performances setting hook beginning. I don't remember last time I many "laugh loud"s watching film. Sharib Hashmi Indian assistant director, mistakenly kidnapped terrorists (Kumud Mishra Gopal Dutt) imprisoned localite's, (Inaamulhaq) house, absolutely endearing. It isn't difficult believe well-liked character even Indian Pakistani village. Of course, many points dialogue department Sharib Hashmi, charms spoofy wannabe actor do. So much that, even though Inaamulhaq gives equally good performance, unfortunately pales alongside Sharib Hashmi. In comparison, Kumud Mishra Gopal Dutt don't deep enough character even try coming close. But, desert becomes character look forward long shots. Almost aridity dustiness seep theater inviting film. On hand, music slightly jarring. Not songs bad, didn't belong film's genre. The real problem comes second half isn't explicitly downhill either. It's becomes little predictable characters taking clichéd routes. Four characters, four clichés. And many predictable turn events situations. The fun yet satirical moments gradually deteriorate "oh left obvious point." And drops Filmistaan 'do miss' 'watch can'. And that's saddening beginning heartening, hurts like film like Filmistaan.
