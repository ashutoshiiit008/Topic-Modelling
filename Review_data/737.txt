You could call Queen chick-flick, could call coming-of-age film. You could even say apt one release "Women's Day" weekend. Bracket like it, cannot enough films made like Queen. And I don't say Queen sees protagonist empower small-town woman put around woman willing find herself. Neither human comes despite dumps, without losing innocence. Films like Queen made way story narrated. You relate protagonist word go - comes person hates use voice-over introduce film. You Queen, part thoughts. You jump thought thought. And best bit - voice-over stops there. It isn't overdone. Kangna Ranaut's Rani Queen innocent simplicity engages instantly. Her character builds grows ever-so-slowly, yet, far getting bored. In fact, one rare films I didn't want end. Rani Kangna weave together seamlessly, cannot tell falling love actor character. And (both Rani Kangna) could carried film alone fragile shoulders, lent great support supporting cast characters play. Films like Queen also show things beyond character situations overall plot. It's details traps keep falling into. Tiny things make Queen, film, even charming - like doesn't let go handbag - no, street thug see trailer - club, dancing. Also, easy let Queen get makeover transform confident, outgoing girl, especially given Kangna Ranaut's glamour quotient. But, don't take bait. The character transforms within believable boundary. This aspect refreshing compare almost every hindi film characters transform exact opposite slightest instigation. Given things right Queen, discussion would still incomplete without word music. Wow. Both, writing performances movies like Highway Queen swoon surprise. It takes long get lovely feeling swept feet, especially least expected. Good thing I rush come back ground.
