You expecting intelligent cinema walk Sajid Khan film. That no-brainer. To honest, I pleasantly surprised I saw semblance story first hour. It made way much sense (even slapsticky kind way) film made person made Housefull 2. It insensitive multiple levels, yet borderline "not bad I thought". And course, goes one bad sub-plot another till sick tired all. Why Saif Ali Khan one? Is money good? Or matter Bipasha Basu. Her role tiny time she's screen relegated second lead lady. Ram Kapoor best lot, that's barely compliment. Sure, Saif Ali Khan Riteish Deshmukh try contort faces ways made theater laugh, seemed like child's play. Anyway, change genre Riteish Deshmukh long overdue, I'll hold comment till Ek Villain. In one though usual stuff. When lines unengaging much do. Interestingly, you'd thought film would rely heavily one-liners punch lines get laugh audiences. But instead, "comedy" came situations rather dialogue there. I must confess here, judgment way viewers reacting rather response. My gut wrenched insults got heavier heavier. I'm talking assault intellect. But, insensitivity shown towards patients mental asylums; towards gay people; towards obese people; towards midgets; towards men dress like women on. What things makes us laugh? Why funny? A mental hospital warden (not even doctor!) dancing electrical wires giving electrical shock patients! Really? That's humor, that's sad. I understand, every thing needs turn outrage know laugh on. And complete circle, Sajid Khan cracks joke film too. But I comfortable poking fun people's disabilities and/or appearances. Even watching done. I guess I thankful film keeps sexual toilet humor control. Though long scenes involving one made cringe. I really expecting enjoy Sajid Khan film time soon. But, little sensitivity much ask filmmaker reasonably wide reach? Does humor someone else's expense?
