Yes, Mary Kom film much dramatized fictionalized I expected, Mary Kom character much grit even real life Mary Kom half gutsy strong-willed, makes story inspires. Unfortunately though - discount lot story. It's shame makers didn't find true story exciting enough chose spice events convenience. I understand, times commercial film needs, shouldn't done extent start questioning every episode see screen. So much that, I came home check chronology events hugely disappointed way timing climax (including opponent Mary Kom plays) changed around filmy effect. I shouldn't made wait get Google look Mary Kom's life, I want film long, long time. Then person knows nothing boxing, I wonder technicalities boxing shown appropriately. Without wanting look (more disinterest rather anything else) I willing place money boxing technicalities totally ignored. It look like ill-researched project worse, one well-done research intentionally disregarded. You narrative itself. The screenplay way episodic almost like watching film one short chapter another. Almost cover drawback, first half film even tries hand non-linear narration. Else, particular reason take us back forth timeline. It heartening though, gaps writing sidelined best efforts cast. Priyanka Chopra Darshan Kumaar equally earnest performances. At times, dialogue help others filminess distracts cannot put dialogue delivery fault. This despite distracting make-up, colored straightened hair, none belonged. The actors make root real-life people. If blatant product placement, would feel pain too. While husband's support wife's career, especially demanding one given, every one gets it. Less so, small-town rural India. I happy Mary Kom's husband, Onler's sacrifices contribution received much screen time did. This inspirational story own. And oh irony seeing sugar free, Iodex Usha advertise way film one country's athletes real-life struggled find sponsors financial support career. I guess thankful item numbers make film commercially appealing. So, would I take kids theater watch one? Unlikely, certainly make extra effort. But would want watch it's TV, see power strong will. Fortunately unfortunately, it's cinema, it's real-life person deserved film life. It also interesting biopic made person whose career still on. So know, story isn't yet chance even inspirational Mary Kom 2 hands, hopefully better film too.
