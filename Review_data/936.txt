In 1941, Sussex, England, celebrated feminist author Virginia Woolf puts rocks pockets drowns river. Of many floating speculations, largely accepted reason suicide Woolf’s much talked paranoia. Her style works widely adapted made theatrical plays feature films – yet, one film manages capture exact concoction feminism, fiction bizarre eccentricity Virginia Woolf – The Hours. The movie, based novel name Michael Cunningham, based three women connected segregated souls character Woolf’s novel Mrs. Dalloway – Clarissa Dalloway. The film also divided three time zones. In 2002, Clarissa Vaughan (played Meryl Streep), New Yorker prepares party AIDS-stricken friend Richard (Ed Harris). In 1950s Los Angeles Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) pregnant vastly dissatisfied marriage. Then Woolf (played Nichole Kidman), 1920s England, see struggling depression mental paranoia. All three characters connected – like three lost souls swimming fish bowl. They different aspects one character Woolf’s novel. Clarissa Dalloway over-analytical, submissive, bi-curious, complex woman aspects stripped three vital characters. Moore, Streep Kidman adapt cultural social time zones perfectly yet stay true complexity, The Hours complex film. It’s film delves deep psyche characters battle complicated selves. Parallel narratives guide film, get strong whiff every character’s thought processes questions. It’s technique Woolf famous – stream consciousness – ability write freely character thinks. Director Stephen Daldry adapts technique well, feel visually entering minds three women, carefully observing every thought every dilapidated query. The Hours essentially celebration complexity thought. You may going direction, plot-wise, film. You find walking around circles, dissecting every thought-bubble film tries present you. The important thing The Hours make question. The kind spooky questioning lets lie bed, stare ceiling think – What acceptable behavior not? The existential question rides backs – life about? What I mine? More that, film offers three different approaches sexuality, suicide, depression three different versions women approaches. The DVD The Hours interesting features: An audio commentary Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman 4 Featurettes: Three Women, The Mind Times Virginia Woolf, The Music The Hours, The Lives Mrs. Dalloway. All four featurrettes small explanatory. It provides great post-movie viewing puts lot things perspective haven’t read Mrs Dalloway The Hours. What makes The Hours must watch, novel, performances. Kidman absolutely engrossing, Virgina Woolf (you might even recognize nose drastically tampered with), playing desolate, complex part. I would go ahead say best performer film, even ahead Streep, looks like got sleep play part. Streepis effortless extremely likeable – concrete emotion Clarissa Dalloway doesn’t draw. Julianne Moore looks demure confused part. Watch The Hours certainly entertainment, deep difficult questioning human emotions take granted.
