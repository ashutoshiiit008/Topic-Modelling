The grainy texture, stylish camerawork finesse editing departments, make different enriching experience. Especially, see glitter glamour Hindi film world. HOWEVER, can't make-up lack detail story dialogue writing areas. And that's huge let-down. Conclusion: I felt cheated Kaminey. Yes, certainly plot points make audience think work way cause effect. And that's brilliant I love treated intelligent audience. There also underlying, witty political commentary funny insightful. But counter plot points unexplained skips jumps course explained I call Bolly-matic liberty. This also means 'twist' tale, everything goes expected - happening last decades. That's acceptable action thriller. I wasn't able give discount fact done purposefully offers appropriate tributes Apna Desh The Great Gambler. Moreover, though climax ties ends alright, forcefully. To use friend's words, "the writer gave birth character, kill it." Similarly, loads characters seem exist increase width plot, add nothing depth. I liked fact relatively small-timers crime-world. None over-powering one answerable someone powerful. The connections worked too. But, one one quirk differentiate â€“ worked didn't. But shade black. Okay, except three main characters. I understand one point film trying make people related goon industry same. Yet, finer details missing. There wasn't anything made appreciate writers' creativity. Surely, one Shahid Kapoor Priyanka Chopra's best performances. Both looking performing better day. I confess, though I found Shahid extremely attractive, taking eyes Priyanka effort whenever screen. She charming vulnerable, strong yet completely dependent lover's affection support. The cast bunch caricatures didn't make care them. Despite negatives, movie wholesome visual pleasure. We see lot handheld camerawork non-Indian films usually tend make dizzy. I find complaining camera becomes action choreographer action thrillers abroad. Similar camerawork used I felt interval cuts beat longer give orientation who's hitting who, how. The establishing shots also add ambience. A lot complaints could I don't want Vishal Bharadwaj product. While walking theater I wondered whether I'd accepting lesser director. But, I remembered first 30-45 minutes film, I trying hard like film. It wasn't working. It's since I've seen high-profile, much-looked-forward-to, Hindi movie 3 days release. Much reviews out. Though I read none them, general reaction highly positive difficult miss. Not mention, original anticipation associated film. I'm guilty able go clean slate. But, despite giving film benefit doubt high expectations, film lacked steam needed action-packed thriller. Most glaring writing department, especially dialogue character development. Those culprits kept Kaminey wholesome experience.
