I heard Amelie first time 2001 edition Academy Awards, hailed favourite win Best Foreign Language film. The trailers, rich colour, caught attention much winner category, No Man’s Land. Ashutosh Gowariker (who lobbying Lagaan) described Amelie “very cute film”. Ten years later, DVD film officially released India, I couldn’t wait get hands it. It long wait film lived expectations. This charming comedy young girl, Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) lonely childhood. She grows thanks miraculous coincidence destiny, decides become do-gooder, helping people around find happiness. In process, embarks finding happiness herself, falls love stranger who, like her, gets joy life’s simple pleasures. The film like watching artist’s dynamic alive canvas, close two hours. Few films captured Paris beautifully film - every frame stuff picture postcards made of, dripping pastry shades colours brought life meticulous digital retouching. The film achievement cinematography agile zoom-ins, top angle shots soft, delicious lighting makes every frame endearing. It also lends certain swiftness smooth flow film’s story, complimenting stylishly crafted screenplay. Paris looks like fairy-tale throughout film director Jean Pierre Jeunet plays introducing scenes re-inforce feeling (the scene funfair, example.) Tautou’s close-ups certain discipline them, depicting shy nature regularity, yet exuding certain charm, actor perfected film. Amelie also lesson drawing character outlines sub-plots. The writers manage make menial stuff look interesting, giving character distinct eccentric shades. So there’s neighbour sleeps day, bullying vegetable vendor street, book-stall owner cannot resist gossip, customer restaurant pops bubble-wrap pass time, artist bones brittle glass. And there’s young man, Nino (Mathieu Kassowitz) collects one-minute photos end discarded. The wild-goose-chase brings Amelie Nino together highlight film, kiss shared two. It one favourite first kisses screen - gentle, innocent, sweet, cute, deserving, rolled one. The absence background score moments makes kiss almost perfect. The soundtrack film lends film lot casual, whimsical feel. It’s score years begun associated French, full credit musician Yann Tiersen same. Some tracks film ringtones long time. And whenever phone rung people remarked, “Isn’t Amelie?”, I’ve smiled realised wonders Tiersen’s melodies worked audiences. The Indian edition DVD, released Shemaroo heavily censored, therefore U/A rating. Amelie’s childbirth scene, shot guesses many people world must orgasm moment, lovemaking scene toilet restaurant, censored. Naturally, scenes seem abrupt DVD. Further, absence DVD extras major downer. I would really loved see making film director’s commentary. Despite watched really good film, DVD left feeling incomplete.
