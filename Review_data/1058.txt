Rarely one see first two-three minutes screen time establish characters two lead actors well. How I wish rest movie executed skillfully too. For die-hard movie buffs first minutes make must-watch theatre. For less-inclined, good moments, glitter-dance-colour-cinematography. Certainly wait somber mood see one. All songs one second half good music beautiful poetry. No one need tell story – thanks marketing department left stone unturned publicizing Mahesh Bhatt-Parveen Babi love story. The story leaves pretty big gap makes feel cheated. It feels like first half made much devotion involvement suddenly, team wakes up…oops!!!…no time money left say all, let’s skip part here. Shiney Ahuja given laudable performance. You really feel right till end. Kangna Ranaut’s dialogue delivery needs polishing, lot it! Also, either dubbing off, trying hide lisp. The role required someone shed clothes, found someone inhibitions whatsoever, even make-up face looks patchy. Almost everything loses way half time. The reasonable dialogues followed inane ones. Really charged scenes give way drab direction. The screenplay loses slickness first half. Also, aspects schizophrenia portrayed well, others like side effects medication, patient resists medication, etc completely ignored. This one two-hours-and-a-few-minutes movies makes feel sitting seat three hours. If audience laughing loud serious scenes, know long. Am I insensitive calling supposedly sincere attempt pay tribute Parveen Babi marketing strategy? My thought leaving cinema hall – anyone deeply love, make exhibition it?
