A Muslim community bonds happily Hindu neighbourhood. Both live die other. A Hindu boy enters scene. This so-called, dashing hero bumps Muslim girl immediately falls her. He woos tirelessly (as nothing else do). They sing, dance eventually share passionate romance. And suddenly hell breaks loose. We know story. Countless amount Bollywood, romantic films (majorly 90s) followed path success similar premise. Then, Pyaar Vali Love Story – romantic story early 90s – exception overused, success-guaranteeing formula? Think SRK-standard romance dramas, Rohit Shetty-styled action flicks, mindless songs dances, over-the-top dialogues - combine end result Pyaar Vali Love Story. From producers director (who previously directed dull, widely successful Duniyadari), cast technicians, everything film looks really promising. I’ve nothing another Hindu-Muslim love story. All really matters portrayal. Apparently get serious let-down. Set backdrop 1992 Mumbai riots, Pyaar Vali Love Story recounts romance Aliya Amar, struggle stay together. Sai Tamhankar tries hard appear Muslim girl, vain. In fact, every Muslim character looks like trying hard look so, throughout film. Right beginning, speak unconvincing mishmash Hindi Marathi words. Our filmmakers continually failed convincingly depict non-Marathi characters Marathi films. This film different. It appears unreal story progresses. Just donning Muslim costumes uttering Urdu words, don’t seem Muslim. There many factors come play. This failure writers, casting directors, production designers, costume guys well make-up department. Sanjay Jadhav’s abilities questionable anybody. The man charge blamed going ahead outlandish, lacklustre script. Had plot written thoughtfully, could’ve still done wonders despite inherent predictable nature. The film’s lead actor, Swapnil Joshi biggest disappointment. I don’t understand talented actor trying Shah Rukh Khan Marathi cinema? Instead exploring acting, made busy playing chocolate hero. He getting repetitive tedious every film. Urmila Kanetkar’s Nandini bold, yet annoying. Nevertheless, far bearable otherwise mediocre film. In film, Aliya fondly calls Amar ‘stupid’. On serious note, word aptly suits story. Insanely stupid precise. This one absolutely worthy precious time money.
