And times, love doesn't happen first sight, unlike films would us believe. Or love doesn't necessarily follow intense animosity. Some times, get know person acknowledge attraction felt towards them. And times, film tries stunt works even though falls typical trappings romantic comedies every while. Given genre done death, characters moments chosen drive story forward hard work. The characters make interesting gray shades humanness time make us root them. The situations present novel way without seeming totally box. Hasee Toh Phasee succeeds counts, large extent. Meeta (Parineeti Chopra) zany character immediately likable. She overtly quirky yet given Parineeti's skills makes overlook craziness "possible". It's Parineeti Chopra outdoes given marvelous performance. Neither under-played part. She thing convinces us Meeta, Meeta. Nikhil (Siddharth Malhotra) interesting plain. You don't see characters films regular John Doe yet keep interested life goes about. In fact, simple-mindedness charms you. That glimpse craziness stifled "system". Parineeti Siddharth play well together too. From indifference neutral confused smitten - convince steps falling love. It side characters leave unconvinced. All Manoj Joshi overact make act borderline slapsticky. And therein lie traps Hasee Toh Phasee falls prey to. There clich√© situations finds in. But, point note film set middle wedding Karan Johar production yet things stay more-or-less non-masala. That director writer's victory. It refreshing watch something different attempted rundown genre rom-com. It refreshing see lead female protagonist get something real - maybe technicalities place least isn't one two extremes tomboy/chirpy-bubbly demure/shyness incarnate. It little disappointing see too, make life man. But, again, maybe love you.
