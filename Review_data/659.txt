I felt sad watching movie…really really sad. No, nothing generally predictable storyline. It also I saw many genres mixed particular end. It songs. Don’t get wrong, awesome lighting! I certainly saying I expected better Himesh Reshammiya. Its video album style picturisation either. But, Jaaved Saahab? “Aanan-Faanan”, “Rafta rafta”, “Chakna chakna”? Your poetry moved tears many time, time too, obviously wrong reasons. I grieving feels like losing Sir, inane-word-rhyming competition. Oh well, coming back story. It heavily draws , Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (the sacrificing husband), Purab Aur Paschim (the patriotism bit). Cinematically, parts shot Punjab reminded Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge. One scene particularly reminded Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahi - would give away little I like, I said one. In sense then, original ones thought combination! While scenes go contrary predictions, unreal out-of-place characterizations would make sense dream sequences. Akshay Kumar almost plays – Punjabi dude listens music ipod sporting pink silk kurta – remarkable amount restraint. He doesn’t get loud go over-the-top. The flaw actually character forgets Jatt pride head-over-heels love lady life. Katrina looks dainty share expressions. This might well best performance till date. Wait dear, compliment yet. Javed Shaikh (Parvez Khan) could use lesson two Rishi Kapoor Nina Wadia (his wife) body language dialogue delivery. The reason Upen Patel’s track exist ‘Western Union’ advertisement. I kid not, put advertisement shot Upen Patel Katrina Kaif chose cast. That would also explain Upen Patel acting like model – maintain consistency. The entertainment movie sporadic. There two sequences really work humor. These jokes could narrate; it’s way it’s done screen makes laugh heart out. That I guess makes movie comedy. There couple emotional scenes really feel sorry Arjun (Akshay Kumar). There’s romance you. Then routine foreigner belittling capabilities Indians, Indian giving back rightly so, slap across face sans violence. The good thing dialogue well delivered doesn’t get preachy Indian culture tradition. It states facts. Soon enough, digresses irrelevant facts loses grace. It’s reinforced stereotypes got tiring. The racism - white people (except one case) mean Asians don’t take breather ridiculing them. The fight cultures - second generation immigrants drink, shop party. And first generation Indian immigrants make attempt socialize natives country migrate into. In fact, desperate get daughter Indian groom, take pride Indian guy eve-teases her?!? Why painted black white inevitably black turning white (no pun intended)? Anyway, shouldn’t patriotism stimulated often times Indian actor gives mouthful side character – exists sole purpose whacked verbally anyway– movie? Shouldn’t wait least match starts bashing cricket team? Oh, look digressing now… Maybe, pure bad timing. Two movies released day deal troubles NRIs cultural disparities. Three eight days. Too much thing presented different way?
