Bol leaves huge "something missing" feeling. The kind can't point finger at. Given issue hand, expecting strong call "hard-hitting" film. You know get preachy, know might slow, know grim, prepared that. Given topic close heart "girl child" want sucked drama want brought tears. But Bol forgets engage focus creating drama. Bol's strength lies story revolves around important topic. The dire situation girl child unique Pakistan Muslims. In remote corners India, bias giving birth girl child exists leads heinous crimes. Bol creates story around issue shows us flaws society. It presents different interpretation Qoran - logical one, one actually glorifies Allah. An interpretation put shame current practices. The irony is, likelihood, film never seen people whose mindsets wants fight against. I won't surprised people don't believe watching films all. But, making point Bol becomes repetitive. And that's strange touches two separate vast issues issues like child molestation touched upon. With much talk about, shouldn't repeat itself. Along mistreatment women, comments upon transgender issues plight. But showing reality people think issues, I'm afraid certain misconceptions reinforced. For example, midwife know sexual orientation child birth? Is possible? Maybe, I don't know enough. Another factor might accentuated disconnect performances. The lead actor, Manzar Sehbai father girls hated them, nothing menacing yet wife daughters scared him. He character we'd love hate didn't even inspire emotion. In fact, lead lady, Humaima Malick, plays brave daughter, none actors made feel anything them. Even Humaima Malick's otherwise decent performance watered opening sequence spiel jail. And yet, Zainub's tale, all-important question climax enough recommend film you. It's sad depressing, longish story. The horrifying thing real-life manifold worse shown here.
