Of course, theme friends fun together hardly new "different". But gags intentionally funny, fresh presented freshness, devoid toilet humor, fairly non-adult, I'm in. Doesn't mean De Taali doesn't quips water-tight script. Hardly! Its "other" really funny situations jokes too. Also, times, humor situation driven rather situation forced accommodate lines. Another round applause writer actually made girls relevant funny comedy genre. If could sewn together coherent plot. Anyway, thing laughing loud hard-n-long neighbor gives long stare begin let go requirements "good cinema". First suspend disbelief, put brain proverbial rest couple hours, give in. Give silliness all. Give eccentric side characters comic relief sub-plots. It doesn't happen often, even couple hearty laughs make movie worth it. However completely haywire last half hour abrupt, casual ridiculous climax absolutely unforgivable. Also references particular support group bad taste don't go otherwise sensitive tone movie. Ritesh Deshmukh plays a-new-plan-a-minute Paresh Gurudev good comic timing ever. He actually looks slimmer sleeker Ayesha Takia playing loving, caring Amrita. But "chubby" side almost constantly braided hair makes character adorable, girl-next-door, "identifiable with" type. Its nice see female lead oozing sexuality us. Aftab Shivdasani pleasant surprise. He affluent Abhishek falls true love every girl meets. The man actually potential make smile! In order bring contrast Amrita Kartika's mysterious character, Rimi Sen given tanned, sexy look. She revelation too. It amazing women De Taali show need reasonably well written character. I actually liked fact entertained whole lot back-story characters. Only much revealed background necessary move plot forward. But, drawbacks. Whenever particular plot point disclosed, mind travels back relevant piece information told first, way feel manipulated. I know, sounds like I'm asking right amount information "I" want. But doesn't art lie making movie engaging thoughts come mind I'm watching it? Overall though, I enjoyed here-and-now characters. Especially considering possible alternative would voiceover reading character's resume acquaint us them. Yet, I'm sure movie could've liked many good 30 minutes shorter. And though foot-tapping numbers decent lyrics set cool choreography, still place. Any day, I would prefer fewer songs 2 hour+ movie.
