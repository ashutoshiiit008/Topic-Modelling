I'm drawing blank. There movies draw blank theyâ€™ve left spellbound. You don't know express exhilaration feel. Isn't strange draw blank movies leave numb. You left listless watching random crap clue next. Just case haven't guessed yet, Mr. Whilte Mr. Black latter. So, I am, absolutely listless numb head, don't know begin. I tried usual - mention major positives first...genuine blank...true, things beginning "not bad". Like opening action sequence, stunts special effects slick. But, badly painted yellow car shoddy overuse blue tinge extremely distracting. Then, I like way introduced characters - voiceover, title cards, plain episodes. What characters going through, defines us. But, characters interesting. I thought days characters forced story sole function playing comic relief long gone. I guess I'm mistaken. The three women stylishly kicking men around opening sequence character sketch all. They clones other. They dialogues, enter-exit-reenter-reexit randomly. They haven't even bothered giving women names. When writer hell bent upon belittling characters, story/character arc going find? And exactly often supposed leave proverbial brain behind? Now, positives, I blamed, I feel like writing one-word review, "BAD"? What I expected say Arshad Warsi, people loud feel like usher mute volume? For me, Suniel Shetty never worked simpleton. Somehow, image demeanor don't anything village-like them. So, problems start casting itself, list things complain long. Don't I need convinced determining factor behind casting particular six women, ready bare all? The music kitschy-90-ish could be, lyrics extremely generic. In fact, I think one songs almost worked lullaby me. And I don't know look, idea entertainment taking crane top-down shot swimming-trunk-clad Arshad Warsi lying weirdest hand leg movements (supposedly seductive(?))? And surrounded 50+ women wearing bikinis similar movements. And yeah, striped beach towels. Very disturbing visually, believe me. So, yeah, I think I've said enough one word would sufficed. In interest brevity saving time mine, I would say, get "to watch" list watch movies list weekend.
