Total Siyapaa reminded Hrishikesh Mukherjee films many ways. A quirkily different situation regular family; story film spans short time - case day; infused humor. Unfortunately, last bit doesn't work well Total Siyapaa. The attempt humor pretty mediocre falls flat almost along way. There couple times lines really funny get huge laugh you. But, that, wonder happening why? This could actually true film quirky characters situations. The difference though ones well made, don't wonder, let go enjoy. Total Siyapaa something sit through. In right frame mind, won't seem bad enough enduring it. But, immense potential you. The characters aren't engaging. It left situations, dialogue actors. The situation Indian girl, Asha (Yami Gautam) bringing home Pakistani boy, Aman (Ali Zafar) lots potential go either way. To either out-of-the-world hilarious go jingoistic you. Fortunately and/or unfortunately doesn't either. And middle grounds are, becomes boring. Other Anupam Kher hilarious short appearance, supporting cast more-or-less overacts. Yami Gautam doesn't much Ali Zafar hams usual. For reason, I always find Ali Zafar's dubbing off, comes way loud seems affected. As films seem funny trailers, Total Siyapaa exhausts funny lines two-minute trailer. As expected yet, sad.
