Before watching film, interesting pull factor Kashala Udyachi Baat Anupam Kher’s first ever Marathi film. Perhaps one under-utilized actors times (partly due doing), fact said dubbed film added bonus. However, Kashala Udyachi Baat, spite interesting concept core, unfulfilling effort, primarily effort get message across, film takes sermonizing. Aditya Pradhan, played Sachin Khedekar, ambitious, career-obsessed IT professional time matter life. For him, cursory duty needs fulfill journey professional success. Fed misses important event daughter’s life, wife, played Mrinal Kulkarni, packs bags leaves home daughter. Groundhog Day takes Aditya Pradhan stuck time loop – wakes every day day, Sunday – means savour finer nuances life. In comes mysterious blind stranger, acts like beacon state eternal Sunday. Directed Pramod Joshi, Kashala Udyachi Baat moments, something goes without saying. A time loop concept always interesting, always magnetic charm idea non-linearity life. However, time loop over-done, concept begin grate, much like cacophony neighbours Aditya Pradhan wake every Sunday. Adding insult injury caused draggy screenplay item number really finds place film. Sachin Khedekar talented actor, doubt. In fact, one often see chosen play part. He natural comes showing exasperation ordinary man feel life. However, one actors continuously needs reined in, over-the-top comes naturally subtle does. Mrinal Kulkarni another actor I extremely fond simply presence exudes. Though doesn’t get much film, appearance always joy. Anupam Kher fairly decent job, even Marathi, although seem little stilted. I also often got feeling wasn’t voice all, although could imagination. What good see actors like Naseeruddin Shah (in Deool) featuring Marathi films. Hopefully, provide much-needed fillip industry deserves it. Apart said item number, Kashala Udyachi Baat feels like honest effort. What happens invariably though, film veers towards preachy moralizing. Yes, life work success. But hammering audience’s head might entirely get message across. The film looks feels right, mediocre writing always sink film, matter what. The film half-decent effort, sharper, insightful screenplay would made truly worth watch. As stands though, film really something could switch TV options re-telecasts Golmaal Ghajini.
