An average middle class family bend rules give-up ideologies achieve simple goal. And always generation gap deal with. That’s serious stuff. The name movie hilarious. The posters one promotional song I seen made look like slapstick comedy. Hardly…it even borderline-comedy! Not surprising, considering movie produced advertising agency. They really cannot exist without misleading marketing! Overall, movie quite dull. There something right execution, though. It admirable Dibakar Banerjee kept characters simple carefully avoided glitter glamour, song dance. Some parts handled pretty well. For example, way dream used show facet character; way different characters react announcement member family going US; way props used intimidate characters; way IIT-Delhi T-shirts used instead GAP. But then, ordinary characters identify with…get boring! It lacks intensity, crispness, needed make movie subject. The plot help much either, nothing exciting happens movie. If story couple twists, could kept interest alive. Thankfully, songs play background, help break monotony. Watch good performances though. Anupam Kher makes heart go Mr. Khosla. I especially liked Navin Nischol’s role way played it. Parveen Dabbas, Tara Sharma, Ranvir Shorey show learning experience. Boman Irani plays creepy property dealer. Now, way character presented irritating. For one, character inconsistency. In first half street-smart personality second half simplest person pulled wool eyes. Then acting itself. Boman Irani thing left nostril smirks, make look character. It worked first minute screen time, that’s nostril half-lip stayed movie. In opening shot, cool lighting lower half face bottom-up camera angle makes look sinister. But effect used characters loses significance. While photography, wide angle over-used. Also, annoying expressions character change close-up shot zoom-out shot different angle. Maybe, deliberate purpose larger scheme things. But watching movie, I time think cameraman doing, then, either cameraman job right director.
