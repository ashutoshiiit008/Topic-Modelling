Those seen horse racing real life, course heard much famed horse called Secretariat, love movie. Those haven’t, one shows life Secretariat happens behind scenes horse races. Based true story, movie Penny Chenery/Tweedy (Diane Lane) who, unwillingness sell father’s farm, ends owning breeding one greatest racehorses. A semi-retired trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) took responsibility, probably best job one could. And groom Eddie Sweat (Nelson Ellis) knew thoroughbred longest time, handles dedication handled several winning horses. The chestnut colt one youngest horses win races, two records still stand today. At slightly clumsy pace, movie exciting times. It slow un-happening large parts one might well sleep through. But extremely well-done sequences compensate glitches. The dialogues par, good lines there. Most conversations fail engage, could phenomenal inspirational lessons. But makes film look real unexaggerated end. I would honestly loved see better acting Diane Lane, she's free genuine. The forced dialogues uncomfortable body language lead huge put off. Malkovich apt little-crazy trainer role, I sure, comes real Lucien Laurin. The best Nelson Ellis (Yes, Lafayette True Blood), limited role gives precisely father’s reflection grooms much famed horse. Margo Martindale justice father’s secretary, Miss Ham around horses races Tweedy looks family. Appreciable Otto Thorwarth plays horse’s jockey, real life jockey wants pursue acting. I really enjoyed second match seen TV Tweedy family saw it. It recording actual race. Also races, last short show real action. I also enjoyed mute nuances, said lot dialogues. The movie good deal slow parts. It great story lack pace directional competence make one martyr. If really keen, watch screen.
