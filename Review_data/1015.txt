Take romantic relationship one couple involved other. Then, exaggerate - sometimes bit, sometimes quite bit, almost always slapsticky - Ugly aur Pagli. Now movie could copy of/inspired movie other. But, really matter - it's story anyway. So then, inspired life general? Maybe. Except fit 2 hours 4 songs! And however realistically present idea, going rush story last 20 minutes it's going digestible. What love? How crush become crush? When good friendship turn romantic love? If 'anything' keep person happy, would defined love? But then, wouldn't 'anything' keep closest friends happy? These questions Ugly aur Pagli makes think about, new questions, means. But questions tries play out. They played simpleton Kabir (Ranveer Shorey) weirdest things hope Kuhu (Malika Sherawat) smile genuinely. He wants reach darkness Kuhu hides almost successfully eccentric attitude towards him. She turn, leaves stone unturned embarrass himself. All wonderfully carried screen Ranveer Mallika. Yep! Mallika too! Of course, can't cry take load emotional scene yet, she's believable prankster mode. And manage pull scenes she's snoring and/or drunk. But, again, complexities character hardly shown us, told way voiceover. Ranveer simply cast well play good-for-nothing, unconditionally smitten guy-next-door. Though, I must say I OD'ed voiceover end it. It's always there! True it's point view, would great expressions talking too. That's it! There characters!! I always wondered Hindi cinema 'pure' romance movies. There's always family, career, exterior factor weighing dynamics relationship. So, go. You movie twosome. And doesn't turn well, mainly happens first 5 minutes repeated next hour half, albeit occasional witty dialogue. There's one idiosyncratic, little over-the-top episode other. Then, suddenly there's rush actual story shows writing almost afterthought. The songs seem like afterthought. The songs out-of-tune rest movie almost sense director's awkwardness there. It saddens see actor like Ranveer resorting coordinating hands, legs "look-in-the-moving camera" name dance. And this, audience wants heroes dance. Oh, way, anyone inform Mr. Anu Malik changing name "Aanuu" credits 'the' change needed. Itâ€™s music needs change! There two things I enjoyed though. One action sequences scripts Kuhu writes. Although editing action doesn't let actually get thick things, stylization makes worth watching. Especially set around otherwise low-budget movie. The thing subtle tributes paid movies recent times, like Johnny Gaddar, Jaane tu..., Aamir, I'm sure I must missed couple. Sure, Ugly aur Pagli amusing times, establishes one character really well, raw appeal it. But, not-so-funny slapstick times, confused character, ruins raw feel last twenty minutes.
