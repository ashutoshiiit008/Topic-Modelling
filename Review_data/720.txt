I guess actor left play badass, Robinhood-cum-Krishna cop Sanjay Dutt. With Policegiri that's done dusted too. That answer questions loud, full action, predictable, etc. There tinges surprise course Sanjay Dutt's character Rudra takes end. Also, dialogue spark lines plain lame. However Prakash Raj, typical, villain politician Nagori, bit conviction watch even though feels like seen avatar. His comic timing impeccable dialogue delivery. On hand, first half hour film, Sanjay Dutt sounds like he's talking chewing betel nut paan. After that, get used it. The rest act pure action do. In vein, Prachi Desai woman action film supposed - look pretty give hero's conscience nudge need arises. There bleak hints wisdom Nagori refers difficult cater ego irony Sanjay Dutt questions senior officers politicians support someone booked terrorist act. More comedy irony, actually. Considering Policegiri banks heavily action sequences, action, related editing post-production work action pretty awful. In competition awful song dance routines, including music. So, saving grace terms Prakash Raj's performance lines, Policegiri barely anything going it.
