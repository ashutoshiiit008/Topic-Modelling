You know plots typical slapsticks four good-for-nothing men friends reason. And reason end homeless looking landlord fool. Or friends good-natured landlord, beautiful relative, one eye on. Or good-natured landlord/landlady harassed foursome come rescue. Well four element Paying Guests. And guess what? It doesn't mask random name, says upfront, "Paying Guests". First things first. The plot clear outright copy Marathi film Ashi Hi Banwa Banwi. What say writers don't even bother change details? Of course changes, especially towards end. But changes copies MAYBE tributes films. Despite though, laughing. I'm inch away self-proclaimed slapstick-hater-thus-basher. You imagine ego hurt I found laughing unstoppably lines. Of course, I rationalize it. Many, almost all, jokes predictable. They timed would expect ace comedians/actors like Javed Jaffery/Shreyas Talpade. Though even couldn't pull dressed women look distasteful. Chunkey Pandey Ashish Chowdhary manage get smiles too. Yet, there's nothing spectacularly remarkable comic timing joke per se. The hilarious bits reactions actors joke itself. This best experienced rather read about. Now, experience worth tolerating 2 hours non-stop non-sense? Especially inevitable loudness exaggerated body language associated genre. With people running helter-skelter, hiding closets, banging stuff. This brings us entire range non-acting over-acting - Delnauz Riya Sen Celina Jaitley - eye candy remains - read names list, right? The characters story doesn't seem received much attention. And yet, silliness climax beyond expression. It looked like makers couple pegs down...actually make four, writing/shooting it. And might well downing too, enjoy one.
