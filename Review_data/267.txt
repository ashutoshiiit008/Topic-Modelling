Each life story – boring may there’s story. Dil Kabaddi chooses 2 couples going 2/4-year itch (7 y\ears way long) display one issue causes – boredom. The basic disinterest finds interesting leads boredom. And underneath boredom, might chance upon layers confusion one wants life. All complexities relationship explored lens sexuality. Sexuality addressed directly there’s room innuendos. It’s direct refreshing considering topic taboo Indian society. And yet shock. You begin discussing relationship head, couple screen discusses friends fight. The situations seem close urban relationships real life – simple complicated need complications, satisfied one needs mix masala keep alive. Or maybe simplicity satisfaction illusion behind characters found cozy corners. The movie get generic Hindi movie’s comfort zone given women characters identity men displaying insecurity. Over period two hours, fully aware character’s sexual needs don’t get much peek emotional ones. Their need companionship, compatible companionship given. Something supposed doesn’t require explaining. And I left thirsty. I wanted know better, gray characters were. But, I denied that. And despite wonderful portrayal confusion, frustration, indecisiveness – Irrfan Khan, Soha Ali Khan, Rahul Bose Konkona Sen Sharma. Together help maintain light vein seriousness handled. Case example would Soha Ali Khan thinking paint colors room bed husband ad real-life brother. The light-heartedness equally attributed background music. Just like music composer seems love ensemble it, I fell love music. As flirting mood characters without getting overbearing. My biggest complaint sense discontent I leave theater with. Of course, I’m asking back-story, thank goodness didn’t give characters any. I’m asking know little characters – aspirations sexual fantasies, need company lust. And enough room since scene seemed stretched exaggerate situaion, camera lingering around little longer need grasp situation. Even something interesting cheating spouse. Extra-marital relationships seem like flavor season. Dil Kabaddi focused one aspect romantically-inclined relationship, picked 3-4 types characters gender, mixed different permutations make perfect soap-opera. Yep, I managed squeeze juice various interesting angles medley have. Now, I tell you, ‘one’ aspect relationships chosen ‘sex’? The juice back, right? Not entirely enough make sit through. Because, it’s interesting see people make mundane lives.
