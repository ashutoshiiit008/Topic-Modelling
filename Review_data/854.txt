Is anyone else worried future fairytales grew with? How come place think twice taking children Snow White film? I’m opposed adaptations, purpose adaption make grotesque, violent version tested narrative, choose one used bedtime story children years? How would feel suddenly tomorrow Goofy turned evil-menacing werewolf-cum-canine ferocious animosity humans? Similarly, Snow White The Hunstman mysteriously dark potential memorable action-fantasy film stunningly creepy visuals performances, seems like making violent adaption primary motive. In case, I would preferred violence ruggedness translated different plot. The basic story film – killing king, Snow White’s father, Ravenna (Charlize Theron), evil step-mother imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart) castle. Vanity Ravenna’s vice, pursuit fairest all, willing go measure. The dwarves aren’t characterized Sleepy, Happy, Bashful etc; Snow White demure damsel distress. While deconstruction seems refreshing paper, plot goes particular direction. Ultimately, Kristen Stewart’s performance cold can’t tell difference Twilight film. Chris Hemsworth also looks like he’s dropped Thor, film. Besides, role almost negligible. Charlize Theron star performer film – positively sinister make flinch once. The rugged quality film however, brought well. Snow White The Huntsman serves interesting adaptation potential compared Mirror Mirror released earlier year. This mostly mood film takes entire 180 degree turn original fairytale. Writer Hossein Amini (of Drive fame) first time director Rupert Sanders together bring together gritty texture manage engross bits. While action visual effects-heavy seems bit forced, colors mood make below-average acting manage suck particular points film. For reasons particularly, feel angry end result film resembles complacent effort. With rough makeover celebrated fairytale, Snow White The Huntsman could powerful much immersive. For now, film lauded attempt, mostly feel rising sense disappointment end result.
