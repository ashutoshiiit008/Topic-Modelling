The 2010 Kick-Ass, directed Matthew Vaughn, caught attention audacious violence profanity-laced comedy offer. It since gone acquire something cult status. (If I remember correctly, also made Quentin Tarantino’s ‘Favourite Movies 2010’ list.) Though I wouldn’t call fan first film stretch, film quite amused brand no-holds-barred comedy violence. (Not mention I’m always enamoured superhero concept, even treatment tongue-in-cheek.) The problem sequel, new director Jeff Wadlow – one question existence of, apart obvious financial reasons – sorely lacks set first film apart. Audacity. The violence, comedy outlandishness plot toned make bit dramatic instead, high school identity problems, paternal issues likes taking centre-stage instead. The film laughs offer, course, runtime shade 100 minutes, mercifully doesn’t test patience much, despite odd cringe-worthy moments. Though pace film largely brisk, really slows pretends look serious issues. You’re always waiting everyone come terms identities already, get makes film fun – ludicrous humour action. Every character stays well over-the-idiomatic-top really makes film tolerable watch. Aaron Taylor-Johnson reprises Dave, still adorable. Chloë Grace Moretz pretty much steals show Hit Girl, action well spontaneous lines. Nicholas Cage, played Hit Girl’s goofy father Big Daddy first film, sorely missed. But make absence presence one favourite movie stars time. I won’t reveal who, I must confess, I idea film I watched it. In case don’t either, I don’t want ruin surprise you; I nearly jumped seat cheer first appears film. Apart appearance said movie star, best moment Kick-Ass 2 me, line appears Dave’s t-shirt late film – again, something I’d rather discover yourself. Though Kick- Ass 2 nowhere close first film, enjoyed Kick-Ass, possibility you’ll like one well. Otherwise might find film profane, violent silly. Some, though, call ‘niche’.
