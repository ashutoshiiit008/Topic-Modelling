Despite impressions social online media seem giving, films released week well, ones caped crusader main protagonist. One them, Mumbai Pune Mumbai director Satish Rajwade’s latest film, Badam Rani Gulam Chor, interestingly written narrated film engaging part, even often transgresses tad silly. Upendra Limaye, Anand Ingale Pushkar Shrotri play three friends live together house named ‘Unbreakables’, something supposedly signifies nature friendship. What characters named doesn’t matter, refer ‘Chaku’ (knife), ‘Maakad’ (monkey) ‘Pustak’ (book), respectively. Enter Mukta Barve, nicknamed ‘Pencil’ - woman destined change lives good. Simultaneously, Anand Ingle’s character works news channel, currently covering major political story, bust two politicians belonged party. There inherently nothing new either stories themselves. But start watching together, start seeing near-metaphysical connections them, start drawing parallels two suddenly seem far similar appears surface. These two story lines, parallels drawn sheer thought behind intertwining tell story sets film apart. In fact, concept level stroke sheer genius. A tantalizingly intelligent use medium whose power currently shackles easier done make money pushing envelope risk losing it. Using comedy backed strong performances, film tries hard justice thought, achieves measure, completely. The reason? Instead going full throttle concept connecting two seemingly disjoint stories using power narrative editing, effort seems providing screwball comedy instead. Not bad idea all, one ends affecting basic premise. Still, Badam Rani Gulam Chor manages audience splits part, least razor sharp dialogue extremely talented actors mouthing them. Limaye, Ingle Shrotri top form, looking feeling like characters way. True, almost seem walk around signboards bearing character sketches it, part adds charm it, fact least director didn’t hold back far top taking things. Yet, feels like promising film went unfulfilled. The concept narrative technique needed evolved vision guiding hand take fruition; hold back required go need arose; realization opportunity, material like this, might arise tomorrow, make now. Badam Rani Gulam Chor kind film that, treated right, would made intimate, stimulating watch, home video cult. As stands, series smart-and-silly laughs would make passable weekend viewing tube family outing theatres.
