Robert Rodriguez – really? Where Rodriguez Sin City Planet Terror disappeared? After watching fourth installment Spy Kids series, I happened pass McDonalds – I bombarded merchandise Spy Kids. It makes wonder – director? Spy Kids – All The Time In The World Spy Kid 4D fourth movie Spy Kids series, dealing Spy Kids department become world famous solving crimes. It sparked first movie kids Carmen Juni (Alexa Vega Daryl Sabara) help parents (who spy agents) espionage mission. Spy Kid 4D tells us aftermath success OSS (world’s top spy agency). Jessica Alba joins film two step children Rebecca Cecil (Rowan Blanchard Mason Cook) fight sinister Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) attempts take world. To fair, first movie, plain simple Spy Kids, fresh film filled mazes, codes, pranks anagrams. It gave many children fantastical space, unexplored Harry Potter series. But we’ve seen many films (especially children’s films Hollywood) – 4th installment star make film’s worth triple fold (Alba) – high technological placing (4D, we’ll take later) story. It’s pretty much like moving, technology spewing version toy I see fast food joints. Alba takes kids along mission, Rodriguez manages throw laughs – banks scatological humour, work kids. But seems like he’s written movie sleep. The overall effect film – watered visual effects, bad chroma backgrounds horrid acting almost everyone’s part worth time, put mildly. You almost wonder film made lesser Rodriguez’s $7000 debut El Mariachi. The Indian release however seen 4D effect all. The film promises 4D Aromascope effect allows smell feel film well. Except, I given regular 3D glasses nothing more. And I’m even surprised. I’m told many multiplexes country actually followed 4D scheme. The film Rodriguez watermark though – see witty moments entire series Hispanic dominated, one thing remains constant. Kids find robot dog (voiced Ricky Gervais) pretty amusing, he’s stupid funny humour. For following series, Antonio Banderas Carla Gugino (parents previous films) missed – much respect staying one. I set write super nasty piece Hollywood considering kid’s entertainment biggest commercial venture decade; I realized something. If Robert Rodriguez gets leverage indulge independent films like From Dusk Till Dawn series, Machete classics like The Faculty Desparado – makes commercials sewers like these, I think allow mistake.
