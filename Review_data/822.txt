This movie rivalry two music composers based New York. The key word 'two'. Who wins Himesh Reshammiya Vs. Himesh Reshammiya? Don't know that. But, I surely know loses. Us! Mind you, supposed believe one actually genius. All absolutely nothing distinguish one composition other. I thoroughly amused Reggie (Upen Patel) taunts AJ (Bobby Deol) silly lyrics tunes. Actually, stating facts. But I burst laughing starts singing lyrics. They equally bland! All obviously written none Sameer. Now, started rhyming across songs - 'jhoom jhoom' 'boom boom'. The least set make musical provide entertainment via visually appealing songs. Better use colors would added infinitely experience. How decent choreographers casting better dancers? Of people, Bobby Deol?!? Maybe camera man getting enthusiastic, would able focus aerobics disguise dancing. Speaking camera - close-ups way many. Okay, granted, reason Kangna Ranaut Celina Jaitley movie curves endowed with, catwalk picked name body language. But, going show face close-ups, I mean, that's really want do, least complete face chin all. On side note, Kangna's eye make-up worst I seen long time. And Celina refuses give whole-hearted smile lest spoil make-up. I totally convinced Upen, Kangna Celina come school under-acting where, know, teach all-in-one expression punish move eyelid quarter centimeter (except blinking). And Bobby Deol comes school over-acting, acting yelling imposing melodrama audience. Oooh! Does mean perfect performances average then? Never mind... The script lousiest characterizations, alas, cannot blame characters lousy! Egoistic psychopath Vs. Overconfident nincompoop. Anyways, empathize none cheer find way hospital reason other. The shoddy screenplay doesn't help all. Some scenes look like thought first squeezed movie seemed cool, e.g., fire scene. Honestly, basic premise story - competitors trying outsmart - - could compelling watch. Especially, dwelled upon psyche self-acclaimed genius actually mediocre. But, basic premise left that. It finds support none aspects film-making. We, thus, left product head tail - could accused high expectations wanted anything like reason logic. Borrowing line movie, "What don't know, exist". How I wish I know movie turn would make exist...
