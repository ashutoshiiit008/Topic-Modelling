Men Black 3 reasons remind loved first film. It’s revives recipe made Men Black success decade ago: many laugh-out-loud moments, roaring chemistry actors, nemesis worth salt film doesn’t solely rely VFX heavy sequences define action.Men Black 3 uninhibited, chemistry Jones Smith crackling movie makes feel nostalgic last time theatre watching first part. (I’m deliberately excluding 2nd part series; let’s call one derailed attempt.) This time around, Agent J sent back time 1969 prevent nemesis Boris Animal, (crazy convincing alien performance Jemaine Clement) killing Agent K. This task lies fundamental restoring agency’s security, headed Agent O (Emma Thompson). This leap back time involves Smith jumping 40-storied bulding New York, don’t love that? Well, beginning. The next hours film duly entertained, majorly hooking plot growing relationship Agent J younger Agent K (played Josh Brolin). Brolin younger K absolutely bang-on mannerisms find wondering awe ever choice original role Agent K. Smith usual humorous self, growing friendship plays backdrop dire need save K snarling menacing Borris. Back 60s, find convinced time-leap made. The set, costumes characteristics infact, 60s. Unlike first film however, charm lay unpredictable humour caught off-guard, Men Black 3 possesses subtle version humour. You find engrossed happenings, mostly contrasts two characters (Brolin serious unaware, Smith constantly jabbering), find always hoping more, plot/characters/action jump extra mile. Which don't. Much like first film, rewarded action-packed fight sequences right amount special effects, although 3D seemed bit forceful could done away with. Men Black 3 must watch loved first film – rightful journey nostalgia. For haven’t followed series – watch film Will Smith, who’s always stellar performer, reminder fantasy films made 90s.
