So, there's cool-dude Rajnikantha. And people absolutely love route sunglasses cigarette take get destinations. Among people can't stop going gaga invincibility. Sample this. Me? I find silliness funny. The sunglass-cigarette routine make smile 3 times. But then, gets repetitive thus predictable ultimately boring. Exactly happens Quickgun Murugun spoofs Rajni. Our man, Quickgun Murugun - cowboy, protector cows - job, viz, protect cows fanatic non-vegetarian, Rice Plate Reddy. To fulfill duty convinces officers world send back world. And forth. Sounds outrageous out-of-the-world hilarious. But ain't ROFLarious. There isn't much comment make films, right? There's usual ricocheting bullets super-power-like action. Acting intentionally over-the-top overtly melodramatic - one - okay except maybe cameo Vinay Pathak. So direction, especially terms long pauses enhance already outlived-its-stay drama. Or even emotional drama punctuates flow film, exaggeration everything every frame. But, it's spoof, it's obviously deliberate supposedly necessary, say? Certainly allowed complain. However, bits pieces work. These make smile occasionally smile grows wider. Each character's name cackle each. Also lot smiles hidden background, art-work, reference that'll make sneer - joke smartness noticed it. Another bit I completely enjoyed background score. It's creative it's funny. There's one bit western-film theme music playing flute. Nice! There also comment super-heroes God-like humans necessary get rid filth society today. A good vs. evil war obviously portrayed dev vs. daanav (God vs. Satan) war. What's more? Like Lord Krishna man one love interests. There lot tiny comments tucked too. Like irony anti-vegetarian demons use different vegetables weapons. Celebrities used advertise commodities, Indian's love mother's cooking, mother's pride well cooks, etc. But novelty wears off. With things I liked found funny, first couple times. The third repetition onwards became boring. So much one half hour seems long sit this.
