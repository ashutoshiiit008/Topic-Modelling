Miss Lovely - takes world live without going - sleazy world "horror" films intended titillate. A world two brothers making films - one wants move porn films wants make clean, romantic one. It uncomfortable ambiance intentionally so. Which fine, overtly tries go "art-house" cinema you. Flitting showing behind-the-scenes B/C grade films inner angst crew member whose heart isn't it, Miss Lovely's writing doesn't justice either plot characters. Sure, I admit, I biggest fan B-C-D grade films, theme film isn't appealing. On hand, I always ready travel character, whatever background. But, Miss Lovely, denies that. And that's frustratingly usual didn't much hook in. It brilliant performances setting real gets. It quirks catch smiling wryly dark humor. It commendable indeed, theme porn world, movie doesn't get graphic. Given that, I ready let go typical elements film engages - jealous dying "star", clamoring struggling actors stoop levels land role film, on. What writing fails understand setting far removed real worlds, becomes ever important engage viewer either narrative characters. One thing troubles films camera gets over-excited. I understand hand-held jitters bring confusion screen - apparent inner, impact lost overdone. In fact, one hand-held sequences done close-ups ironically distance what's going film. That's root there, connect - isn't there. Certainly downer, film wants experience, rather superficially know. Yet, cannot take away fact, brave indeed make film like Miss Lovely.
