Easily ubiquitous franchise pop culture, James Bond film always event. The franchise tilted ever-so-slightly towards cerebral underwhelming Quantum Solace. Continuing vein dialing entertainment value notch, Skyfall, directed acclaimed Sam Mendes, infuses sense grounding reality escapades The Spy Who We Love. Skyfall isn't usual James Bond film. The gadgetry, Bond girls wise-crackery toned favour delivering emotional, personal film. This film also gives 007's boss M longest screentime she's ever had, isn't bad thing. That isn't say film particularly well-written. While film intriguing most, writing last hour surprisingly amateurish tardy. Also, film seemed least two action-set pieces short. In spite this, film still works primarily Daniel Craig, director Sam Mendes, delightfully evil villain Silva, played Javier Bardem and, all, work cinematographer Roger Deakins. The film dives straight action, 007 hot heels man stolen top-secret 'list', one clearly headed wrong hands. One thrilling action set-piece later, Bond presumed dead M takes call leads shot. However, loss best agent turns least M's worries, new threat lurking shadows. Dressed suits fit like second skin, Daniel Craig's posture, piercing, blue eyes rugged salt-and-pepper stubble make intriguing Bond yet. There always seems much unsaid screen makes root super-spy even more. Director Sam Mendes handles action scenes well, climactic sequence particular. Though writing weakest part film, Mendes manages keep things continuously interesting. Javier Bardem Silva superb. His understated, unapologetic malice works well makes unpredictable villain, right till end. Few Bond villains intriguing striking him. Judi Dench returns M great job always. Her no-nonsense, deadpan demeanour integral part film, almost deliberate wrinkles add much character presence. But Skyfall, opinion, belongs legendary Roger Deakins. His gorgeous frames lighting, generous use silhouettes lens flares make Skyfall visually pleasing Bond film memory. And helps Bonds ever looked good silhouette Daniel Craig does. As mentioned earlier, film could done little action. However, action scenes film, superbly executed. Action works best VFX camouflaged well, film almost always is. For expecting certain kind Bond film, kind James Bond seems almost like character espionage-based comic book, Skyfall may bit letdown. I also got feeling members audience seemed find film little dialogue-heavy. However, much appreciate Skyfall, particularly fans character genre. Skyfall, certainly, raises expectations next one.
