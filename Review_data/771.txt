Sometimes, mere thought reboots, remakes sequels coming Hollywood days exhausts you. In fact, even complaining become passé. That quite I felt I watched Red 2, despite fact stars dependable names think of. Now names I’m talking terrific usual. But, yet again, predictable contrived plot meanders around apparent reason lets Red 2 down. It fun spurts, never enough truly elevate film. Taking previous film ended, retired CIA agent Frank Moses call center employee Sarah together now, trying lead quiet life. However, Frank unexpectedly put run learns he’s hunted man again, may something Cold War weapons project. Then ensues madness. Yes, deadpan humour keep company throughout length film. And there’s Bruce Willis Frank Moses, always kicks behinds even he’s sleepwalking role. Most importantly, least personally, there’s Helen Mirren, who, brief role, shows boys – Willis included – gun must truly handled screen. Together John Malkovich reprising adorable character Frank’s friend Marvin Anthony Hopkins turns best performance film ex-scientist gone bonkers, cast film ensure least aren’t shifting seats throughout, waiting film end. But writing takes blatant liberties forces many conveniences throat, you’re always questioning logic film, even though know supposed to. And I’m talking fundamental premise near-sextagenerians numbering single digits bringing entire squads themselves. Every time heroes easily enter buildings, known heavily fortified best security, wreak mayhem escape unscathed, purpose seems almost pointless, heave sigh, wait next bit screenplay frivolity. Also, action films almost norm day, seems become difficult truly design execute path-breaking action late. Save one fun car chase sequence Dame Helen Lydia Mirren adding delightful - ahem - icing cake, even action déjà vu variety. Director Dean Parisot, whose last theatrical feature watchable-but-forgettable Jim Carrey-starrer Fun With Dick Jane, seems specialize precisely kind film. Besides, I couldn’t help feeling, once, cast little bit league. They seemed run autopilot, without firm hand director’s vision guiding them. Or I expecting much there? Red 2, quite like predecessor, would make passable DVD watch. In fact, purely effortlessly charming cast, two films back-to-back wouldn’t make bad lazy afternoon double feature. But don’t expect walk theatre leave feeling completely satisfied.
