3 issue-based films day - Two related global political situations (Lamhaa Tere Bin Laden ) one addressing social issue needs immediate attention (Udaan). Lesson end day - two ways looking matter importance. Bear colloquial usage - one 'load leke' 'chill maar ke' (seriously lightly). Tere Bin Ladentakes chilled-out route how!! The snotty attitude I towards slapstick satire, I'd never imagined I'd laugh even combination both. And I wasn't laughing loud, I forced wear wide smile subtle references current affairs. The tongue-in-cheek remarks hardly ever stop. If words, prop, something background vying reach funny bone. The sequences situations also one fun one other. And happening constantly making remark futility war unashamed mask righteousness people wear justify killing other. If remark stereotype. Every bit makes realize much thought gone making point without creating drama, it. While first half setting situation second half goes surreal easily call Tom & Jerry affair. The transition bit disorienting. But so-silly-and-farfetched-that-you-have-to-laugh situations use dark humor, spoof stereotypes, mockery media, ridiculing reality shows. They tickle, make think, get worried characters, one go. I wish I could give brilliant understated statements made. I wouldn't able take conscience I spoiled even one gag you. All I tell Ali Zaffar, Pakistani reporter lands situation makes Osama look-alike make statement US. He puts together entire crew - make-up artist, voice artist, editor, actor, executive-producer type. You imagine crazy get done right. And done right is. May I thank Mr. Abhishek Sharma exactly believed without heeding supposed commercial requirements. No hero heroine woo, over-the-top garishness heck it. I know it's shame live times make us appreciate things avoided film, rather contains. But once, winner achieved more.
