Staring computer. Checking thesaurus. Wrecking brain. Checking thesaurus again. There really word "predictable" wholesomely describes Kismat Konnection's story, dialogues, character transformations, etc, etc, etc. The title clearly says it's konnected kismat. So, points asking set Canada (or Kanada?) Which also means demented complain happy coincidences boy meets girl, loses her, wins back maybe not. But looks like, asking 'unique' coincidences asking much. Movies like staple diet growing up, dear movie makers! It's high time begin respecting show us something more. And zip tacky symbolic lights-out-luck-down, lights-on-fate-bright bit! It truly makes eyes hurt rolling. And dialogues effect, brain involuntarily says words two seconds characters do. Before, I control so. Hell, let alone dialogues, lyrics songs prose set tunes, poetry. And, music didn't work promos didn't work watching movie. Well, it's like one doesn't moments. Juhi Chawla lines given splits 7 minutes screen. Then there's one scene Vidya Balan's character, Priya describes idea ideal match, culminates lovely romantic moment. But 9 minutes I enjoyed movie. The romantic moments either one movie's team romantic 80s (stuffed toys gifts, p-l-e-a-s-e!). Or real romance cheesy it's better portray dream world squeaky toy make heart-broken girl smile think genuine romantic situations. Vidya Balan one actor convey sensuousness facial expressions doesn't really need 'hot' body convey that. Which means need leather pants wardrobe, lady! She looks great though, least much better I thought would Heyy Babyy. Thanks camera decisions mostly focusing upper body charming face. And that's end intelligent smart camerawork decisions. Because, lighting uncanny way making streets Canada look like studio sets. Or actually sets? And it's obvious director Aziz Mirza gotten used directing Shah Rukh Khan almost half movie, I remind it's Shahid Kapoor I'm watching. And completely doesn't work tried pull Amitabh Bachchan Namakhalal spouting fast monologues sport. But then, there's thing Shahid's eyes make wish gets girl even it's expected thing happen story-wise. Yet puppy eyes fail convince he's struggling architect magically owns largish house Canada, convertible, large screen TV yet broke. So, you're allowed forget operative word title "Kismat" - luck, fortune, destiny, whatever would like call opening, boring voiceover monologue Shah Rukh Khan reminds you. klearly kommon kismat konnection like it.
