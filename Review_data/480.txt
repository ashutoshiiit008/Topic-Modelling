Jo Hum Chahein cheese sap worst. It's long time since I've seen many women getting wooed crap acknowledging crap. So, supposed smart yet fall whatever intended fall for. Beats me! Theoretically, always least one thing nice say film even hated it. That usually comes form dialogue - weâ€™ve ruled - basic plot situations acting least music. But, na-ah! It felt like I watching school play teacher said, happy means :-), angry means :-| sad means :'( said flat dialogue delivery. No voice modulation necessary. The music sounded generic though lyrics decent. Note word 'some' there. At times, lyrics trying cool words like disc CD thrown in. Anyway, it's like going go watch film lyrics. There fleeting things I thought pretty sweet superficial film. One character says, "I used I could." Another character forgave another blunder wanted forgive melodrama emoted way. These two pretty insightful things characters say do. So much actually seem accidental set-up. Yet, nothing Jo Hum Chahein average enough watch even it's playing TV. Skippity-skip!
