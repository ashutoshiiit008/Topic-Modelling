~ ~ ~ Update: DVD Review ~ ~ ~ Such pity home video manufacturers prefer make single-disc DVDs today, packing film well special features one disc. Luckily, Man Steel DVD shortcuts. Packed nicely designed outer jacket illustration DVD case, Man Steel DVD two-disc pack, with, obviously, film one disc special features other. The film likely quite takers part DVD collection, excellent features second disc truly makes Man Steel DVD interesting. The first insightful 25-minute featurette titled 'Strong Characters, Legendary Roles' - talks cast crew recreating iconic characters American - indeed, world - pop culture film; Superman, Lois Lane, General Zod likes reimagined, still retaining core characters. The second also 25 minutes long, featurette titled 'All-Out Action'. Man Steel truly spectacular action scenes. This video goes behind scenes, giving audience peek went making action film - right physical training actors underwent, designing green-screen action stunt work. We get hear number people otherwise never get hear about. We thus appreciate sheer magnitude takes achieve finally see screen - guys truly create magic. After first two, third featurette rather tame 6-minuter titled 'Krypton Decoded', video Visual Effects Supervisor film, takes us technology designed Krypton film. Thankfully, film also comes multiple Indian languages - Hindi, Tamil & Telugu - apart English. Man Steel projected 'event' film, DVD film reflects same; liked film, you'll love DVD. ~ ~ ~ Original Review ~ ~ ~ Delving far deeper (than previous screen adaptations) Superman origin mythology well moral dilemma extraordinary planet ordinary mortals would face, Zack Snyder’s Man Steel, backed formidable writing team David S. Goyer Christopher Nolan, manage camouflage big Hollywood summer blockbuster quite well. More reminiscent Nolan’s now-legend superhero take – it’s nervous, edgy hand-held camera constantly move, attempting infuse certain grittiness moments hero struggle basic problem existence – choice – film ‘feels’ different another gargantuan VFX vehicle. But, ultimately is. Relentless spectacular visual offering never easing fundamental conflict young Clarke Kent faces ultimately rises become godlike protector humanity, core predicament film finds fact attempts pack much many good things. One grand, terrifically executed action set piece, followed doubtlessly termed Nolan-esque peek world’s widely known superhero. Repeat; times count. By essentially following structure (which, incidentally, also non-linear, particular first hour), film almost ends becoming much take. The film opens planet Krypton, brink self-implosion; scientist Jor-El chooses save newborn son sending distant foreign planet, larger aim ensuring continuance species well. Infant Kal, son Jor House El, thus finds Kents Smallville, Kansas. And thus begins long search meaning Clark Kent - search sets collision course General Zod, former military leader Krypton, also tied intricately Kal-El’s past. Reminiscent, times, The Matrix terms superhero origin story (with Biblical references boot, I’d rather discover yourself, you’re inclined), film also reminds Nolan’s Batman Begins manner Kal-El’s search meaning treated. (Think images stubbled Bruce Wayne’s tryst street thugs crosses paths Ra’s Al Ghul.) Man Steel, however, falters big good. Despite overcooked, film undoubtedly audio-visual treat. Hans Zimmer’s score moody, orchestral grand; goes great film. Few shoot action way Zack Snyder does, thought action 300 Watchmen shot well, wait till watch Man Steel. However, writing film appears weak sheer number big action scenes has, directorially Zack Snyder looks little sorts comes emotionally intimate scenes involving Clark/Kal-El parents, birth father Lois Lane. Henry Cavill grew film. Despite seeming like fish water initially, retrospect, perhaps young Clark felt growing amidst people rejected ‘different’. By end film, Cavill easily makes best Superman recent times. He’ll perhaps never match popularity Christopher Reeve, Superman different anyway, away red underwear. Russel Crowe Jor-El terrific, despite truly incredulous lines deliver. Michael Shannon General Zod tad disappointing, perhaps rare villain much moral ambiguity him. If look things point view, you’ll realize one easily justify stance film. In scenario, ‘triumph good evil’ remains questionable, hence, unsatisfying. With nearly 2.5 hour runtime, boils down, then, expectations. Set right don’t expect completely blown away film. You’ll good time, much Snyder & Co guarantee. Expect film put The Dark Knight The Avengers shame, film bound fall way short.
