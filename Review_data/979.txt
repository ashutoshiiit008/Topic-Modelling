Who decided woman must fight prove worthy existence? When decreed women are, way all, inferior men; lives mean daughters, wives mothers? Why even today, world seen humankind create unbelievable miracles – many women – still ‘reserve’ places women government organizations? Why even urban, educated India different standards men women? I must 5, maybe less, I first heard ‘saying’ behind every successful man woman. It rankled back then, still does. We’ve seen, years, women ones blamed ‘degrading culture’, chastised ‘stepping boundaries’, questioned possessing ambition, even physically attacked ‘embracing Westernization’. If sickens you, Nisha Pahuja’s documentary, The World Before Her, hit gut. It hurts like films recent past. There two extremes India – modern, urban, high-flying often ugly world unbridled personal ambition; traditional, conservative, fiercely insecure India guards past far welcomes future. The World Before Her juxtaposes two, objective possible view place women worlds. Ruhi girl barely teens, semi-urban India; girl aims make big Miss India pageant. Prachi, hand, young instructor Durga Vahini, women’s wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad – self-appointed custodians Hinduism (or Hindutva, they’d prefer call it.) As take look Ruhi’s journey – represents many like – unforgiving, relentless training undergo beauty pageants, can’t help feel sorry fact much woman’s self-worth determined external appearance. True, pageants men well, rarely ever claim spotlight way beauty pageant women does. So strange society unashamedly patriarchal finds competition pits women basis looks far appealing one men. Prachi’s tale, hand, scares you. Here girl thankful parents letting live despite born girl, willingly embraces harsh, physical punishments father; girl derives almost perverse pleasure power domination young girls, many teenagers, trains Durga Vahini camps. There times camps almost feel like militant training camps; acceptance belief violence solution enemies Hinduism – big monotheistic religions world, Western culture likes. Most people find sympathy least one faces India. The ones fall middle, feel uncomfortable questions asked schools thought, ones affected film. Both worlds, though starkly different other, find parallels well. Diction expert Sabira Merchant, trains Miss India contestants way speak preparation rounds pageant, refers pageants ‘factories’, churn polished, modern Indian women. The Durga Vahini camps also like factories, spawning hordes women raise fight time calls it. Both worlds precise routines, specific methods rigid structure participants can’t break free of. While Ruhi, Prachi girls come across film representative journeys women like follow, also become characters invest in. It hard miss moistening Ruhi’s eyes talks dream becoming Miss India making parents proud. It extremely difficult view Prachi mix apprehension sympathy, talks hates girls ‘girlish’. And look closely Ruhi’s face subtle changes see film progresses – you’ll see Miss India preparation took biologically-induced toll beautifully flawed natural face well. Interestingly, documentary almost crafted like thriller. It switches two worlds smoothly, goes on, you’re almost holding breath, wondering happens women meet film. You wait see respective journeys lead them; two paths merge other, you’re left stunned, nagging questions haunt you. Almost like children, looking television, wonder they’re looking people world inside box, people inside box looking world outside. The film restricts way women perceived two contrasting worlds, think it, also questions two worlds itself. Which real India? Is ‘Western culture’ threat rich heritage? Or culture dynamic evolving construct option change time passes? How woman stand massive audience comprised women, fiercely speak woman isn’t supposed think ‘career’? On hand, so-called modern, liberal world pageants, women taught stand, walk, talk twirl. Their legs supposed certain way, chins supposed certain way. Fingers, toes, wrist, neck - everything fixed position project confidence personality. Doesn't sound liberal now, it? Another terrifying thought take film communally charged country India is. Day-to-day life might seem peaceful, literally armies trained majority community country scary. It makes wonder minorities similar notions ideas. All simmering facade relative harmony. When explode anybody's guess. The World Before Her kind film write talk longer imagine. Hence, also important film; discomfort engenders measure face represent, ugly world live in.
