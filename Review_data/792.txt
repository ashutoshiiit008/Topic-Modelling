Exactly you'd expect, Rowdy Rathore mix clever lines delivered rowdy style much melodrama. The action every bit macho played much gusto. And exactly you'd expect, Rowdy Rathore hasn't iota logic paper-thin story. So, yes fan masala Akshay Kumar, it's package worth every bit ticket money. For others like us, it's exactly you'd expect - laughs silliness all.Amidst silliness though, introduced Shiva (Akshay Kumar), petty crook, doesn't mind letting world know thief, hates children; qualms thugs friend. In fact, given example establish character. And begin admire consistency character even though he's 'supposed' hero film, asked lose hope major character development. For seemingly rhyme reason, chooses tolerate child he's annoyed rather way. When lead character given shabby treatment, didn't really think female lead would accorded respect, we? Not title like Rowdy Rathore. While Shiva's lady love, Priya (Sonakshi Sinha) thrown screenplay, per convenience, Sonakshi little role offers. She lacks grace dance equally rowdy. However, age Kareena's Katrinas, rubenesque proportions welcome change. It's shame looked like chose go 'waist double' close-ups supposedly slippery waist. That breathed really hard close-ups. There little damage control could've done couple scenes handed towards end.Then villains thrive humiliating people - men, women children alike; weaker better. Living heart country, law applies them.Amongst many clich√©s rowdiness seeps comedy, action, romance sundry predictable emotional moments. And film starts melodrama, doesn't dip right end. This consistency makes Rowdy Rathore 'entertainer' requires laws story-telling, good film-making. The attempt symbolism hilarious expressed literally - raping police references mythology Ram Krishna, everything spoon-fed.What I like though amid lot violence, child artists largely protected part even witness it. But couple scenes children witness utmost brutality makes wonder design coincidence. But that's small reward (if even called that!) seeing Akshay Kumar Shiva dressed pinks, reds, oranges, yellows, lime greens purples. You imagine loud background score go bright colors. But I get that's central theme - loudness. While Rowdy Rathore certainly film I'd recommend, carved audience people aren't going wait recommendation.
