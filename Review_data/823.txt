Once Hindi film makes refer Marathi essay I wrote ninth standard. After six-page long journey solider “Autobiography Soldier”, abruptly released captors got frustrated silence, like teacher put it, writer got bored writing. Shamitabh's second half suffers similar grounds, climax. In addition technical mumbo-jumbo first half, even short, convenient. So, despite attempt storyline different routine, lot writing comes across writers got bored patch job get point A point B. A baritone wonderful is, performances keep interested, make Shamitabh decent watch. Shamitabh lingers little much, artistic, let-the-audience-take-it-in kind way. To contrary, extra moments stays say Rekha's face hears familiar voice, actually seem asking audience, “Get it? Get it?”In fact, point early film, I amused old man Amitabh disciplined like child twenty-somethings, almost like parents. And lo behold, scene later film, makes sure get it. A Bollywood real life references, Amitabh Bachchan's dislike nomenclature Bollywood bus conductor rising stardom, R. Balki sprinkles film nods industry. It cute lasts, but, like always references like divert attention film's story fact film. Same goes product placements, “justifiable” may be, blatant. With two struggling actors struggling director center, inevitable Shamitabh point least things wrong industry. From rigged award ceremonies actors speak depending whether got award actors taking control aspects film-making, Shamitabh bit. External references advertisements aside, techinical glitches forced writing aside, heart Shamitabh war brittle egos. Amitabh Sinha, old, haggered cranky failed actor four decades ago unsurprisingly wonderfully played Amitabh Bachchan. It stumps every time, comes screen two things happen – chews scene yet see character playing, case arrogant, drunkard. It commendable indeed Dhanush Akshara Haasan hold presence. Even so, Dhanush's talent seemed under-explored Akshara good play – young, aspirational, assistant director. The moment asked something “filmy”, slips scene. The guy plays Amitabh's chaperon screen presence too. Unforunately, theme ego clashes voice face, man man, one incomplete without seems like side. As evident I felt like bringing first film, things bothered rather concept rich left unexplored. While I huge fan voice rapt every time I heard it; I huge fan man extent one people I think earned right arrogant; I think personality whose career deserves film, – I'd like see documentary film blatantly that. Not film masked story incomplete voice without face clearly overwhelmed voice.
