Love elusive. Whatever heart seldom within reach. In fact, often we'd like, even 'really' want escapes us. This broad stroke Kiran Rao paints Dhobi Ghat. She quietly, hand-in-hand mild, four subdued characters. It actually feels like she's reading diaries us. She passes judgment society form - young old, rich poor, "educated" illiterate, secularists socialists. But almost mute goes it. And none gets boring BUT spark conspicuous absence. Like leftover champagne yesterday - yet flat relish-worthy cork first popped. The setting could New York, Sydney, even Pune. Any reasonable-size town likely slum dweller larger-than-life aspirations, NRI poking around slums, artist attitude, unsuspecting immigrant trying figure city out. Kiran Rao chose Mumbai I'm complaining. Mumbai way providing warmth ruggedness, exact texture Dhobi Ghat gives maya-nagri. Besides, I love city I romanticize visits like Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra) home videos. Her awe evident discomfort. Her resolve find amusement boring life ironic considering hustle around her. It ain't new contrast hasn't come movie earlier. Isn't amazing city even stray dogs seem rush, housewives (other Yasmin too) entertain TV middle day? You observe Yasmin along Arun (Aamir Khan). Her simple story absorbing. And it's intriguing Yasmin aroused emotion attachment complex Arun. Maybe that's meant be, Arun supposed evoke indifference. But characters don't make feel anything leave dissatisfied movie experience. Arun might weakest character four. After he's one gets relatively melodramatic subtle environment, albeit towards end. And yet everyone me. Arun manage capture Shai's (Monika Dogra)imagination. A large part Shai represents stereotype returned-non-resident Indian poverty tour. But emotions Arun make feel reach her. And turn also want good things happen Munna (Prateik). You know desires beyond reach, smile immaturity want learn mistakes. I loved person grows become. Like not, character written detail arc own. And keeps viewer going otherwise dull ambience. There brilliant, mostly-earthy performances; except Aamir Khan pretty much stays star is. There's also slight touch humor. But, slides documentary mode every while. There certainly conclusions, strong messages, nothing called 'entertaining'. The intention leave audience high dry. Yet seasoned festival delegate find Dhobi Ghat like every 'decent' film sees. And masala-seeker might curse money spent Aamir Khan brand. It in-betweens film work best. And takes nothing away debutant director Kiran Rao. I like casting. The charming faces aces sleeve. I like milieu created, especially home video parts. I like taste background music decisions use not. And yet I can't point finger fine wholesome experience. Maybe I'm made see lonely one us is, matter background is...
