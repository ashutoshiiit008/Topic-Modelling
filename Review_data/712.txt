Films like Phata Poster Nikla Hero make wonder larger purpose. What drove makers make film? So, theme wannabe actor landing situations force become real life hero. Squeezed mother's aspirations son. All made silly, case take seriously. But, laughs drain repetitions and/or labored explanations. The story knows stop running around circles much like characters supposedly comic climax fight sequence. Andaz Apna Apna elaborate absolutely hilarious last fight sequence - purely silly beyond comprehension. Phata Poster Nikla Hero seemed gearing something similar. Unfortunately, wasn't even close. Also, sensibilities changed since 90s too. Which pretty much said Phata Poster Nikla Hero. From texture film characters like righteous mother - film dated feel it. As makers relishing nostalgia, rather make fresh film. The thing fresh film Shahid Kapoor's performance. Yes, role film's genre require loud is. Yet, certain composure performance within context character. He over-acts yet constraint get annoying. Ileana D'Cruz hand irritates soon enough, especially places required pause words effect. The timing wrong. Though cute see Padmini Kolhapure back, performance theatrical ever was. Darshan Jariwala, Zakir Hussain, Sudhir Mishra go dos like would third film do. I must say though, times can't help laugh silliness screen. Much like Andaz Apna Apna - despite annoying self-referencing jokes strewn across film. But, course, times far between. Less often completely out-of-context songs picturised completely different tone make misfit even worse. In general, I find silly comedy cumboresome. Even Andaz Apna Apna, arguably silliest took time grow me. At least, went there. Phata Poster Nikla Hero seems like writers lost steam within 30 minutes run-time. How supposed hold another two hours?
