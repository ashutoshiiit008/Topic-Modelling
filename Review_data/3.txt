Four friends. One girl, three boys. Delhi. Attitude times few. To top off, one cabinet minister's son. They seem interested good time. Given set-up Fugly actually caught surprise group four friends seemed interested good time got worked social issues - eve-teasing law order-politician nexus. It shame then, Fugly doesn't capitalize fact issues touch characters' lives personally too. Despite easy identify them, could barely care happens them. The culprit paradoxical pace. There much going film extent almost feels like thriller. Yet, dramatization, slow-motions, extra time spent elaborating scene - kills film. I huge fan silences impregnated moments. I love lingering scenes. But, Fugly shows go wrong want tell maker, "Got it, move already!" I guess time, place movie everything. The four lead characters played actors either loud flat. Amongst actors, course Jimmy Sheirgill looks like someone take seriously. But, again, becomes repetitive predictable. I doubt blamed actors writing haywire - screenplay dialogue. The story interesting, irrelevant sub-plots. Almost like, coming story writers came list issues wanted address - eve-teasing, corruption law order, hooliganism ruthlessness politics, angst youth, insensitivity media, prositution, gay prostitution, rave parties on. They came story fit everything. And that's way tell story, it? The song dance sequences break jarred flow. They make matters worse run-time already stretched beyond patience levels due editing/screenplay decisions. Style add content, laboured kind style. I'd still like believe Fugly could've different film, even better maybe, fixed pace issue. But again, maybe would different film altogether.
