If you're keen watching Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, there's good chance you're fan Robert Rodriguez's first Sin City, based graphic novels Frank Miller. (Rodriguez shares director credit Miller faithfully recreates images graphic novels.) The first one went cult film. It disruptive, entertaining, gorgeous high-contrast, black-and-white frames made visual treat. Visually, A Dame To Kill For follows first. It also still pulpy intriguing, doesn't taut writing execution made Sin City much fun. On contrary, seems like one trying hard. It picks characters threads story first film, adds new characters fray, follows similar parallel narrative structure see deteriorating morality abject disregard law-and-order we're quite familiar fictional Basin City, popularly called Sin City, because, know, name suits residents better. That's sanitized way describing film, course - money, power, sex crime. (Though won't get much number 3 list watch big screen, thanks censor board. There pretty blatant cuts, usually accompanied groans seems rather deprived urban audience.) The welcome addition cast storyline Eva Green, plays moral-less, cold-hearted schemer possesses uncanny power men, uses tramples suits her. Hence tag line film. Green seems made habit best thing sequels stars (remember 300: Rise Empire?), doesn't quite give film sting deserved. Though film briskly paced, seems longer 100-minute run time film narrated voice-overs characters - pretty much outline what, things philosophical-sounding rants attempting pass story-telling. You want film grab gut, that's expect Sin City. But ends feeble. Part reason could fact cinema audiences changed since first film came out, lot exposure understanding blurring moral lines today. So obviously, unless film significantly upped game 'let's shake things bit' department, wouldn't nearly kind impact one would hoped. The additions cast - Joseph Gordon-Levitt Josh Brolin - make hay darkness shines, somehow end feeling going motions; Robert Rodriguez, honest. It still good fun watching unrecognizable Mickey Rourke Marv pounding guys heck it, ladies Old Town deadly rear guard revel being, film still doesn't ever make feel like you're witnessing something spectacular. As companion piece first, would make fair lazy weekend DVD watch, that's it. Besides, want watch film uncut, let's face - Sin City isn't quite without sex. I'm big fan Robert Rodriguez, mainly story - way chased passion cinema despite next nothing, ended A-list Hollywood director. (For cinephiles, book 'Rebel Without A Crew' must read.) Despite up-and-down filmography, always seemed like someone wanted push envelope. His last films, though, haven't quite seemed way. Let's hope gets act together soon, hopefully far thrilling Sin City 3, case plans make it.
