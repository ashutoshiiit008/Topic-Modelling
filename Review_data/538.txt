A coming-of-age film protagonist starts loser, good-for-nothing. Been there, seen that. But Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi tries hand different. It goes "coming-of-age" bit non-conventional, non-likeable way even. It adds little zany it. But, unfortunately end, plummets worst kind run-of-the-mill. Kuku's cousin Prabhakar helps clueless Kuku Bawarchi kind way. He happens around help anyone needs help Kuku's family. His means might honest ones, get Mathur family members want, do. Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi share annoying, loud characters. Their existence seem make film feature length short. The satirical bits writing induce humor. But, stretched long wonder writers satirical really believed hocus-pocus shown. The borderline spoof using spoof medium show exactly thing spoofing. Interestingly, humbug craziness film begins. I quirk films, one gets literal instead staying subtle comes bit late film too. Then left performances. Siddharth Gupta Amit Sial ones you'd remember walk theater. And maybe Pallavi Batra loud character plays annoyingly aptly. None enough make Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi watchable film. And what's seemingly profanity title? Or maybe I don't want know.
