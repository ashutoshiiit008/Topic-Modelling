The fact last film I saw Matter big screen Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, nothing I eventually felt Matter. A film poorly written even school plays parodying ‘Indian Idol’ seem better, Matter kind film that, apart nothing cause Marathi cinema, may also ended adverse effect mind young boy sitting parents last row screen I saw film. He probably grow believing magic cinema. Three young kids growing rough neighborhood Mumbai commit murder avenge rape sister one them. They sent juvenile delinquent home reformation, become friends another young kid, Ronnie. Together, four grow become main leads film, four wastrels can’t find decent work branded criminals bhais one mistake childhood. Their solution? “A bad name better name, let us become actual bhais instead.” And thus begins torturous couple hours comprising primarily guns, girls gaalis (profanity) (or whatever could get censors). Riddled showboating technical gimmickry, including crass transitions unnecessary camera movements, Matter almost nothing right it. The screenplay poorly written I can’t even use favourite phrase, ‘lost plot’ describe it, simply never plot first place. A host mindless characters, situations, scenes, songs twists pepper proceedings merciful end, something I never grateful for. To fair, four male leads, played Santosh Juvekar, Jitendra Joshi, Rajesh Shringapure Sushant Shelar, share decent camaraderie. The best scenes film invariably four needling one another. Acting clearly blood one them, endearing goofy way. It decide want ‘rule’ Mumbai end looking like clowns are. And course, Sameer Dharmadhikari playing bad-ass cop Vikram Pradhan, believes ‘Mumbai saaf toh sau gunhe maaf’. (If Mumbai clean, crimes forgiven) He leads pack caricature-ish side characters including Muslim dons South Mumbai unscrupulous female politician shelters underworld. The film meanders along aimlessly without message story clear single point agenda – ‘let us make cool film Mumbai underworld’, agenda miserably fails at. Clearly, someone held keys safe saw disaster making midway through, starts looking like film certain level production value eventually descends mess digitally shot, poorly colour-corrected footage put together complete film. Matter film best avoided, one children particular must definitely kept away from.
