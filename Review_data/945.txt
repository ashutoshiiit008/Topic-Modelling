The King & The Commissioner hard film critique. While little film worthy mention, almost flaws pounded pulp two superstar leads – Mammootty Suresh Gopi. But let’s face – pretty much best – pound things pulp, punches punch lines. The pair reprise earlier hit characters separate films theirs, time, brought together interest nation (and producers film, doubt.) Still brash, still arrogant still stylish, Mammootty’s Joseph Alex top bureaucrat. He put special mission Prime Minister India (played Mohan Agashe) aided cause none Bharathchandran, played Suresh Gopi – ‘Special Assignment’ yes, still brash, still arrogant possible, even stylish. There absolutely denying nearly everything wrong film. Right opening reels film Pakistanis Malayali accents reveal goal terrorizing India, film’s treatment screenplay place. It one bits writing seems like lot happening, little - many caricature-ish characters, much talk, little meat. Sinfully long nearly three-and-a-quarter hours, extremely exhausting film watch. Far verbose good, woes compounded host unnecessary scenes subplots pepper proceedings right till end. The film ideally (and could easily) two hours long. The big problem film technical aspect. Insanely over-shot over-cut, kind film whose shot breakdown I’d die get hands whose editor I’d love private chat with. It would extremely enlightening know exactly came idea umpteen cuts screen split ways would make butcher feel terribly low himself. Far serious way names taken film. Pakistan clearly villain, attempt mellow towards sake diplomacy real world. If promos Agent Vinod got riled enough ban it, film could severely hamper Indo-Pak ties good ever happened chance upon it. Not mention vicious attacks public figures who’ve news recent past. This film clearly made play galleries, pity. The makers two megastars would set cash registers jingling case. They could used golden opportunity make film topical, relevant engaging without resorting needless sensationalism. But then, two stars screen, really, else pales. The two clearly zones film. They thunderously deliver over-the-top lines ease, often making forget unnecessary lines actually first place. Yes, well past 50 paunches. The remarkable thing however don’t look ungainly action sequences all. Suresh Gopi, particular, looks extremely ease decimating dozen baddies without breaking sweat. The two also phenomenal ability make others frame look good, matter silly otherwise are. Their presence radiates enhances people around them, even people mediocre themselves. Nothing, really, take away fact two fine National Award-winning actors much ease playing over-the-top commercial characters playing real characters sensible sensitive stories. The King & The Commissioner film lot like action scenes – two towering personalities standing sea mediocrity. It kind film I would recommend would need recommendation watch – would watched way. For others, particularly like believe shenanigans big stars big films indulge in, I’d recommend settling nice, quiet book instead.
