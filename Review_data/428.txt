What hero Katniss Everdeen is! She's bold, fearless, righteous talented; she's also rash, impulsive unsure. A heady cocktail grey white, she's kind hero cinema sorely lacked. She also reminds us pity we've genuine female heroes fiction times. Yes, situations around often seem conveniently conducive heroism thrive. And yet, one can't help rooting her, she's rare protagonist whose conflicts often mirror own. Mostly though, sight relishing challenge truly makes delight. Catching Fire takes 2012's The Hunger Games, based continuing novel Suzanne Collins. After 74th Hunger Games saw Katniss Peeta emerge joint winners end previous film, pair celebrities Panem. President Snow, however, also notices young Katniss - monickered 'The Girl Fire' - also beginning become symbol rebellion The Capitol; spark must quelled becomes raging fire. With change guard helm - Francis Lawrence takes director remainder series - Catching Fire seems grittier first film. Life Panem seems grim, consequently, need rebellion seems stronger ever. Simultaneously, conflict Katniss's personal life seems go hand hand unrest Panem. She doesn't want two intersect, yet, life placed juncture two nearly one same. She's beacon hope oppressed need rally around, wants away all, family love. Around this, lavish, obnoxious decadence power, gloomy existence without it, brought sharp contrast - times little stronger completely necessary. The alternating orgy colour dull blue-grey monochrome intended effect, despite obviousness. The film turns particularly thrilling final act - 75th Hunger Games - truly takes saw previous film new level; absolute mayhem keeps edge. Even if, like previous film, lot happens makes things conveniently easy Katniss Peeta. This one problems I first film well, unfortunately seems kind liberty writers director don't seem want take stock of. Catching Fire also soundtrack builds mood tension throughout film, way till end credits, nice tracks play along till end roll. Expectedly, Jennifer Lawrence aces Katniss Everdeen. Fresh media attention, adulation Academy Award flakier-than-snow Tiffany Silver Linings Playbook, spunky actress dons Katniss like character never apart while. Josh Hutcherson, meanwhile, grown well character Peeta, seeming far confident time. The supporting cast - Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson Donald Sutherland particular - manage make respective characters strong traits stand out. The excellent Phillip Seymour Hoffman joins cast film, presence is. His character one intriguing series now, likely play important role ahead. But mostly, Catching Fire works intermediate film series must - takes things notch first film, sets things nicely next one. And also sharp, emotional thrilling film itself. This, really, light spark.
