Just movie animated set fantasy land doesn't mean kids. But, advertise kids' TV channels, implies targeting them. Then absolutely peeves off, instant central male lead bragging scoring 'chicks' opening song. It sheer letdown YRF banner, usually decent-sized, significant roles women, two she-characters mere sidekicks. And sole function one wooed men sexiness physical beauty. Nevertheless, graphic design certainly one giant leap Hindi movies. If story too. Even forget dogs two-legs, salons, dance sensuous moves pubs, basic story snore-worthy. Not mention seen humans countless times. Anyway, one step time, I guess. It sort-of funny movie Aditya Chopra involved writing references earlier movies. Not features EVERY Yash Raj film. So contract writer signs gunpoint? A Yash Raj film mentioned minimum 8 times. There shouldn't lapse 5 minutes 45 seconds references. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayengehas come least twice. What audience know movies!? Anil Kapoor's character, Lakhan underestimated Tashan. He needs exposure. The villain movie mannerisms. You allowed let audience forget real life relationship lead pair. So, yeah likely enjoy another movie full digs films, one might completely enjoy. Once accepted that, imaginative smart dialogues keep smile glued face throughout. It especially hilarious see audience hoot hear Kareena Kapoor screen. She sure faithful fan following, even she's playing bitch! Saif Ali Khan Jaaved Jaaferi aren't anything especially new voices. They sound little gruffy, digitized special effect layered usual voices. I wouldn't want kids watch something implies much disrespect towards women more-or-less story-less. But, will. And likely going enjoy too. Yeah-yeah-yeah, lighten up, diwali hai (it's festive season)...oh well...
